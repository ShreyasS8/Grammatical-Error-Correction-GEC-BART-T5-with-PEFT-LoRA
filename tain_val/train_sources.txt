My town is a medium size city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high density population because its small territory .
Despite of it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the certer of the city which is surrounded by a park .
Pasteries are very common and most of them offer the special dessert from the city .
There are a comercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kind of establishments : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , groceries , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
Most of the shops have sales and offers at least three months of the year : January , June and August .
The quality of the products and services are quite good , because there are a huge competition , however I suggest you taking care about some fakes or cheats .
People want to be a doctor , other want to be a teacher .
I have my own plan too but I do n't same to them , I want to become a Journalist .
Working as a Journalist is very exciting because many reasons .
Second , I can travel all around the world , meet different people who are very friendly .
Next , I will have a chance appear in big parties or events and I can make friends with famous person - It 's interesting !
Finally , I will have high salary when I am Journalist .
To be Journalist , I must study very hard so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream comes true .
Now days each family has more then 1 car for each one , this is only one of few reason that people use less public transport .
Before was really convenient to go by bus or by train but with the new economy the travel tickets are more expensive and a big difference from the past is that it is less expensive to go far then near .
I remember from my town Palermo in Italy to go to Milan was about 340 pounds , now if we are lucky we can arrive to New York .
In England where I live , in Bedford , we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK , but the train are very expensive , me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high .
I 'm sure in the future there will be car able to fly or you can park them in your pocket .
Furthermore , the biggest group of positive feeling students in the present is live with various nationalities .
The possible reason is these international students can not speak English flowing .
They usually lack of language and can not open a debate .
It is restrict to argue .
In the other side , they might be wanted to safeguard national image .
In order to give a good image and show the national parenting , our respondents tend to have a great pardon to other nationalities .
MORE THAN KIP FIT !
Do you know mountain biking ?
Follow reading to know why!.
I 'm keen on mountain biking since three years ago .
Firstly , I tried with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar .
The main reason why I wanted to prove was to lose weight ( I was a bit overweight ) .
Consequently , I realized that although ciclyng outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed the best breathing pure air and taking pleasure the countryside .
If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to pursue a good mountain bike .
It 's important to avoid accidents , become comfortable and have a good journey .
Secondly , he or she would buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing .
I love this sport . I look forward to the weakened , to go out with my bike and my group of friends .
All of us spend a good time .
And I would like to encourage everybody to prove .
Nobody wo n't regret it .
Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I 've seen .
I do n't recommend it to children lower than thirteen years old ,
The movie is about Lucy 's family that moves into a farmhouse , mysterious and
Also reflects a comparison of Lucy 's family , and characters
from a story their mom read often .
The story actually takes place in a camp , and farmhouse , mysteriously
had a weird painting of two sisters just like her 's , the same ones also of the
The best place for young people in our aree is without doubt the lake .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , have a sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake are so many concerts so you have the difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the scouls are closed per ten weeks so the young girls and boys have much time to spend the
Leaving my country , Soamlia , was very hard for me .
I miss my big house but I do n't miss the guns .
In the following decades revolution and civil smote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born .
I really like to travel , but I like the most when I travel with friends .
is different to tavel with friends that travel with family .
I do not travel too much with my friends .
I just have had traveled two times .
Those two times has been with the orchestra that I play .
In that time I did not know nobody , just one .
But when I was there I began to make new friends that I never thougth I was going to have , and I never thoungth the way that I was going to know them eather . at the begining I felt very strange talking with them , but now we are very good friends .
We stayed in Zacatecas like a week we really had a good time .
We went to play to Acapulco , to an event that unuversities from Mexico go and present like cultural activities .
There was too hot .
In Acapulco I had a good time because I stay in the same room that my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun .
There we visit the central park and we stay in a very luxury hotel .
We were very happy there we really like Taxco .
Actually I was already been there before but not with my friends .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there that was an incledible experience that I will never forget .
then we return to Toluca to continue with my boring life .
And now I have to pass my subjects .
In biathlon sportsmen need to run some races , which a very different , some of that are long , some are short .
But , short distance does n't mean it 's will be easy or something like that .
Sometimes weather conditions are not comfortable for guys , for example : wind , light frog or freeze , all of that are very difficult conditions .
So , it 's not so easy like it seems .
This sport are for real men .
And also most of them are very attractive , big advantage for girls , whose like nice pictures .
That is what everyone say when we ask if they prefer public transport or car .
Using public transport can be not easy , because we have a strict time and normally we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely desconfortable .
Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work , that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
One argument for not using the car is that the petrol price is very expensive , but the public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantange are not so good actually .
For me car is the best and you ?
Well however your choice is , it is necessary to be perfect for your daily life !
However you use Have a nice trip !
People usually tell me I 'm a cinema 's enthusiast , and they are in the correct way . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film especially when it is a thriller than doing sport ,
If you want to see a good thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone because I believe people would like it for many reasons .
First of all , the director , who was Alejandro Amenábar , did a great job due to that , the spectators were waiting with bated breath as the final of this film will be .
Secondly , the actors were fantastic and the main character , which was performed by Emma Watson ( who is really hilarious ) , was amazing .
What 's more , the plot is easy in order to understand .
The history took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by the doctors and cientifics .
Moreover , customs , make - up and special effects became ever more in reality the story .
However , the soundtrack was awful , it did n't get having a scared .
In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thiller must be seen if you had spent a good time given than it achieves keeping in suspense until the end and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have better opportunity to see it than this week , because just moment in Spain the festival 's cinema is happening .
In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country
When we ask ourselves , how can we take care of the environment ?
The first thing that we think is the pollution , the car smoke , factory smoke , etc ... but , have we thought in the food or clothes ?
perhaps when we are buying in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask to assistant a bag o similar to carry at home this food or other things .
We can take a bag from our house , because if we do this every time that we are going to buy in each shop , we do n't spend more piece of plastic or paper .
But we do n't have forgotten the cotamination by cars , We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion .
Also in the sort way , we should go walking to the destination.icle
If we are working with sameone in the same jobs , and who lives near or he is our neighbour , we can go to the work in the same car , this way we use less oil .
The governents are also important for taking care of the environment .
They should have healthy habits and with their examples they can improve the habits of the population .
I love sports but I did not get much opportunities to play a sport . I born in a village in India , my parents are farmers like most of other villagers .
The only play ground in our village was the school ground which was full of small rock and not good to play any sports .
When I was a child I help my father on his jobs after my school .
We bought television in 1888 , after that I became a fan of cricket .
I was watching most of the matches .
Sachin and Ganguly was my favorite cricketers , I love their batting .
It was summer holidays and Michael 's family was in the airport waiting impatiently their flight to Mexico .
That was a special family it was so big ; his father has 6 brothers ! , so he has 17 cousins counting his little sister .
In total they were 32 pelople , a white kittie and a dog .
About 10 minutes later they started to get bored , they heard a girl calling they to enter the plane .
Michael used to have a great time with his cousins , except with Tom .
That was because Tom liked to give orders to everyone , and Michel did n't liked that .
When the big family get out of the plane , they realize that they were wearing too much clothes , it was boiling ! !
There they took a taxi to the hotel , and at 4 pm .
SOme minutes later they designate how the cousins were going to share the rooms .
Michael finally ended with the last one he would like to ; Tom .
That night , the dog , the kittie , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad .
When Michael get up in the morning , he realize that his kittie had disapeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
He thought that the dog had eaten the kittie during the night , so he shouted to Tom , open the door and went away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
Warm candle light and small tables with patterned table clothes create friendly atmosphere .
i believe it is suitable for our class
So , my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout . I have been exercising this sport already long time .
I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero .
Of course , in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this do n't stop me .
I do n't know myself why , but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise .
If It is very coldly and windily outside , I do n't worry about it and I 'm exsercising at home .
For those people , who want to start to exercise the street workout I 'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .
That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up .
After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more , you can start to study more difficult exercises .
I dare say what I was quite self - confident a few months ago .
But now not .
Because of mind .
Sometimes , a lot of phrases and sentences runs in my head , but how to write it down correctly ?
How can I use to use it ?
How can I force my kids to do his homework ?
How can I explain them ?
Michael got married his close friend since only one month .
But his mother hate his wife and always shout at her .
Unlike his wife respect and love his mother and never complain to her husband these bad situations .
Michael 's only fault that he is a mamma 's boy .
For he always defend his mother and always the wife is the responsible one .
His wife decided , because she loves him , to forgive and apologize for her mother - in - law .
One day when Michael was out for work , his mother insulted and hit his wife .
Moreover she fired her without her mobile or money .
His wife was sad and she cried a lot and she stood on street waiting for Michael .
Once he came , his mother asked him to up quickly acting that she was tired .
He saw his wife but said no words to her and continued hi way .
His wife walked behind him until they reach home but his mother claimed that his wife told her cruel words and acted that she was crying .
Michael believed his mother although he observed marks of hitting on his wife 's shape .
He fired his wife after insulting her .
She was shocked and apologized about a mistake she did not commit .
The light bulb was created on 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison .
This was one of the everyday invents that affects our lives .
Edison said to created the first comercially practical incandescent light .
Some historians claim there were 20 over inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
Edison began a serious research about the incandescent light bulb on October of 1878 , and his original design were in 1879 .
Edison and his research team did his discovery comercialy and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
I think what this is the most useful invention because without this we ca n't live like we live actually .
Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I do n't know what to do immediately , first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay , then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance , finally we call the ambulance without ant delay .
Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that 's why it is getting late .
We were waiting patiently , finally the ambulance arrived and take him into the hospital immediately .
Lately I have seen a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine .
I was interested if I could write such an article and win a prize .
Nowadays healthy way of life is very popular with most people all over the world .
And as for me I 've been going in for sport for several years .
I want to be fit and have a good health .
Go to sports gyms , be active and you will feel in another way .

Your muscles will be strong and you 'll be able to fulfil any difficult job .
The wall of my bedroom are white and the floor is dark grey .
In my bedroom there is a brown bed , a yellow drowers , a little light brown bedside table and a big brown wardrobe .
On the wall there are some pictures of my family , but I do n't nave any posters .
I am living at São Carlos , in the countryside of São Paulo , from Brazil .
In my city the environment 's protection is so difficult .
First of all , we have an extinction area of cerrado closer to Federal University of São Carlos , but sometimes , the area will be used to construct a new building of University .
We have done several movements , but sometimes is not worked .
Secondly , the Hall does n't matter with the environment ; for example , the Hall stopped with garbage 's selection collection when the new major assumeded the hall .
It demonstrate the effort was done in the last 10 years it was over because the new political position of the major .
It is so stupid because the environment need to be over then political position .
Third , we have not founded a green political to eliminate rubbish .
Instead to use a selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or the sanitary landfill ; we have used the dumpfill that is prejudice the soil .
At last , the population , in majority of the times , does n't matter to throw away the garbage on the street or in a prohibited area .
In conclusion , in my city , the concern of the environment 's protection do not working how it is necessary to protection of soil , environment and healthy .
Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they do nt know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy because of all the thing getting from the forest are free .
They damcare about environment because that does n't gave anything to them .
Managemant acountant practice is very important for organization to making decision about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee .
I have been in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world .
At first , I had called a travel agent but he said he could n't be able to book me a flight before two months , so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent .
I believed in him , but I did n't know how I was wrong .
He had booked me the flight but he did n't pay for it , because in that moment he had n't got cash enough on him .
The worst thing was to find it out at the airport .
Environment is always a hurting problem in the world .
There are company so much , they make our life polluted .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country, ... about my village , we use banana leaf stead of nilon , garbage desposal sensibly ... and so on .
we should clean our area to attract visitor and introduce to many other countries in the world.let protect our lung

This summer happened to me several things , I went to the beach , I went to the pool , or simply went for a walk with friends , but the best was when I went to a wedding because it was the event that more memories bring me this summer .
We got there at five o'clock , we had not yet reached many people , so take the opportunity to give the gift that was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new , as the bride loved .
Spent half an hour after we arrived , started coming everybody , there were many greetings , thanks , hugs , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificently structured , plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course , also the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool , we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities , he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .

Once upon a time , there was a monster on the city called " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very tiny city that was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively monster he always migrates to the north every Monday .
In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , it was the contrary , he kill people , destroys complete cities ; he smash all the architecture from the city , and a lot of bad things .
All the people did n't know what that was , so they did n't care about it .
But when he arrived to Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the midnight when arrived , so he was eager to destroy everything .
He was spoiling all the crops from the people , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area .
The next day , he was a very attractive monster , in other words , he was convert in other monster body .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I thing that it have no cure , it was called " The Monsteration Infectations " .
( On those times there were diverse monster , but none of them was like him ; he was in the number 1 rank of the monster in destroying things . )
The scientists are trying to make a cure for the Monsteration Infectations , but they still do n't have it .
In their laboratory , they have a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them .
They had to isolate the chemicals to the formula to have the cure .
Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team in their iPods .
The scientists that were doing the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " Magnificent " .

As per the today topic " No Future for public transport " , I would like to add comments on that please be patient my English is not too good as you readers think .
So , lets start ,
Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves .
Now these days public would not like to travel in the public Transport to save their time as well as money .
Metro is good for even health of the people as no pollution and all because it runs on electricity and also it connect most of the city as Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
Other than that public transport is also not good for Natural resources which is not good for the future of the country .
If you visit Taiwan , you will never miss the temples here .
So , now there is a chance for you to pretend the god .
Jiu - Tian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " imitate the faces and pose as gods " .
In here , they will teach you how to draw the face of god , dance like god , and beat the drum .
I think pay expensive tax on personal car can reduce the use of cars or other vehicles in order solve the traffic problems .
Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy car with expensive tax , so people must use the public transportation , such as bus , subway .
The public transportation will rich , so they can build more station for suburban and more public car to carry this .
Therefore traffic will be batter .

I really overwhelm to be third member of my small family- Peter , Maria , both of which are my parents in 45 years of the same age and my little brother , Patrick-14 year old in a mischievous manner .
Their gentle norm with lovely and adorable mind take a reference to their hobbies - reading .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judge according to the social status and material possessions , that is mostly to happen in high class famiies , as they are foccus on achievements as power , political influences etc . on the other hand for a middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as it is the inheritance from our ancestors in terms of values as honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
Metro is the most comfortable way of transportation in Moscow .
Metro is only one that I use in the city .
Using a ground transportation is not comfortable because of traffic .
Just a few years ago we started to use a special road line .
But the problem is Russian drivers are not getting used to keep this line free .
There is no difference if you use car or bus .
For example American public transport has a special line and a schedule and it works like a train , I mean come in exact time like a train .

One day in October , Michael a boy was studying architecture discovered a box with a message , while he is opening a box , he heard a door .
In this moment a big man went into the bedroom .
This man was his father , who had dead .
Michael was very nervous and confused because he did n't understand anything .
He spoke with his father and he asked him because he was there and his father responded that he had the biggest secret about his family .
" In the past Matilde your mother killed your brother , although she had a reason , he was a monster because he killed a lot of people in our city , so we went to another city . "
This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

In issued notice it clearly states that all defect parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01/06/2015 .
If any more shipments are returned using our old TNT account number , there is no option other than invoicing service center for not following instructions .
So please advise all service centers to return defect parts to Slovakia instead of England .
Nowadays , sport is very important part our life .
Many doctors recommended the practice of sport , because it is very healthy for our body and for mind .
Every day , there are many articles and news information that talking about the benefits that you get if you practise sport .
My favourite sport is swimming because as soon as start this sport you feel better .
In spite of you do n't lost weight , you can win endurance and flexibility .
When I am stay in water I feel free and very hastily .
Not only is sport when you feel sweaty , but also you do a lot of exercise .
However , you do n't have the feeling that you are very tired , is different , at the same time is fantastic !
On the one hand , my advice that I would give to someone starting my favourite sport , swimming , is that you need a little will power because sometimes , for example in winter , you will not want to go to the gym , let alone you get in a pool !
On the other hand , my other advice is that I am very sure that you will feel wonderful and happy!May be not at first time , but sure later .
In conclusion , sport is very necessary and useful for you can improve your life .
You start and then you explain to me how are you ?

Public transport have improved the regional development since the past decade , it 's convenient and necessary for a city life .
But when it comes to travel , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not like to go where everybody goes .
And , it 's really enough development in our planet , it would be better if we can leave some place blanked , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well .
Save some nature to the earth , and leave clear air for our kids .
Build public transport in a city , not in a country .
My favorite sport game is Cricket .
It is very important and very enjoyable game .
Today cricket is very famous game in the world .
Among them cricket is very famous in Sri Lanka .
We could go to in the world from cricket .
It is very great .
Today we have clever cricketers and famous amperes than other countries .
Australia , England , South Africa and New Zealand are very famous country for cricket game .
But those countries are very developed and they have any facilities .
But Sri Lanka is developing country yet .
They have no facilities than other countries .
But Sri Lanka cricket team could won the World cup 2014 .
It is very important opportunities in our countries .
So as I think I can enjoy in cricket than other games .
You can start the cricket game .
Today we have lots of sports games .
Volley ball , Net ball , Elle , Table tennis , Karate , etc .
But it is not famous and we could n't go to in the world .
But cricket is very famous and we know any cricketers .
We can be a famous and earn more money .
Cricket is good for our health than other games .
In my opinion cricket is best for you . You can be a good cricketer .
If I am right continou reading this .
We have a lot of shopping facilities , it is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops since clothes shops , pets shops , food shops , shoes shops , accessories shops , toys shops , presents shops and much more types of shops that know I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need it is not incredible ?
But for some of them you have to search very well because some of the shops are unique and some other are very good hidden , but for that you have specialized transports that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go

Dear pen friend ,
I hope you are fine when you read this letter .
Well , I write to tell about my last summer .
I had a really nice experience working in a cinema . I would n't have done it unless my friend Lucy who encouraged me .
The staff is really interesting and helped me all the time and the customers were gentle all time .
I learnt lots of things such as dealing with money and tickets and watch movies freely .
We got work at four in the afternoon and it is very relaxing . I had a day off that I spent time at home or going to the gym , where I met hansome guys .
I recommend you to try this kind of job in case you want to earn extra money and also meet new people .
Lots of kisses and hugs , please write soon
In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in the traffic jam .
Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more , adding to those the bill that own a car will bring , it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport .
Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do .
In my town for example , I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus .
I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would live their vehicles at home and take a train instead .
Secondly , the environment would improve its state indeed , as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is as far as waste of time is concerned , obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want .
In conclusion I would really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and move around much more easily .
You see man , I do n't like crowded roads , a nd prefere to travel by tram .
It is cheap and eloquence .
I play basketball on weekends since I am little .
I can play basketball and baseball like no tomorrow .
I play with them on the playground .
I ca n't image the life without sports .
In the today society .
The most people are travelling by their car , because the public transport was not convenient for people to use .
Maybe , in fact the lands are more big , so that the transport had not published to anywhere .
The general transport constructions can divided three levels .
On the lands , the railroad and highway is the go through the most city roads .
In the sea , include the route and port construction .
In the sky , include airplane flights and airport construction .
The transport construction and economic development has a close relationship , and utilized of land are more important .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but construc of seaport and airport must with congenital condition .
When integrate of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport constrcutions are convenient for people to use .
I am going to write about how live is going to change in the next 50 years .
Although we do n't realised we have to be conscious
that every day is a different day if we compare with the one has passed .
Some years ago we did n't use the technology to get in touch with friends and family but nowadays it 's the most important thing for
some people who they ca n't live without it .
I am speaking about the mobile how it changed our life .
It will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things but maybe some bad things too .
To sum up , although we do n't want that our life changed it is normal that it will have different changes .
It is necessary for our lives to have or to feel that we are getting better .
My favourite sport is chess because it is the only game for our mind .
It also helps us in studies .
I agree that it 's not physical exercise but a mental one .
There are many physical exercises like swimming but name any game except chess that makes our mind sharp .
I like many other games but the best one is this .
I am not saying that we should always play chess as physical activities are also important .
The reason why I would advise someone this sport is that the children who are not interested in there studies or would not be able to study .
In that case chess would help him .It would make child mind sharp and he would not get distract by the surroundings .
Local transportation is one of the most problem in our area .
The local transportation become difficult and expensive .
so the government must take an action to make it easy .
Public media also must educate people the importance of Local translation and how they preserve it .
The Government must save the gasoline and jazz to resolve the problem .
they must find a solution to this difficult problem .
They must maintain roads .
People also have an important role to solve this problem .
They should reserve the energy by using bus instead of using their own cars .
They also can walk or ride a cycle .
Government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe .
We can solve this problem if we want that .
I have thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers , above all , and making no differences on the sport you have chosen , it is paramount practising some sport , whatever you choose , such as spinning , that is my favourite sport .
My piece of advice to take up a hobby , in this case a physical hobby , which is interesting for your health .
I rather enjoy spinning , feeling the rhythmn of the music lowder and lowder , this gives me high energy each time I went spinning .
If you want to start practising some sport , first of all think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you are having a good time go ahead and do the most of your time enjoying sport , nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured .
the more sport you practise the better you feel , indeed , your mood would not be blue anymore and your body will be thin and gorgeous .
If we take a look on the Swiss public transport system , in the bigger cities almost all people go to work by public transport .
The advantage they get is the following : They dont't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work .
These people also help to protect the environment by saving our natural resources like petrol .
To conclure , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there are no doubts that the public transport system would be less convenient than travelling by car .
The process how to make the notes for the bank can be outlined in six consecutive steps .
First , the bank notes should be considerated how to design included background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are supposed to prepare a skiled machinists .
The notes have special link with colour on both sides , which raised images slightly .
The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city .
If the sheets are bad , those sheets are then destroyed through burning .
Sport is very important part of a healthy lifestyle .
It keeps our body strong .
Today we have a lot of different sports , so we can choose something that really fits ourselves .
It is a kind of thing that everybody can do and it effects all parts of my body .
I literally feel myself stronger after every time I run .
The public transport offers a possible solution for the problem , because much people can transported in one vehicle .
The government should raise taxes for pay for the service .
First , I think the public transport is more expensive .
And if we compare the money you spend with the car and the amount that you spend with the public transport , it is less .
Secondly , if you use the car , you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train , and maybe you can arrive later at your job , for this situation .
I believe that use your car has a lot of advantages or benefits , it is more comfartable and less expensive .
last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free .
The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer .
My favourite sport is doing yoga .
Yoga calms und vitalizes body and mind .
From Monday to Friday I do it at home , at weekends I attend yoga classes .
We can do it at any time as we like .
But if you are beginner , it 's better for you to attend regular yoga classes .
You can learn correct Postures in classes .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history .
In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking , Man has been able to invent machines , which they have been put to work automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work .
The disadvantage , however , is that because of the machines many people have lost their jobs
I read your letter , I would like to know some details about what places do you want to visit .
I advise you to visit Queretaro it has had an excellent service with foreign people since five years ago .
Talking about your new job , I was searching some vacancies however it required a job for full - time , so I am going to continue searching some jobs of part - time .
See you when you arrive at Mexico City
Nowadays people get around constantly .
It 's better use public transport or private transport ?
Well , ecologists say that get around using transport public is more beneficial for the environment than using the car or motorbike .
In recent years the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago .
But actually does it has a future ?
It 's more comfortable , faster and preferable than have to run to take the bus , wait the train , etc .
This is a fact which indicates the public transport there is no future in our society .
Other signals are , for example , if you travel by car , you can park the car in front of the place where you want to go .
But if you take the bus , you have to take down in a bus stop , maybe a bit far from where you want to go .
Also it has to say that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't pollute the air , and then , use public transport wo n't be necessary .
yeah i think it 's statement is quite right because every person have car now a days .
transport are are important but car is more reliable for families they went together without waiting for transport .
more flexible with a lot fun with family .
I live in a city named Tangerang it is in Indonesia .
The Indonesia Government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country 's cleanliness , and the citizen too .
it caused our river some big problems such as disease , unpleasant smell , flood , etc .
i myself , by seeing the river filled with garbage , always seems to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant look from the garbage .
And in Tangerang , the air is polluted by Carbon dioxide and the other materials .
And also , after the river , the road in the city is also contaminated by the garbage .
garbage everywhere .
the condition of my country is really critical , I guess .
And the amount of the city 's garden does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in that city .
There are a lot of high - rise building and it provokes flood along the high - rise building 's section .
I wonder if the citizen in my country and town could make a better environment area by throwing garbage on its place and try using an eco - friendly transportation .
And the government , pls do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
yes , be strict .
I think it 's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizen to be more responsible for what they did . and , I think it 's enough from me .
I suppose , the government also have studied this situation too .
But they did n't do that much after knowing this truth .
I hope Indonesian government take an action about this situation because if it continues then Indonesia would be the most unclean country over the other countries .
She looked like happy and she was looking forward to finishing the class to tell her friend what had happened .
After the class Alison joined her friends .
She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she was fallen in love , had written a letter for her .
Then the friends could not left to pay attention in the Alison 's words .
She transcribed the letter with a lot of passion because it was evident that Juan was interested in Alison too .
While all girls was hearding to Alison , Juan appeared as a gosh .
Alison was like tomato and all her friends laughed at her .
The boy felt very embarrassed , therefore he carried on his ways and he did not say nothing to her .
Alison always through : " If I would not have told this story to my friends I had passed all evening with Juan "
I think that for the public transport there is a future , because over time the gasoline prices and the value of the reparations of the vehicles increase .
Like in other things the prices increase , from the aliments to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , eletricity .. Then the people will choose the public transport in the future .
Swimming has been always my favourite sport .
I used to go to the swimming pool when I was in the school to learn and it became in my favourite activity when I was really tired .
I was with my sister and my friends and I spent a wonderful moment .
Moreover , it is said to be healthy in order to improve problems in the back so that going swimming is really beneficial for me .
In recent days I found out a gadget to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music .
To begginers in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms .
Swimming is one of the best sport to practise it is due to require all parts of the body .
For this reason , it is a perfect activity to do sport and enjoy .
For example : Transport .
There are lots of kinds of Transportation as Buses , cars , Subways , Trains or taixs .
May be they are comfortable , teribble , essay , dengerous or avrage .
If you are late , you can use subway because it is faster , safer and cheeper .
Cars and buses become dengerous and make Problem in the street .
Why have you fridge in every single home ?
Every day people thinking about fresh food , fast food , sweet food and many different types of food , why ?
Are you thinking that emotional eating is your bad habits ?
How many times are you going to shop for some snacks ?
What happened with us .....
I remembered that my childhood was very quite , happy around dinner at grandmother 's house .
Really , I told you that I was like a little bit future girl who has dinner regularly with two portion : soup and meal deal .
So we can started from beginning : firstly , was breakfast which included some cereals with hot milk .
Secondly , was lunch at school like sandwich and some fruit .
After I was in home on dinner time and some dessert .
Could you see how easy and regular life I have got .
My " private menu " included fresh eat like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options healthy food .
Now , I am 28 year old woman who does n't has time for normally dinner because I 'm a very busy .
Today , I wake up at 07.00a.m and catch up some of kind bread with jam , drinks a coffee but more than often just has time for half mug and runs to work .
During a day I have lunch which is from can or order some junky food .
Later , I order take away from Chinese buffet or any pizza .
When weekend coming I have a plan for special dinner which is like home made but do n't have time again .
What happened with my healthy life which I want to have when I was a child ?
Why everything look like more difficult and hard than were before ?
She went to the station train and get a ticket to London .

First of all , finishing high school is a passege of life that indicate the begnin of a new chapter for the students .
Since this moment they will have maturity and responsibility .
Therefore , many of them are not ready for this .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you won a bagage of knowledge , culture , discorves and , with all of this , you won personal experencie .
Sometimes , these is able to change a person , making that she or he have a new perception of the world .
However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel , they start to work .
The job , provides , as well the trip , responsibility and experencie .
It changes in a different way the person too .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are old to study in a uniersity .
Beside that , they have differents points of view in many sublects , that is why they may don ' like the fun and the conversation in the social life with the other students .
They can not enjoyed this chapter with oung and fresh thoughts .
Finally , to make a decision to not go in a university when you finish the high school , is n't the easiest action to make .
It is a great dedcision , that bring great consequences and great experencies .
Whatever are the choice , they will have the mark in their lifes forever .
Be careful and choice it well .
If in a city people are using more public transport than their own private vehicle then it will help to protect environment and traffic as well .
But now a days automobile companies are more focused on the improvements of the cars so that the can be more environment friendly and traffic friendly .
Future of public transport will be measure on the basis of advancement of the private vehicle .
Sometime people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport .
But main concern will be technology .
Technology is being more advanced .
A car is being made so Eco friendly and user friendly that it is more
Many people said that at school all the students have to start a sport and frequent that one regularly .
Is not a good idea because some students have to study all the afternoon for other subjects and the free time is very scant .
AAs an example if a student need to recuperate a subject or have to take a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
In contrast do a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility but the most important thing is that we are always active e our body can get good results .
To sum up , do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take . in my opinion , however , do a sport mandatory is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm not bothered or for obligation
I 'm writing in regard to the watch Fossil FS4735 , similar to FS4812 but with different colours .
I 've seen it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your
products list ( I suppose it has been depleted ) .
However , I wonder if you cold tell me when it
would be available again .
Thank in advice for your information .
In my opinion , they are not my friend . If your parents are your friends , you would live in harmony with them .
They will consider you as a indpendent people .
Accrodingly , You take responsibitity for what you done .
There are some reasons , they are not , are as follows .
First of all , I make my every effort to do my job better , however , they only consider that I waste my time doing wrong thing .
Next , they do n't believe my capability is good .
I do everything but nothing .
They always look at me like a kid never grow up .
It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe ability .
I am ovewholemed with grief , living with them .
I prefer staying alone to living with them .
People often discuss if TV viewing is useful for the education .
In my opinion to watch TV is actually helpful for learning new things .
There is one argument that shows , that the TV promotes us .
The main reason for this is , that the TV is teaching us , because it is an important medium in our lives .
A good example of this are the many informative news , which we are allowed to get .
This clearly shows that the TV is lecturing .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It definitely is also educating .
Some of them believe that it can only entertain us while others do believe that it can also educate .
I bet if somebody wants to have some fun he or she can just choose the right Chanel or movie such as comedies , video gags or funny TV shows .
Meanwhile if an individual wants to learn from TV .
TV provides lots of cognitive programs like cooking , taking care of pets , how to eat as well .
For me , I do prefer reality shows that help people how to deal with problems .
football is the most favourite sport in the World .
Was founded by talented athlete in The UK in early 1900.The Sport was becoming very famous since first World Cup was held in Uruguay until the present .
I really enjoy watching and playing football since I was a kid .
There are several reasons of why people really enjoyed soccer so mush .
Nothing is permanent in this world , I 've knew these words from the mouth of my parents and until now it is in my heart that help me to deal with this kind of life .
Sometimes your happy and sometimes you are sad , nor you are success or you are failed , that is the wheel of the life we are taking .
Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar is going , the flow of life continuously revolving with the world every person have .
Nobody can tell how , when , where and what will happen in the next 50 years of our life .
It depends on how you deal with what you have at the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future .
There are a lot of factors that could greatly affect on what you will be in the coming 50 years of your life .
But the most vital part for these changes is yourself .
Everybody has the right one for a change but it should be for the betterment and not for the worse .
With the simultaneous growing inventions of technologies , way of living go through with it .
A complicated ways from before , advance technologies made it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect next .
The digital age has been a big problem for musical industry because the news technologies and internet had helped more the musical piracy .
The people already do not buy a CD , simply downloads it
It is a shame that a person is working during many moths for after the people want enjoying his work without having to pay , it is literally to steal .
It is like you design a chair and the people to take without paying .
The singers have to adapt and be able to survive piracy , now most their income are the concerts and digital platform like Spotify .
Today , many people , groups or social movements are disagree with different and mainly aspects of our dominant culture ; for example , the marriage or the age for married , the role of women in the family , the religions , the education and new ways of family and many values .
This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as " alternative " , but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society .
The culture is changing in this way , maybe it can be wonderful for the human freedom .
Eating habit in my country really has changeged in the last ten years .
it 's r is n't clear complety , but I sopuse it depends on chenging habit of life in developing process of our sosiety .
At first and important change is about eating prepared food that is n't healthy usually , its reason probably woman 's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they do n't like staying at home and spend their time to making food , now they prefer to buy prepared good .
The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture , but now because of hard and busy life , we had to eat our meal mostly days of a week .
Now , we forget big dinner table that are fulled with family members .
But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days .
Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better , specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we do n't pay attention to it enough .

There is a man who is most important for one 's life .
I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence in my life he is none but my father .
I respect him so much and admire also .
He always helps me by giving good advance .
He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie .
His means of livelihood is the simplest .
He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech .
Nevertheless my father did n't tell him arrogantly but he made him know the right thing politely .
he is a fluent speaker .

Everyone make mistakes , No one say I have not made any mistake in my life .
I have made many mistake I guess .
But is that big problem in our life or small problem or it really does not matter ?

Travelling by car plays an important role in our life .
There are a lot of private transport in the streets .
However travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not such convenient as getting a car , but you would never know what can happen with your car , where it will stuck or some of other accedient will happen .
This fact gives government such opportunity as manage the traffic on the roads , cities or towns streets .
Private transport give us traffic jams , a lot of accidents and stressful situations .
We are getting nervous because we are responsible not only for our life but other people , too .
And also we have to understand that use public transport is cheaper than use a car .
The other side of the problem is ecology .
What can we say about our ecological consciousness ?
Let 's take a bicycle travelling to our school or job instead of using any public or private transport .
Transport is more important for our life .
Public transport is becoming no future because of travelling by car is more convenient .
Public transport are not suitable for luggage 's .
Travell plan need to depend on public transport time .
It is more fun when we travelling by car .
We can play music or talk anything while we travel in the car
If there is no Public transport in some area , then we need to hire taxi .
So If we have our car , it is much easier than using transport .
Hong Kong is wonderful place for shopping , eating and sight - seeing country .

I think public transport is paramount nowadays , but the future will deliver us some kind of different means of transport , such as the car , yes , a car we have been using all our lives .
But this time will be another story because in order to save time and money we are going to use our own car .
Let me explain my reasons , when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want , but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop ... where is your nearest bus stop ?
Then you must pick the subway to your destination , so that means a waste of time , otherwise is cheaper , but what happens if you do n't have some coins to pay the bus driver ? here comes the problem .
You should look for a shop to exchange your money into coins .
Obviously you are late to work , even if you have an appointment to make an interview for a job .

When I have a free time I usually run because I feel really relaxed after that .

That all I can say . I love football very much
yes we can say that for car is much convenient . but every person could not be afford car .
even that price behind fuel for car .
that 's first fact .
and the second one is that fashion or style of young people who do n't like more go somewhere using a car than bike .
after that last point we can not go everywhere using a car we would like .
that have limitation also there .
might be somany people are liking because there are so many service with it .
but it does not means that public transport is not having future .
that fact behind sense because maintainance of public transport is not responsiblity of traveler .
if we want to count function of public transport because it 's not enough words to say . but public transport is most need service in big city as well as small villeges .
It 's not so hard to find sights to see in such a big city like Moscow , but when you have a wide variety of museums , parks , clubs , you will try to visit only best ones .

I 'm only fifteen years old but I think I have a heavy past ..
First , I 've always lived in a kind of little flat which is a social logement .
We did n't have a lot of money but I went to a private elementary school .
I had a lot of friends , too much friends ..
At sixth grade , I realized that they did n't really love me , or even like me .
I remember two contrats moments : One day we had to create a team to make an exercise which used brain , they chose me .
Although , another time , we had to create a team for doing sport , and they did n't choose me .
That get to the second problem I had , and stay now : my weight .
I was too fat , too much fat .. I looked at my health booklet one month ago , and I saw that I have been overweight since I 'm four years old .
Until sixth grade , I thought I was " normal " , but then all changed ..
Learning English is very important by the future of all .
Is a language that many people speak and known .
Later , the people continue in language schools .
Is a difficult language , so , the best option is to go abroad .
In an English speaking country , everyday you learn to live .
People speaking different but with a basic level understand English .
It is difficult to go to a place unknown with different people but is a good experience to learn .
I think if the whole world has only one language would be better .
Everyone could speak and understand .
Not so , therefore , we must study very English .
Because of her suggestions , I learned how to control my temper while I was facing with failures and kept telling myself that was n't a big shame because I had had tried my best .

sometimes I feel tired of walking especially in the sunny days with a high temperatures , but that ca n't let me stop doing this sport .
when I 'm walking , that can refresh me all the time and makes me feeling good .
I want to give advice to people who love thing type of sport ; please do not let it go , and do it as you can , because it 's a benefit sport .
its good idea to improve my English writing .

I have just graduated from faculty of law " English division " from two years ago , with very good grade .
The ordinary result of the big effort I had exerted in my university to have good job in my specialization like a lawyer .
But in Egypt no one takes his right you should pay a lot of money to have a job or knowing someone use his authority to appoint you .

Finally , I see that I have very high marks in education but not have the ability to work in the real life because in Egypt there is the worst education .

We can change everything hurt us if we need if we have volition
The reasons for stress are more diverse perhaps because we have an exam period , family proplems or because we think in negative way , or we destroyed ourselves in long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfortable , and lots of reasons to stress ...
We must get out of the stress quickly before lose ourself because it 's very hurtful period , for example you can read a book , doing sport , play music , eating delicious food , remmeber all the positive thing was took place with you , talk about someone who trust for him , take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring , go out and eat meal with your best joking friends , and there a lot of you have to do ...
Remmeber the stress is not lasting thing , and you can avoid it
But if you are willing to live in happy life .
I am writing to complain about the cafe - Lunch menu .
In my opinion the main course needs a lack of improvement .
Secondly there are not much variety of dessert mainly fruits and puddings .
There is not much variety of healthy drinks , there not much hot drinks as well .
Some people say that in my college are vegetarian , Muslim , vegan e.c.t and they do not have much variety of food to choose like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
It is considered that you change the type of food regularly .
Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy .
It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink .
I 'm writing to you regarding of a letter I 've seen on my way home calling for candidates to fill a vacancy in your cafe staff .
For that reason , this job is perfectly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to improve my incoming helping me paying my bills .
Now I am twenty fiver years old and when I was teenager I lived abroad twice .
The first time in London , for 6 months , and most recently in Berlin , for 8 months .
the movie I 'm going to be reviewing is " the purge "
I actually loved it quite a lot , I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging , it 's just way too interesting , the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime , even murder , is legal , and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call " the purge " and anyone can join it , you can kill whoever you want .
The thing is , some people do n't think it 's ok , and they do n't agree , so they just stay inside and try to survive the night .
The diagrams illustrates the process about producing bank notes .
At the first beginning , bank notes should be well - designed considering the colour matching and artwork including the issues about safety .
After designing , metal plates are supposed to be prepared with the help of experienced machinists .
Then , it comes to the printing step .
Ensuring there is colour on both sides , image is increased gently by a certain type of ink .
Most importantly , before distribution , printed sheets with 50 bank notes per sheet have to be checked whether they are of perfect quality or not .
They can only be packed and distributed when they are with good quality .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are seperated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from going into the market .
That 's how bank notes are produced from paper to the one we can purchase goods in our daily life .
Many people believe that nowdays there is no future in public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the tought that they do help for example for travelling for long distance .
Firstly , there is plenty of people who ca nt buy a car and so the only option they have is to travel by these transports .
The ticket does nt cost to mutch and it is avaible for the majority of the people at least comparing to buying a car .
Secondly , public transports are more eficent to travel for long distance than cars and people would nt have to purchase combustible .
When people are avaible to tavel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , wicth is a public transport , to complete the journey because the have tu cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms .
However , a car is something witch is from the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same way he or she left it , and sometimes public sports are nt left in the best way .
In addiion , you have to share with people you absolutely do nt know and probably wo nt see again .
Consequesntly yo can be stole or get sick .
But , by obseving all these people you can rich yourself with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporate new topics .
To conclude we can establish a middle point .
Public sports are useful but sometimes inconvenient but more cheaper . You can get to know new people and different cultures .
When I was 12 , I went in France for the first time in my life .
That was my first time on holiday in another country that was n't nourth Italy .
I remember i woke up at 6 o'clock for took the train and went to Paris in France .
After 4 hours sat on an uncomfortable seat , we arrived at the train station and then my parents and me went to the hotel .
We fisited a lot of monuments , museums and churces , like the Louvre with the Monalisa by Leonardo Da Vinci .
That week I felt happy and relaxed but I was a little bit sad when we returned in Italy .
I am waiting only to go there another time !
Nowadays my people have their own transport , for example they have cars .
Transport is the best situation for people to can travel around a country .
Without transport people can not go back to work and do something else .
With public transport , is the best way to go to work . Because it is easy to travel .
No need to pay a full amount because they have many people who entered the bus .
Public transport helped us to know our country and improve ours body to move one place to another .
For example , we should walk to go in a place whereas a car can park in the place which we want to go .
It helps us in many difficult ways , if they have a problem we can take a bus and go there .
It will be more appropriate for us .
All village they have a bus - stop where the bus stop to take or leave passengers .
And some bus drive at night to take passengers .
Without it many people will have many difficult to go somewhere or to return home .
However , they have some disadvantages with a public transport , they gave many traffic jam , this is because the bus a large and difficult to control .
If the roads are small , the bus would go in the street .
The bus would not leave the passengers where they want to go , because they have to leave them in the bus - stop .
Day by day the country develop more and more , nowadays they have trains .
Many people travel by train because they arrive more faster than the bus and cheaper in a long run .
The public transport will have many future because some people have no money to buy their own car .
Public transport have help us in many different ways .
It will better if they have public transport .

We met each other next to Oxford Street , when I was going to a supermarket .
She is very interesting and wise person , but the best is her humor .

Nowadys using public transport is considered to be the most convenient
way to move around .
It provides citizen the freedom to relax and disconnect while going home or to work .
However , taking your own car is the much more useful .
And for this reason I honestly think it will be the only means of transport in the future .
For me , the most interesting one is sightseeing around the city and discover its monuments and landmarks .
However , there are also an endless of leisure activities such as going shopping or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks
If it were not enough , you will be able to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to clubs or lounge bars .
In my town people are very educated and very aware of the environment , they know very well that if we take care of the environment then it will useful for us only , so they always take care about the rubbishes and try to clean the village .
Whenever they are going to outside always keeping the plastic bag with them so whatever rubbish thing they will not thrown to the road or outside .
they always keep the rubbish and dust to plastic bag and then they throw to dust bin
D. Perhaps , bilingual school creation might be a good idea of Colombian education improvement , but it will be appropriate to be aware that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education where English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast with the private ones .
Because a majority of do n't have enough resources to pay for it .
The whole picture conveys us the process of making bank notes .
It depends five main steps which include desigh , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and distraction or disposal depends on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Above all , the design is the most previous way we should know , which is considered with the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts .
And the we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most essential part comes out , we need significate the quality of the sheets .
If it 's good , packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well .
In conclusin , the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic .
Nevertheless , in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti - developed society .
To begin with is design , we are able to considerate backgroud colour , artwork , and security issues , and then , we are supposed to preparing mental plates , such as skilled and machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheetsof bank notes , printed(50 bank notes per sheet).There are some requestion -- colour on both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The most important step is inspection that the printed sheets should manually inspected .
If partially damaged sheets exist , the bank notes should separated into good and bad .
In the end , if it is a good sheet , the porcedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , the porcedure is disposal --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed .
I do not know from where I can start .
Back in the 40 's , Cairo was considered as one of the cleanest and the friendly environmental city around the world , Even cleanest than Paris or other cities in Europe .
But the time is changes and things are changing with it .
Nowadays , Cairo can be considered as one of - if not the most - the dirtiest city in the world .
Rubbish is everywhere , people finish their food and throw empty bags in the streets instead of holding it until they found a trash .
So , the ugly truth is my country is n't clean and people do nothing towards this .
In the right corner there 's a sign which says that in this shop it 's not to been allowed to sell knives .
It is a fact that on the one hand you have the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays but on the other hand we are unable to manage this situation correctly .
It is true that there are an increase on violence in the past and it is our duty to tell our children that a world without guns are a better world .

Trieste is a little town situated in the nord - east of Italy .
We have diversified harvest like in the rest of the world , not only in the houses but also in every public building .
For example in our school there is the possibility to collect paper and plastic in different boxes .
In the last year some political men have decided to put in order our city , so for example they put again to place the roads .
In the middle of the principal street , that is next to the sea , there is a divider with a lot of flowers and plants .
So the ambiental impact is very attractive .
We have still many problems to solve in our city .
There are n't boxes for rubbish in every condominium , and we haven't the harvest of the dampness that is present in many other towns of Italy .
Another problem is that the citizen of Trieste do n't pay attention at the ambiental problems of their city .
For example , when a man or a woman has ended to smoke he / she throws the earth cigarette not in the right box .
In other countries it would be impossible , because if someone wanted to do this , he 'll receive a bill to pay .
I think it would be important that , not only in the family , but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth .
In this way we can have the possibility to change .
Today a lot of people do sports , but all sports are not amused .
It 's great for me write about the sport and health .

I have often finished very tired because I never do sport .
Because in occasions It 's very bored .

On the one hand This sport is good for my health I stay fit .
On the other hand I have met a lot of people , they are very friendly .
And finally only I tell you that you should do some sport It is good for us life .

Amount of garbage is encreasing at the same time with encreasing amount of humans .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to encreasing consumption more energy , water and other sources .
Pollution of the ecosystems is groving to in these countries as a result .

It is going to build several modern combustion plants , some programmes for discrete rubbish collection are implementnig .
There are a lot of citizens movement except oficial activities .
People orginise common action for cleaning nearhouse territories .
Some activists plant out trees in spring .
These activities especially have a place in spring and in outumn .
I hope that most of the big enterprises , plants and stations will be taken out of the city border .
this days the transportation become so crawdad .we have a lot of cars in the streets .
there are a lot of accidents because many people driving so fast .
we should put many cameras in the street to know how is caused of this accidents .
if every body know that there are a punishment for what they do and no body can escape from what he did I guess we will have a few of transportations accident .

The people is very kind and funny , and is a very cheap city .
In Cádiz , in summer there are a lot of oportunitis to work .
Cádiz is a beautiful city and you would enjoy a lot of if worked here .
Almost , you are a great athlete so , You could teach surfing , football or other sports .
on the other hand , in Cádiz there are a lot of bars , so , you could find a job with waiter .
Since I was seven years old that I am on my city 's basketball team , and I have no doubt that playing basketball is one of the things that I enjoy the most in my life .
I like basketball because , besides the benefit that it brings to your health and physical - well being it is also a really good hobby .
You also get to meet a lot of people in tournaments or even in normal games .

Nowadays , people are getting more independent , and more than this problem , society now needs to show the other this independence and control of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the one hand , travelling by car can be an excellent way to move yourself for where you want to go , without going on foot to find your bus station and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , as also as you can avoid the confusion of people that are in the subway stations every morning to get in the line you want to arrive at work in time .
On the other hand , public transport are the only resource some people have to move on , and more than excellent to the environment , it 's also a good way to avoid traffic and spend money on petrol , once it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is that using the car can be useless in some situation , like if you go to a football game by car , you probably wo n't have a place to park it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transports be forgot , once more than providing the only way some people have to travel , cars are n't so convenient for some situations .
I think you must go to a large school in the town because here you can have more friends and you can do a lot of other things that you can do in the countryside .
I really want to go to a big school in the town because here in the countryside I can go out with my friends or go shopping with them .
I the town you can do everything fun .
You can go to the shopping , to the halfpipes , to the skateparks and you can do a lot of other cool things with your friends but in the countryside no .
But you must go to the school that you want , this is just my advice ok ?
I really want that you be happy with your new life .
I think that the family and friends are the most important in our lives because if you have some problems they are always here and they try to help you .
These people can influence in our life for example , if you have a bad friends you become a bad person and you will have probles in your live.so , your education depends on the people around you .
It is not important if these people are friends or family , they can change our lives for better or worst , depend on you choose the best thing that it can help you .
As we know , in our days everything is possible .
In general , people have the possobility to study in libraries or using the computers .
Studying in libraries asks a lot of quiet and patience .
There you must n't speak lauder and you always have to wait for your turn to borrow something or you have to wait if another student has the book you need .
Personally , I think studying on a computer it 's a better chooise .
I 'm not saying that just because of the easy way by you can study what you want .
In this way , you can maybe read aloud .
If I were a student that usually studies in a library I would definitely try to study on a computer .
In this way I would n't waste a lot of time .
If somebody says that there is no future for public transport i mind immediately . today there are too many vehicles in our streets .
the roads are chock a block.everybody has a private car .
people is thinking about comfortable life instead of environment and cost saving .
Meanly , the change in the environment .
Also , every year , there are more companies that produce different types of pollution in our planet .
For this , I think that the climate will change in 20 years .
Therefore , the animals do not survive with this climate .
Also , the humans ca n't go to the Street all day , only a few hours for the hot climate .
The live there will be harmful for everybody !
We need to do something to sabe the world !
The members of my Family are certain my real best friends , whose i can trust and ask everything without shameless or regrets .
I think they are our first friends and our first confidents .
All days they prove they are the persons whose care about me .
Thionk about family 's routine .
Every morning they take breakfast together , speaking about things not too important .
They listen to you , discuss our problems .
Sorry for taking too long to get back to you , it 's the end of the quarter and you know how crazy is this period for a sales man .
I would like to understand the benefits of an MBA at IMD and how it would help me on my career .
Talking about the world cup a little .
Watching to our national teams games , I got the conclusion that we have no need to check our heart condition .
Brazil and Nederlands games were a real test for our health .
According to the reality a lot of young people are n't very communicated in their life .
For example in your childhood you are much more happiest than your Parents because their job is not very easy .
They have to look after their children and it 's very stressed I think .
Firstly , young people usually calm down trough the music for example classic music .
But most of young society are not interested this type of music .
for instance they prefer Pop or also rock music .
Through you listen the music you can expressed your emotions and this is the most beautiful thing .
Secondly , they like watching series in a TV .
That make their happy and additionally make loud .
Usually the watch criminal series because it 's very interesting and really mysterious .
A lot of young mans love wearing jeans and t - shirt .
But girls love wearing skirt and snug shirt .
I think the style is very important in our life .
Across style we can express our emotions and feelings .
In conclusion life of young people is not very easy .
hi my name is Adrian i am 17 years old and i am footballer . I was born too be a footballer .
We were playing everyday football in the school and I was the best .
I was even better than the older children everyone was telling me too go to a team .
but i dident had too do anything , a team took when i was 11 years old .
i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football .
I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals .
I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but that s not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me .
I was very happy and of course i agreed .
For my opinion , I 'm definitely agree with that .
Already , for only 20 years a lot of thing because of the technology .
And I think that iy 's not a technology will change but the people and their caracteres themselves .
Unfortunaly , for this generation there wo n't be a real relationship , all relation will become a virtual relationship .
The good news is the average of people who can take advantage of the technology can economise a lot of time because they might have a sophisticate robot can help at home .
According my experience , if we do n't exagerate the way we use technologie like internet , phone , satellite .
It will be the good thing that we can spend our time for a good thing
In some people 's lives the most important is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I think it is important tolook good , but sometimes the latest fashion is not the best choiceto feel happy and comfortable .
For example , now the high - heeld shoes is very trendy but it costs a lot and the most woman does n't look good in it .
On the other hand , the personality is more important and determinative than an expensive dress , it is a fact .
Butif somebody wants to follow the latest fashion , I accept it , because she just in those clothes feels good .
In conclusion , my opinion is that the personality is more important than the clothes we wear , but everybody has his own life and a choice to decide what she wants .
Transportation is one of the most essential part of our day to day life ; whether it is puplic or private , transport takes the same priority in each one 's life from the very early days .
Basically , we 've land , water and air transport for reliable purpose .
In the age before the industrialisation came in to exsitance , people were also using various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
They mostly depend on animal to make cart to ride on them .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convinient .
The developed version of all those engines are use in the running vehicles of land , water and air which make our life more faster .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global warming is one of the prime concern of the earth .
And when we look at the modern technologies of transportation , it glances no future for public transport .
It is inevitably true that , excessive use of public transport leads to higher level of pollution .
So , it would better to go for any other alternative of green technology for future purpose to make this world a better place .
Yesterday , I had a wonderful day .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection , when finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with friend 's of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster , it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream , it was delicious .At night we went to a match of Spanish basketball league , Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep .
when I find me in London , I 'm going to the buckingham palace located in the city of westminster and I 'll see your art gallery and tourist attraction of the British monarchy

Generally speaking , it has been suggested that mixed - sex education will improve to the degree of learning system at schools .
In another way of saying , this kind of education system should be included in the whole classes in all schools .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in the classes , but also it is related to the quality of education level in the schools .
Education has a crucial part in one society and it 's future and by improving the level of educations system , students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , students can not take enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries .
Their systems are no longer that good enough and students will not make a good career for their future .
On the other hand , by building more effective learning system which will provided by local authority , students will encouraged them learn more efficient .
Lack of teaching way , poor audience of the class , quantity of learning materials , for instance , all of these matters should be enhanced until the good quality has been set up in the system .
Besides , by putting these kinds of procedures , students will also gain more respect towards career and their job .
Hopefully , they will reach not only earn more money in their entire life but also society will have more development shape in any other developed counties .
It is true that coeducation can motive the student while they work with other sex group students , we ought to also bear in mind , this is not only solution to get best result .
Therefore , we should consider other kinds of problems which affect on education system .
In a nutshell , based on the above - mentioned point such as , quality of educations system not only interests with mix - education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that mentioned .
It is personally concluded that this kinds of developments will be put into the action for all schools shortly .
For that , is a pleasure speak about them !
I am starting to introduce my favorite family members .
My sister is older than me two years .
She has an important person to me since my 8 years .
Our parents separated in 1980 , when I was 8 and when she was 10 .
Since this time , we stayed very linked until now .
We have a good relation , she is my main friend .
My father is other person important to me .
I appreciate his a lot , because he stayed with me and my sister and his life changed completely .
He invested in our education and today he has much admiration on our life and our decisions .
When I became , first teenager and after an adult , I knew the majority of my friends , a good friends .
We keep a regular contact , we go out to dinner or take a coffee many times .
More recently , I can not forgot my husband and my daughter .
Both are very important in my emotional stability .
How are you ? Hope everything 's fine ,
all here is great .
It 's been so long since we last talk ... and I have some great news !
Well , I 'm writing to tell you that this summer I 'm going to the UK , and I 'd like to hang out with you some time !
It 'll be the second time I 'll visit the UK , and I would n't like to do the same excursions , so would you mind telling me some good activities to do or some places to visit there ?
Also , I 'd like to invite you to my house here in Spain , all my friends and I are having a party and it 'll be fantastic if you were able to come .
Our world is very polluted by public transport so we think about what will happen in the future .Public transport causes many problems in our environment such as , difficult reaching to the nearest destination , the pollution , and causing diseases .
We must think alternative solutions for this problem .
We face difficulty in reaching in our own destination .
Many people who go to their work late .
Using the public transport makes us arrive late because it stops many times .
With our private car , we can do many tasks in our day , but using buses we waste our time , and more efforts .
Buses run with petrol that causes pollution .
Nowadays , there are some vehicles run with electricity.we can decrease pollution by using electricity .
Hence this will help people to be in a good health .
In addition , crowded buses cause affection among people .
private cars reduce the affection .
Crowded buses spread epidemic in our society .
Finally , we hope a healthy future for our new generations . We want to reach our destination on time and live in safe life without diseases and pollution .
my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long .
i like it very much .
i used to play it with my frindes .
when i enter the egyptian armed forces , i played for the air defense forces team .
we won the 1st position , and got the cup of competition.if anyone attends to play this game , he should practice hard to be able to play it proffesionaly .
Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses .
Could I have contact with any of your customer for more information ?
I am looking forward confirmation .
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father teaches me what was football , and I loved it but , I really liked the goalkeepers , why I like football since childhood .
I think football shows you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy football because it is a form to forget problems and enjoy a bit , because when you are playing football , you are n't thinking other stuff , you only are concentrate at the game .
Football is a sport where anything can happen , no always win the best teams and is unpredictable , there is n't a dream team .
The football is a good form to do exercise because it is interesting and funny .
And if you do n't like do sport you can watch the matches of the teams around the world .
The most important invention is the mobile , because you can do whatever you want in only one communication device .
Not only children have one , grandparents have either .
But with this gadget , we have a big problem : people are becoming isolated , we are living in our own world .
You can do a lot of things using your mobile , like : call someone , text , take pics , listen to music , watch movies , play games , wake you up ( alarm clock ) , access the internet , check your e - mails , pay your bills , access the social media , learn how to cook ... there are many more unthinkable things we can do .
But now , children want to have one as soon as possible , they do n't play hide and seek and play sports like before .
And one consequence of this is they have health problems .
Another problem is if your mobile is stolen , the thief can access all your personal life , he can check your e - mail , see your photos , etc .
And people are getting isolated , once I saw a mother using your mobile instead of taking care of her baby !
In the future , it will probably we can almost everything using mobile , but we might pay attention in how this affects our life .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earnings allocation within regular families in two different years ( 2000 and 2010 )
overall , in both years , the amount of earnings allocation predominantly from Housing then followed by food / clothes .
There were a significant rise in the number of budget allocation from both categories ( Housing and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
In contrast , Vacation / leisure and Misc were decrease over the same period of time .
Regarding the pie charts , there were significantly increased in the number of earnings allocation for Housing and Food / Clothes from about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 respectively .
However , the allocation of household budget for Misc , which was the least among other categories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , fell by 10% in 2010 from around 15% to approximately 5% respectively .
Furthermore , there was a slight decrease in Vacations / leisure allocation from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010
Actually , the public transport show really no future .
The governments did n't had been giving good ideas to improve the public transport .
There are two good reasons for doing not use public transport in the future .
Firstly , the no continue the construction of more rail line of train to public transport is a one reason .
Consequently , people prefer move in your own car .
On the other hand , I think there are two aspects that can change the actual situation .
The first is , The government can create a new plan os construction of trains .
The second aspect is , people can help to pay more tax to buy new buses .
As a result , we can have a public transport more comfortable .
In my opinion , the public transport can have future if all we collaborate us to improve .
Unless we do so , I believe no future for the public transport .
There are widely differing views on the issue of whether or not the benefits of study foreign language in earlier age outweigh the drawbacks .
Some people would suggest that learning new language before second school discourage their usual learning and that would struggle their understanding of other subjects .
However , I personally believe that the advantages is overweight .
The reasons for this as follows .
Learn how to walk before learn how to run , the opponents contend the children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue .
Confronting with challenges , primary students are struggled on the difference between first language and the learning one .
Thus , people view that children learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later .
Nonetheless , I would contend that learning foreign at primary school brings countless benefits to children .
Primary school , the best moment for learning , children are easier and faster to gain knowledge .
Not only less study burden when compare by secondary school , but they are able communicating with foreigners as well as extend their societal network during that period and the later life .
Rather than concern about the challenges , children would confront with , it is particularly advantaged for them to grasp foreign language during the elementary school .
By way of conclusion , I once again reaffirm my position that advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outweigh than the drawbacks .
Given that these children would have a better development in the future as well as more free time .
it is a story of a boy , who always find out the way to tease her sister sukh .
one day he got fight with her sister , even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh .
sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot , sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister .
sukh start crying and she said she is not going to give you my laptop until you do n't feel sorry .
her brother pick her laptop and threw it and broke her laptop , then boy closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion people 's lives will change dramatically in 50 years or so , because the world is changing all the time , and we have a lot of technology and things to do .
What is more , they do not the same things as their parents did .
To sum p I thonk it is enevitable .
The door of the room is closed .
Number 's room was 666 .
He knew that she was inside , waiting for the last conversation in relation with the life of Rose .
He pushed the door and come in .
Then she started talking : " Welcome pretty boy , I am waiting for you , please sit down " .
He took a chair , staring her with rage . "
As you well know , rose 's life is your hands " she said and keep talking:" ... You are the only one , that can save her life , but before you must comply with your promise"."I Know it " he replied with a sad tone .
Then she took the document and stared reading in aloud voice : " With this agreement your soul is mine " .
Micheal did not know what think .
He loved rose with his entire soul , a soul that is losting .
Suddely , he took the agreement and signed with his blood the paper .
I do not care he thought , maybe I lost my soul but now she is alive .
on the last vacation I went to France , to Paris with my colleague Sebastian for 2 weeks .
Then we went to the stadium Parc des Princes where we could not reach ,
and due to lack of knowledge of the language , nobody wo nt tell us which way to walk to the stadium .
By accident we ran into a good fairy who , with the young learned to all language in the world and thus led our stadium .
We made friends with this fairy after one entire day walking with her feel like you we knew each other a lifetime .
After the first week in France found that in Paris there is a large crowd .
For this reason , we left with a new friend to Marseilles , where there was less traffic .
We chose this city because of no input into the sea and it was filmed taxi in which he played a famous actor .
After spending two weeks with a fairy in France , we had to go back to school and fairy to do .
How are things ? I have finished my exam yet . I came back Linares two days ago .
I took bad diet . You might come with me !
The exam had made that I do n't practise much sport .
For me , the sport is very important .
I believe that I am a boy healthy , but with all the exams I have abandoned to goods habits of me life .
I did n't have time free .
Do you practise sport this year ?
How are eating ?
Today I will speak with me manager . I will intent drive less and I go to places for mysheft .
I play bike in the weekend .
My mum says that I do n't eat fruits or vegetables never so I will eat more fruits or vegetables .
In my opinion , the Diet of Gym is very bored .
Do you know new recet for cooking chicken ?
One day will be like him .
We meet soon man .
At first we went to our hotel .
It is near to the Hyde Park .
We went to the Hyde Park and sat down on a bank .
A hour later we went to the London Eye .
In the London Eye we can look all over London .
Then we go to the Big Ben .
Then we go to a red bus and drove to our hotel .
Reading opens new horizons , made you imagine .
One of the most favorite books for me is , the power of your subconscious mind .
this book tells you how to use the power of your mind , and how to make yourself happier .
letter written to report , about awful environment situation in my city !
we already did a lot , but still to do more needed .
first of all , rubbish factories should be sent behind the city
people who litter on the streets its one of the biggest problems .
So my proposition is to post some informative letters and posters around the city , and give bigger punishment for littering!Also from the government side to increase of trash bins and facility staff members .
clients search , customers support , conflicts solutions
compilation of wedding arrangements and bouquets
It takes you very long time to get to your destination .
Our town takes care of the enviremont of our neighbourhood very seriously .
On these sites there are different kinds of containers for all sorts of rubbish which you can collect at home .
Like glass , plastic or paper -containers .
In the supermarket you can find a container for batteries .
Not only the supermartket has these containers , they are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion this gives a good example of the involness of the local government .
Another point where I 'm pleased about is that our town is kept clean by a special group of employees of our community .
For the last I can say that they not also put containers for all your rubbish , but even special containers in the parks for the the dogs their ' pooh ' .
So this helps that the children could play in a much cleaner park .
Studying overseas is not only changing condition , but also facing many sorts of unknown pressure .
It is not easy to adapt a new learning environment , the language is the biggest difficulty .
Students have to do assignments with another language and use different thinking manner .
The culture shock is that international students need to overcome .
Students want to make new local friends , but cultural customs and taboos could be a problem to be noticed and adapt .
Leaving comfort zone , and everything is fresh .
As family and friends do not accompany , students must do a lot from basic living to future studies .
It is hard to live overseas alone , Therefore , making friends from the same country can assist one another .
Besides , attempting open mind .
To get along with international friends is a great way to expand horizon .
I was born in Danderyds hospital but lived in Stockholm , when I was four I moved to Danderyd .
I have a big brother , he 's 14 and goes on friberga as well his name is Ulric in 8f2 .
My favorite activity is football , it 's very funny to play it with all my friends , I also like to play floorball but it is n't as fun as football .
I also like to play video games I play with my friends , my favourite games is FIFA , NHL , GTAV and some other .
I have lived in stockholm , and in two houses in Danderyd but no more places .
I do n't know which is the best plays I have been in but New York was cool , but I actually like Fårö most is an island next to gotland and I have been there since I was 0 years .
We always rent a little cottages from a sheep farmer and now we know his family .
We always goes to the beach which is very nice and when it 's sunny and warm is better than the Mediterranean .
I do n't know what I 'm proud of but when I do a nice goal i gets proud because it 's feel good especially when it 's an important goal that maybe change the game .
I would like to be the best football player in the world , a Youtuber or take over a big company .
It often hard to go up in the morning , I always think just one more minute and then I fall asleep .
I do n't know if I can agree to that but I listened to them . :)
That I have been dancing for two years but I stopped because I did n't had time .
I would like to play a World Cup game and I also want to win champions league .
I do n't have a favourite movie , I like many but the movies I like the most is funny and action .
I do n't read so much books .
I like a lot of songs but I think it 's Let 's Do It Again with J Boog because I like the singer 's voice , it 's a soft song and it 's easy to sing to .
I also like Stolen Dance with Milky Chance because it 's a soft song .
I do n't only like soft music I also like pop music and house music .
I like to watch South Park it 's really funny and I have almost seen every 17 seasons I also like to watch youtube videos every day .
I like a lot of food but the most meat food is good and pizza .
My favourite restaurant most have good meat and be really nice .
The aim of this report is to describe and assess shops , which could be interesting for tourists .
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three matters : sovenirs , fashion and food .
It seems that there is not many places in city center where you can find souvenirs like postcards or books about the history of Katowice .
Fortunately , visitors would find all of that in the Tourist Information Ofiice and in shops on the outskirts .
The one , which is really worthy to see is " Kato - Sovenirs " .
They provide all sorts of funny local gadgets .
It 's the most popular sport all over the world .
My favorite international league is the English premiere league .
My advice to anyone who will start this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to loose fitness .
Also joining a team will be a great idea .
The environment is an important part of our life contributing in a positive way in our part of life without even concern about important parts for us to survive .
Humans can easily damage the environment just throw their waste without recycling or ruin the places where animals are living .
Deforest the woods can damage the cycle of nature .
Without forest ca n't be animals and the human being can disappear .
Some people do n't even care and just the do n't to earn money deforests the trees and sell to do furniture .
They even are not plant other trees .
I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment .
I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that was n't so rich .
Where I live now I noticed that have the opportunity to recycling the waste because it is a posh area .
In my opinion I think the government should take care of all area , even is a poor or rich area .
The pollution has a negative contribution to the environment .I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban area .
Birds from urban area is difficult for them to find a proper food instead .
Some people from area which I live they used to feed the birds but others they do n't even care .
To keep all the nature alive we must contribute everyone of us for future generation .
you can go by your car and at any time , but you ca n't by public transport .
you must not wait for your car but you must wait the public transport .
you do not pay any fees to travel by your car .
The aim today is to provide you with the description of a best friend .
Kike is my best friend , I met him when we were studying in the primary school , then we were six or seven years old .

To conclude I want to say that I 'm the godfather of his eldest son .
My wife is a very special person to me , I like her very mush .

I am writing to apply for your job offer .
I have already worked in summer camps in France and in Italy for children aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
I usually work in the kitchens so it does not bother me .
I can go all over the USA without any problems and I can help the staff to get around if needed since I have the driving license .
Therefore I think that I am the suitable person for the job .
yesterday night , i went to a restaurant with my family ..
l love the place , nice decoration of restaurant .
the waiter come to us and took the order .
my family ordered the dinner but l ordered specially pizza and coke because l love pizza .
we ate the food and enjoyed a lot .
l love that day spent with my family ..
l wish l have come at weekends with my family and friends .
I am living in the center of Spain , in a small city .
When I was child , my city was dirty because people were throwing their rubbish on the floor .
However , a few years ago the government has paid more attention to the environment to our country ; for example they made a lot of advertisement on televion , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that the rubbish is not good for our world .
Nowadays , we can see in all street a lot of bins and it is difficult to see rubbish on the floor because many people are cleaning the city .
In the future , we must do an effort to improve our environment because we will want to give the same world or if it is possible a better world than before to our sons .
No body can deny that transportation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can live without transportation as it 's the real meaning of connection between each other .
Cars are much convenient but this not mean that all other means of transportation are not important .
sometimes many people want to travel faraway along distances so they need planes .
other people prefer to travel by trains as it 's faster and more comfortable than cars .
Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable .
Now in every country we have lot of transportation means as planes , trains , undergrounds , cars , ships , and rockets .
public transportation is the mean reason to delivery people everywhere in a small time . in the past the had to use camels to travel which waste lot of time and tiredness .
Today our life is running by clock .
We need a vehicle to reach our work place .
If we use our public transport services .
we may be late to office / working place .
So we must use the personal vehicle .
Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us , but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease .
In Lublin is a beautiful castle .
It was built in twelfth century .
The castle 's look is in the Neo - Gothic style .
At the castle is Holy Trinty Chapel .
It is in a Gothic style .
It was built as a foundation of King Casimir the Great .
This tower is a precious monument of roman art and it is one of the oldest building in the Lublin .
It was a part of the borough castellan .
Castle also has a courtyard .
Now on the castle is a museum .
It to belong to the oldest and the biggest museums in eastern Poland .
This museum has a monuments of the superiority .
In my opinion it 's the one of the most fascinating place in Poland and the most wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everyone should visit this castle .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because it is always people laughing and talking about funny things .
The food in this restaurant is very good and has a subnormal size because it is much bigger than the useful food .
The famous dishe of this restaurant is a huge hamburgure
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the call meet there because like I said before the atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my opinion , public transport will become more and more important in the future . Travelling by car maybe is convenient , but it also brings air pollution and traffic jams .
If in a city there were only cars , the city would n't afford enough parking lots and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get their destinations .
On the other hand , cars need more gasoline than buses which let out CO2 and other kinds of waste gases into the air , leading to the serious air pollution .
So , what we need is to devote much more money and time to improve the public transport .
Public transport will have bright future ; on the contrary , travelling by car will vanish from our life .
My favorite way is Train .
Plane is most fastest in another way to travel .
However , plane is most dangerous way to travel .
Boat is the most cheapest in another way to travel .
However , boat is most slowest way to travel .
So , train is intermidiate way to tarvel .
I like fight , because I like to hit someone .
I start this sport when I was 11 years old , my dad let me go to box and I start that sport .
I started leading trener in the competition and I love this sport .
He is very good on this sport .
Today , the people use more cars , which leads to more cars on the street , traffic and pollution .
I think is better the idea that the people to use public transportation instead of using private cars or motorcycles
Firstly , people do not have to buy their own cars .
Accordingly , people do not have to spend lots of money on gas that they have to fill the tank .
Also , they do not have to find a place for parking as well .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to lower the congestion and air pollution by encourage people to use less private cars and turn to use more public transportation and other forms for transportation
It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called " dare to win " , I was with my brother , when we decided to call , The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time , and there is a different things for the winner .
A few minutes later we were listening ourselves in the programme , we were so nervous but it was exciting for us , our goal in the programme was get a free ticket for the most popular electronic party in the world .
Despite our nervous we did it well ! and our dream come true , yeah , we 'll be glowing in the dark !
As the secretary of the English Language club I am writing you this proposal to persuade you as to why it would benefit both the students , and the college if we would receive funding from you .
I am writing to aplaay for the job in the USA , published in an advertisement , last Monday .
I had recently finished my course of english in Cambridge , also I have a fresh and improve English .
In order to help organising on sports and evening activities , I am a young person of 12 years old .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities private cars are more attractive for most poeple .
I went to our new shopping centre last week at the downtown .
Actually I am very happy to tell you that we have a lot of new stores , including apple 's store .
Long ago we had no stores to buy products or whatever were our needs .
However from now one we can buying what we really need , on the other hand this shopping may help a lot of people get back working again .
A few weeks ago I went into apple 's store , so that I bought a new mobile phone , it is awesome because it has reliable tools which allows me doing my daily working .
Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying cabs .
But , the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons , first the time , if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car , also the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one , you will can not reach travel between continents with your car , a different reasson is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada , the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also , the economics is a factor to , because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do , it will be expensive that in public transportation .
In conclusion , for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future , however , they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy , one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel , and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now .
Dear Anne . Thank for your letter asking about my fmily and my Friends .

My brother lives in Barcelona with him girlfriend and he is very happy with her .
Also , I have very Friends .

Nowadays , It is possible to find any kind of Tvs programmes you want and yes , I consider that there is very much sport on television , but , not too much .
The way of life of people has began more and more stressful .
When somedoby to get at home he wants only relax in front of Television .
Besides this , Tvs companies have understood sports provides this relaxess moment , mainly for men .
Then It put on Televison more and more sports programmes .
In this view , I consider , though , there is lots of sports on Televison , they are not too much , because the people have looke for it .
In conclusion , I think that Tvs companies only want to sell their product and the people want to have their relax moment with the sports programmes .
We left from our city on Monday , and we arrived Carlos Paz on Thursday .

The album American Beauty/ American psycho is the sixth album released this year by the well - known American rock band Fall out boy that has a huge followers in several countries .
The album with eleven tracks that reach top one , won a gold and silver certifications for the best - selling in diverse countries as the USA , Canada and the UK .
This American band is known for their lyrics that hold something different from other the bands something close to a emocional statement .
Even in this albums that the band abandon their own root and add a bite of the pop genre in it .
I really recommend this album because of the lyrics and the sound because it catch you , almost like a great poetry .
I agree with the statement that people 's live will change dramatically in the next years , for previsible reasons that I will explain in following text .
Firstly , the biggest reason that people 's live will extremely change in the future is because of technology .
Technology is increasing in all the world .
New technology has improve systems in many areas society , mainly in Information Systems .
The Information trhough of the Internet , had beem each day more quickly and it is reaching all parts of the world .
Furthermore the things and process is in evolution .
Life of people is turning easiest and comfortable .
On industries , the big machines is making new products for our welfare .
Although , the advancement of technology , besides than bring advantages for everyone , it 's also will cause disadvantages , such as unemployment because machines will make the same or work better than humans .
that 's why I agree that people 's live will change dramatically in the next 50 years .

Nowadays , cost to buy a car that can take the whole family is not expensive anymore .
Car is not an expensive thing to have anymore .
As we know , the privilege having a travel by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We could stop in everywhere we want to stop .
We could visit every places with no limitation time .
If there was someone who asked me " What is your favorite sport ? and why are you enjoy it ? " I would tell that my favorite sport is soccer and it could let me know how important the team work is and I could always feel that there was a kind of power , like someone putting me into the water from the high place , to push me running and kicking the ball .
I had to say that feeling was really awesome .
It made me feel like that happiness is running through out my body .
I will suggest people who want to starting this sport , first you must find five to six friends to make a team , and then look for other friends to make another team , so that you can fight with other to get the score .
second , all you have to do is warm your body , if you do n't warm it before the race you might hurt yourself .
Third all you can do is play for fun with your friends .
what is it the best ?
Public transport , our cars or natural transport as a bike .
My techer said that public transport has not future in our society , because travelling by car si so much more adecuate , never the less I am disagree with her opinion because if we use public tranposrt we will pollute less .
Without travelling people would be very bored , life would be very monotunes .
So , in the future we will dispense of types of transportation .
In these days , we use cars to travel between countries .
People ca n't dispense of cars these days .
Families ca n't dispense of cars .
We should be careful from careless drivers .

We stayed in three different hotels and one day , we went also to the sea in Giardini Naxos .
The best thing I saw was the Valley of the temples , because there were a lot of ancient temples and monuments and ruines and they were really beautifuland also the panorama was amazing !

on the world recorded a lot of cases where the ufo was seen .
ufo story started already in antiquity .
on the walls of caves are sketches and paintings which show strange creatures and flying sauceres .
universe is colossaling and still we are knowing little about it .
maybe we do n't be alone and ufo exist ?
in addition more and more scientists agree with alien really exist
I am person that like going to do exercise , for this reason I like practise some sports , but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer .
I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity , because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules .
This kind of rules are very important , in my opinion , because when you do an activity and comply with the rules you are being a better person .

Our Future 's Lives :
The past already happened , we can not change it .
The future we do not know what 's coming .
But the present we live it , we live the moment and benefit from it at the maximum .
If you ask someone about the future , answers will be different but all will be around two main topics , Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one .
As far as I am concerned .
I do believe that people 's lives in the future will change toward the bad .
No because I am pessimist but due to several factors and condition allow me to divulgue my opinion .
Firstly , we are living in unstable world .
It is true that every day we have new innovation which help people and make their life more easier .
But from life 's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life .
Human are looking for a power and they are applying forest law , The stongest beat the weakest .
There are a categorisation of countries , there are developed countries , emerged one and on the way of development countries .
whare the critria of this ranking ? and ...
These questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for convenient answer .
Hence , The above indicates details support the idea that there will be a change in people 's lives but in negative side .
In addition , A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect , this effect exist even in people 's lives or themselves .
And unfortunately this bad impact exist almost in all lives filed .
Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and improve from diseases but have another hidden effect .
This effect always leaves people suffering later after the usage .
Therefore , The afformentioned information above show that our future can be worse than our present .
To summarize , People 's life knows a fast change and development , but generally this evolution affecting people .
Should live in stabele and peaceful world .
We must stop all wars , conflict and impose human beings principls and values .
It is specialized in barbecue , beers and wines .
The infrastructure of the place is quite wide and in the front side you can see a huge welcome sign .
The service provided by the restaurant is exceptional for example , the waiting time is very short .
And it is very well ordered .
In terms of food quality the level is extraordinary , they are well known for their roast meat .
Trains are going to be used evermore .
There is a hotly debated issue of that whether student should take at least one year to work or travel before they go to university .
And the topic of people 's view can be approached from different angles due to its complexity .
Some people prefer this " gap year " theory while others seem to prefer disagree .
After careful considering this issue , I also develop my own points of view .
I favor the former statement , that is , I think student should have a gap year before they go to university , based on n1 , n2 .
I agree with you about the future for public transport .
Every day , the combustible that we get to our cars is more expensive than use the public transport .
Nowadays , people use their cars to move for work , for holidays ...... but if the petroleo were cheaper , they could travelled very much .
It could be a good idea if the taxes were cheaper than the taxes of other things such a tobacco , alcohol ....
what do you think about that ?
although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages , by using public transport you 're saving effort when driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
I saw you uploading the cat into the glass bottle in Facebook .
I want to give you a few words .
Maybe you just think it 's fun but it 's been a good cause for your cat because of you 're joking .
If you want to raise animals , you must take care of it , love it and treat it like a family .
Although it is not human , they also have feelings .
You raise it once , it would regard you as the owner .
You are only relying on it .
I hope you will decide to cats do not let it hurt in future .
Furthermore , you abuse cat has violated not only the ethics but also the law .
I hope you can take down photos of being abused the cat and you can really reflect . Do n't repeat the same mistakes .
To keep the cat is not a simple matter which need to real love and good care .
So you decided to keep the cat must be the best , you can spend more time with the cat .
At any time to pay attention to the cat has not been sick .
The holiday you can go for a walk with a cat .
It is not difficult to do the thing .

There is no future for public transport , that is true , but I think that people are very comfortable and do n't think about the environment .
On the other hand , the public transport is the cheapest way to travel , although people do n't think of that aspect .
Secondly , you can drive your car everywhere , It does n't matter what time it is or where you would like to go . Travelling by car is much more convenient and comfortable than travelling by bus , by subway or by train .
In your car you can put inside all bags that you want to take .
These aspects or advantages are that I can say about this topic .

In my opinion , in future people do n't be used public transport .
It will be not tredy because everybody will have his own car .
These cars will be used alternative energy , for example energy of the Sun .
The modern science try to find new , more economic sources by energy .

Peter has been thinking about this secret party for months since the time he knew his mother was healed .
He was taking care of her so that he was prevented from going to university .
He had to refuse to all his dreams suddenly .
However , the destiny has given him another chance to follow them .
She felt blessed as she was given such a perfect son .
It is said to happen once in life .
Peter has been kissed by her mum before , but this time was quite different .
Environment is the combination of air , earth , water forest and all these are interlinked with each other .
Most importantly , all species of animals and human being are the part of this ecosystem .
Human is the most wise and intelligent from all of these .
However , he is mainly responsible for disturbing this ecosystem with various activities .
Lets talk about one of them , that is ' cleanliness ' Nowadays , we all know that we are spreading the garbage near our houses and offices .
This may be due to people are not aware about consequences of this bad habit- spreading the rubbish .
But , in these days , with education , people are becoming more sensible and responsible towards the environment .
In the same line , dwellers of my village are doing lots of work to make their area clean and hygiene .
They collect house hold waste in a dustbin and put off with proper standard procedure .
They collect and segregate the rubbish in separate containers .
For example , they collect plastic waste in yellow dustbin while , liquid and solid , degradable waste in red container .
This makes easy and convenient to identify the waste types .
To conclude , I would like to say that nowadays people are becoming more aware and conscious towards environment through education .
Today in my class there was a discussion on television education .
Television is an object that help people to know the news in real time .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause an dipendence , cartoons and " stupid " program can damage mostly young people .
Today there are many children that have the dipendence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various child tv programs , while once our parents preferred hang out with your friends .
Television can be a useful strument if it is used with caution , accordingly I recommend use less it for prevent damage to the mental level .
In order to help reduce contamination I take acction from the three " R".reduce , reuse and recycle as so I am more and more ecofriendly .
I reduce use of innecesary power at home , in other words , I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower ; I hit only neccesary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all thing reusable , for example , plastic bottle as a plant pot ; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring .
Recycling is another way to be ecologist .
Today , we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin , which will be use it by specialized factory in another item .
As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment .

Hï Jo ,
In my opinion , it is a good idea about you spend some time travelling because you will have an opportunity to think about your future but in my city because of the crisis there is very little work for everyone .
Here , there are monuments , churches or famous people and perhaps to you in the future you would like to become a history teacher .
Although now that the holidays are coming you need people to help and ride the amusement park or the lights of the fair .
If you come to Linares could amuse you and if you come forward to work can do it
You have to come here because Holy Week in Linares is nice and the show is spectacular and if you want to have fun and I like the bulls
But if you want to decide , I 'll intend to help you .
On the other hand , music is the best for relaxing and enjoy .
You can devote more time to do both .
If I were you , I would go running at the morning and I would go to music classes after lunch .
I hope this help you and you will take the best decision .
I agree this affirmation because the public transport is more expensive than car , is slow and is less economic .
the car is less expensive , more confortable , more fast and more security .
every time the car is more utilized and more economic .
in my opinion the car more advantageous than car and the car is more useful
To my mind this mind not right .
First of all travelling by car is very expensive .
For example travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plain is faser .
Secondly it 's not comfortable.becouse you every day drives instead of relaxing and enjoy the enviroment
It is said that people prefer going by bus to a close place , but some of then do n't think the same .
The public transport has plenty of advantages .
Some people ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay for oil , as it is constantly rising , so using a public transport is an economic way to travel .
On the other hand it helps to reduce the polution made by cars , ..
Besides , it will be always useful for people ca n't drive .
The reason is they are tired of using public transport and they would get earlier to everywhere .
In the future , cars would be so cheap than everyone will have one , thus , it will take up the end of the public transport .
To sum up , I would say that people will use more and more public transport , as the oil is getting expensive .
The picture illustrate the progrocess of making notes .
There includes some most important steps .
It is the first step that costs troublesome , some things must be included the considerations , such as background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments .
Printing is the next step , .Usually , sheets of bank notes printed , because there are some special require for the printing , solour of both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The last step is the inspertion , sheete manually inspected .
The inspection always have three results , the good quality sheets , the bad sheet or the partially damaged sheets .
If the print sheets has good quality , they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal , the destroyed will be secure .

The television is one of the most important AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles , for instance , education , movies , songs , sports , news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it 's entertained channels , and the television can educate you through it 's educational channels .
At this time and age , most of the people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation .
It is also make convenient for people who are rushing time to work , meeting and so on .
However , I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn .
Public transport is cheap and friendly for environment .
firstly , the fare of public transport is cheaper compared with buying a new car .
The person that do not have to save large amount of money to buy the car .
They can use the money in more useful or meaningful way such as investment property .
The fare of public transport is less than own vehicle when compared fare of bus to fulfill whole tank of oil .
Some more they are needed to pay a parking fee for parking .
Because of everybody has to leave for another place through their own car and carbon dioxide released from the car .
The public transport is a way to reduce the air pollution because it can carry more than a dozen times the people in a time and reduce their own vehicle .
Lastly , public transport that are always blamed by the people that are slowly and trouble than own vehicle .
Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough .
In conclusion , public transport is needed for everybody in a necessary time .
It always can make us save the money and make the environment more nature and fresh .
Nowadays , the space for countries enlarges , instead of which , the area for farmland , forests and wetland is getting smaller .
This kind of situation brings all kinds of problems to mankind and animals .
The large - scale building projects took the space which should belong to the animals .
Some kinds of animals would move to the urban area , steal the food from us and sleep on the streets or in the underground .
However , most of them might be arrested .only a little number of them might be adopted by those friendly human .
On the other hand , the expansion of city increase pollution of all kinds of garbage . The air pollution is much more serious now , and watching the blue sky is almost impossible in some big cities .
Although the medical skills get stronger , the percentage of people who get cancer is still improving .
In conclusion , the large - scale building projects take the living resource from animals , increase the possibility of getting cancer and so on .
Only if the government develop more technical property , pay more attention to the environment protection , such as build more trees and grass in the cities , and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us .
For me , my family members are not my best friends although I wish they are .
If they are your best fiends they will guide you and help you to be to be the best of you , they wo n't hurt you or turn their back on you .
But on the other hand you maybe punished or they may yell at you when you do something wrong .
So it is not always a good thing , unless they are open - minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentil way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes .

It is a veri quiet place , because of its location , in the middle of the forest , only a few people know how to get there .
You can only arrive at ' A Fervenza ' walking or riding a bike , but it is impossible to get there by other ways .
It is an invledible forest place , the ground is full of low grass and there is a little river where you can swim , is is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
That is all I can tell you about this place . I hope tath my answer will help you with your project .

I got one sister that named Ingrid and she is 8 years old .

The accomplishment I am the most proudest of was when I did four goals in a soccer game .

Three words that I can describe myself with is :

she thought he was so bored , but she did n't want to be alone.she did n't know how to live on ther own and Emily was utterly frightened to be alone .
The purpose of this report is that people would become more aware of the significance of taking care of the environment in order to erradicate this issue which is having serious consequence nowadays .
Acid rains or global warming are issues which have been brought about the careless people .
By one hand , if we avoid being the pollution in ours cities , we could have a lifestyle more healthier than in the past .
On the other hand , we help to improve and clear up the environment if we throw away the rubbish in the green points of the town .
MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT
The council is carrying out a project in order to erradicate the rubbish in my town .
This project is focused on separating the rubbish in each green points of the city and also they have to maintain their neighbourhood as clear as are possible .
To sum up , taking care about the environment should be an obligated task for us .
The main reason for this is , provided that we bear in our minds that we must collaborate with all arounds , we will maintain the world on our hands .
I reply to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps , have looked after children aged 5 - 10 and it was a fantastic experience , worked at school in north Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot about children , think that i 'm a suitable person for the job because use to be an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking , love working with children and like organising several types of activities , I 'm not very good cooking but i can learn very fast .
Think that can do a fantastic job .
To combat the distriction of enviornment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constricated .
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it .
There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals .
For instance , people need to many places to build the modern society , so they fall down lots of trees , burnning many glasses .
Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation become more prefect , and the people'life become more convenient .
Althought this change lend the life of people efficient , the problem should not be ignored .
It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions , in today 's world , lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission , they are destroyed the forest , farmland and wetland , charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas , it lead to a serious enviorment problem .
So the government should oversee this companies , and if companies do not obey the rules or laws , it will be fined and closed .
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expesnes we encounter .
The other benefit if taking public transport is less people are taking cars reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environemnt .
Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life .
Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life .
People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this .
Children has to be protected before and after life , it is why abortion has to be stop
In my opinion , I believe the public transport will have big role in the future due several reasons :
1- Inflation in population , the roads will not bear or endure huge numbers of cars .
2- I think on the future and transport and roads will be more organizing more than these days .
3- In the future people will concern more about energy , so transport will be more useful .
4- Transport more economical from independent cars .
5- Many people ca n't drive like children and old people .
6- Not everyone has the ability to buy a car .
Cause all these reasons I believe the transport will have big future .
Next , from 3rd Qtr to 4th Qtr the sales remained steady in $ 850 .
The last sales of the last year was $ 850 .
karate is one of the best sports i have ever enjoyed in my life .One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it 's means of tamming the mind and the body .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also , it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient .
They should emerse themselves in daily exercises as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active .for instance , it 's adviced to eat great amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
My favorite sport are football baskeball Formula One and Tennis .
I started to play football when I had four years .
He arrives to Real Madrid 5 year ago and he is the best player of the team .
I watch two match at the weekend of the Spanish league or NBA .
I started to watch Formula One for my father these is his favourite sport .
Tennis is the favourite sport of my brother .
That is one of my favorite sports
How is going ?
What 's a big surprise , you are married .
I 'm very pleased to your invite .
Now I 'm thinking about the present , what do you like ?
I look forward to hear from you .
sports is very much beneficial for our health .
i would like to play football because it 's too much exciting game . in proportion to length it takes only 90 minutes . whenever i got the opportunity i played football .
Driving car while listening to music is much more fun for most of people so maybe that 's why mostly love to drive than taking public transport .
In contrary some guys hate getting caught in traffic jam so prefer public transport;some other reasons may be rising gas price , car crashes or hating driving !
As a result I thought both driving and public transport have their roles and we need to take each in the right situation .
I have two reasons why I think so .
First , there are many kinds of types which train has .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which measns burrett train is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " which has many beds in train and we can sleep comfortabully in train .
Thus , not only to ride but also to watch train is very interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable conpared to plane .
Recently although there are many LCC careers we can choice , it is still expensive to travel by plane .
TTravelling by train is cheep and getting chicket is easy for us in our country .
And terolism is scare also .
The plane which travel from Egypt to Russia was explosed by terolist in last month .
Compared to plane , train is relatively safe because it can move only on the land .
These reasons are why I think traveling by train is favourable .
What did you do yestreday ?
I prefer another kind of films than comedy , but yesterday there were n't any good film at the cinema .
what kind of films do you like ?
I like thriller and the action films because they have never been boring .
Do you prefer to watch films at home or go to the cinema ?
I prefer to watch films at the cinema because there are n't any distractions or noises and the quality of films are better .
There are several efforts that we can contribute in order to save the environment .
We start little by little to help it .
First of all , I want to emphasize on reducing the usage of plastics .
It 's the basic things and a habit that we can start easily from our own .
Plastics are non - biodegradable which degrade after 1000 years .
Non - biodegradable plastics could actually piles up the landfill and cause the land use in our earth to be occupied .
Besides , it destroys the marine ecosystem in such a way that the seabird or fish are fed on plastic .
This cause their reproduction system to be destroyed .
Hence , we should bring our own recycle bag or basket every time we go for shopping and resist temptation to get plastic from them .
Besides , we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emission into the environment .
If the distance to destination is short , we could replace driving by walking or cycling .
That 's the descent way in reducing the adverse environmental impact and we are able to protect our Earth
Since GM crops technology started to be implemented it have implied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
This technique makes the weed control easier resulting in cost savings and yield gains , so that increase global production of crops such as corn , cotton , canola and soybeans .
he said kindly:"I buy you a present , open it , Tom "
Tom opened the big bag , Oh!This is a big surprise , there was a football in it , which he always wanted to buy
there were some words goal!keep doing ! keep looking!said her mom , Look !
there was also a cup in it , It said"don't give up your dream , keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on "
Tom love it , " thanks mom , thanks dad!"Today is the best day of my life , thank you ! "
" You deserve them , Tom ! you work hard all the time this year "
My name is Anna , i one of many new students at Ton Duv Thang university .
I 'm nineteen years old and from city but i living at domitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
I loves Ton Duc Thang university so much .
I likes the friendly students and helpful teachers .
I enjoys reading book , cooking , playing with dog and singing .
Moreover , i 'm loves music , i 'm often listen to pop music , R and B , and little Rap .
These days people care about privacy and hence a personal car not only provides privacy but also convenience .
Hence , the new luxury cars are getting cheaper and powerful .
The speed of life has been fastened , people do n't have time to wait for a taxi or in the bus stop to get their work done , they want their work done in the blink of an eye .
So the need for bus has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time consuming .
Even kids started to learn driving at fifteen and most of the parents gift cars in their sixteenth birthday .
We can seen determine the future of transportation by differentiating the numbers of cars and buses .
Students have started to use their own cars than the bus .
So I think the future of public transportation is in darkness .
Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid .
Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game .
The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat .
So , I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling .
Its very simple and wonderful sport .
If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body .
In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord .
The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time .
I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I ca n't take effort toward this .
So , if are going to play this sport do notice that there are some rules and be sure that you have all safety stuffs with you . Please do n't forget to take pleasure of batting first .
I hope you are going to play the best game on your part .
MY friend was travelling there , she was talking to me about it so much .
Indian people make an amazing food , but it 's so spicy .Indian people dance in amazing way .
One day it was my dream to go there .
I 'm writing to you to tell you that I will go to your home next month , I hope that you stay at home because I need your help , I will bought a present for Mary and I do not know what is her favourite coluor ,
When I will stay with you I would like to go to a Spanish restaurant , Will you ?
You are my best friend since 1984 , When I was born near to your house .
Now I have lived in Badajoz for ten years , We moved here to go to the beach every day , I like the beach and the sun , especially in summer When the sun is in the sky .
I like dance and sing too , I 'm very happy singing in the beach , especially if you stay with me .
Yes , I think it also can educate .
As times go by , technology is rapidly improving .
More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions , smartphones and so on .
Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge .
For instance , there are numerous program that we can choose .
It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program , when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day .
Television provides educated varieties of channels as well .
We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves .
Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live .
I think after 50 years many things will change . we will learn in our homes .
we won , t have schools .
we will do home works at home and send it to the teachers .
they will correct our tasks and send it again to us .
There wo n't be super markets .
It wo n't be a post office because we can send any thing by the Internet .All jobs will be on Internet .
They will serve us instead of human servant .
There will be any poor in the streets .
we will live happily .
I hope that the future will live peacefully and happily .
Hi , I am Amy . I would like to spend two months studying in English , two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children .
The most important of all , I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip .
As long as you can go with me just let me know .
your friend Amy
I usually run in the morning , when my roommates are still sleeping , I get up and run in the playground .
When I am running , all preesure I undertook has gone .
I am fill with hope .
I started running because I endured neck pain and my left leg is not comfortable when I sat all day .
Furthermore , I want reduce my weight as well .
I bought shoes , clothes and GPS watch , I told myself : now it is a challenge , I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful , I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3 km , but things becomes better and better , and now I could run 10 km .
If you want to start running , firstly , you need a comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , make a plan , like how long should I run today , remember , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't make a goal that you ca n't reach , or you will lose your confidence soon .
the most important thing is your willpower .
First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house , you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason ?
Of course the answer is no!Everyone knows that " Earth is our home."It is bigger than a house .
We have Eather first than people thanour house .
Eather is our home , we all have to protect it .
But now people are distroy it .
Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing .
Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do ?
Forest brings us fresh air bu8 t if there is no trees , what will happen ?
We ca n't breave we will die , too !
So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland , forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world , our homestar !
The lecture desagree with the paragraph , suggesting that the mention test developed by Alan Turing do not respond the mainly question : Can the computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " that propose a challange to prove that the Turing 's test was not conclusive , than he create a paradox .
He selected people to into in a chinese room , there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols , the american was a diferente behavior , they did not understand what was in the computer screen .
Different from the original test mention on the text , that all the participants were american and native speakers from that language , it was really easy to understand what was in the computer screen .
Second , the text support that the computers were evaluated by the own people that submited the test .
For example , for the young people in College the studies are more important , as well as books , seminars , travelling , etc .
Nowadays , Public Transport has become a very important way to go to work , to travel to other cities , or to simply go to visit a friend to the other side of the city .
I agree , for many people travelling by car is much more convenient , however , in my opinion , there is still a long future for public transport .
I am happy to know about you .
Your plan sound great and I will be pleased to spend a few days with you and your family .
My grandmother is going to visit me in July so I would prefer suit you in August .
My smaller sister wants to go to the beach so that if she is not a problem she could come with us .
However she can stay at home .
I think it is more fun sleep together in your apartment . We could tell terror stories to each other at night , before sleep .
I really like spend time on the beach but there are a lot of time so we could go to the swimming - pool if your parents say yes .
Too we could go to the bar to drink some juice or to go to eat an ice - cream .
Do not forget to write soon
Science , I just remember I always liked a car race , but one of my frevourite is a Formula 1 .
I like cars , and I like high speed that is why I love a Formula 1 races .
Formula 1 seson starts at erly spring and ends with a late autumn .
I try to watch every race every fournight and training a day before the race .
I like so much Ricki Rikonen , he is a ferrari team driver .
Ricki , is not the fastes driver on the track , but he drive very safety .
Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word , but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac , how they were in the past .
If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound , I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life .
Formula 1 it is also dangerous sport , the driver are exposed to the risk of accident at high speed .
I wish Good lack to all Formula driver !
Michael is one of the most important economist in the world , he wrote a lot of book about economy and finance in the USA and Europe .
He has decided to do a short essay about capital market abuse whereby he considered to travel to Italy and pick up some financial data from Italian central bank .
The key idea of this essay is the following : Italy in time of Berlusconi was almost entered bankruptcy however Michael is trying to avoid the Italian economy condition simply because he likes Berlusconi too much .
he received a lot of critics simply because many economists and econometricians in the world do not trust the source that he was used in his essay moreover they thought that he received money from Italian government .
After two years that his essay was released , he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover , Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake

It is very easy to spend hours getting entertained by television .
However , it is more difficult to educate .
What 's more there are countries around the world that lack teachers to go to remote areas to teach , that rely on television to teach .
oh no ! !
How could I do this mistake ! !
These were my first feeling when I did the mistake .
Like every one , I was a normal person learning & improving day by day little by little from mistakes .
I am writing to suggest a few ways what our college can do for the environment .
In order to reduce energy consumption should be made so that as much as possible lectures takes place in the day time .
This would reduce energy needed for the light sources .
In order to improve the sorting , there should be a litter bins for each mentioned substances in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the student and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the student should be taught lectures about the environment .
I hope I find the answers to your question in my letter .
Seoul , in Korea , has many places to visit which places people want to visit .
I will introduce some good places to visit .
firstly , people who prefer youth culture , I recommend Hongdae .
Hongdae is most appropriate to feel free and vibrant local area in seoul .
there are a lot of club , pub and bar , cafe , karaoke and has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .
Hongdae has many kinds of places thus , but you will be concerned about drunk people when the late at night .
At the late night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around on the street with in drunken condition themselves .
So you need to be careful that kind of people .
and then , let me tell you another place ' Duksu palace '
. you can experience 19 century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional custom .
there was the place of the Chosun imperials queen .
The palace is in the middle of the city , therefore , you may feel different mood between 19 century and this day .
And also , there is gift shop and cafe .
I hope to enjoy your trip in Seoul till you left our contury .
Thank you for your reading .

In conclusion , before read the article I have never realized the importance of using drama in an English class .
For sure I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives to students the opportunity of not just learn something in the classroom , more than that , is the opportunity that they use their knowledge in the pedagogical and social life .
With reference to recent advertisement about ' USA CAMPAMENT SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position for the job in the campament .

I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history , he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .
I would like to visit is Germany .
You can think ' why this ? '
It 's very simply .
In the school I study German and I like the language .
I think is a strong , maybe a bit hard to hear , but beautiful at the end .
Added to what I know , make it attractive .
To this , we have to join the food and drinks ( who do n't think this ? ) .
Except estrange cases , who do n't like to prove the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurt sausages in the place where was invented ?

Family are the members that they never wo n't leave you alone , they give you love and happiness , they make your day!They are our best friends and family .
First of all , friends are important for us , we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems .
But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you ca n't always based on them!For example , they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away .
But family never let you go or family never go away from you !

Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children , to feed them , to love them !
In conclusion , Members of your family an important role in your life !
In the last years was improved the public transport system .
In the last edition of Pur Plus occurred an important discussion about the next plan of cities .
It presented a politician , an economist and two envirementalists .
They were talking about the problems of the public transport system and the results of new habits in this sector .
These people , those live in a city , do not take her own car or have not one .
This is a new age , which we live .
So will follow problems of these habits .
This makes me ponder , weather is a future of the old public transport system or should make a new system .
One argument of these topic , that more and more people live in cities .
There going to following some problems .
One of these are the jams .
Everybody own a car and nobody rent a car .
So will following more jams , if we do not change our habits .
The results , which will follow , will be the pollution of the environment .
There should be a ban of cars .
So we will stop the jam and so the problems of environmental .
But now we need more buses or another faster public transport systems .
But we should not forget , that these options do not alloy the environment .
Have you drank under the legal drinking age in this past month ?
If yes , then you are one in the other 8.7 billion who have also drank under the legal drinking age . You may think that drinking underage will not do too much harm , but it can .
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because the teen could get into trouble with the law , the teen could cause harm themselves and others and can have a higher risk of alcohol dependancy later in there lives .
transport at Sudan is so expensive we suffer from the less and expensive transport here .
there are many kind of transport such as buses train and small cars called amgad an also taxi
This is an interested question becaus I beleive that my family is my best friends but at the same time they are not my friends .
My family is my best friends because they realy takes care off me when I needed them to .
They looks over me and help me when I am in troubles .
THis is important because it is important to have somebody to rely of .
But my family is not my best friends because you chose you friends but you do not chosen you family .
The two maps show the changes which had taken place in the town of Shipsmouth between 1995 and 2010 .
Generally it can be seen that the city became more modern in 2010 than it before .
first of all , in 1995 shipsmouth was green residential city with two forests .
the two green area in the north - west and south - east concern had been replaced by apartment blocks and an airport .
No one can deny how much sport is very important to our life health .
my favourite sport is squash .
I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also , but he started it when he was more greater than me , He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age , I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink , as much exercise you will find down the road .
I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which gives stretched and healthy body , in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age .
squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports
SWIMMING THE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD
I have praticed swimming for 3 years , I am a good swimmer and I have competed in differents tournament of swimming .
The swimming is my favorite sport because in this sport I train all my body , is very relaxing and is the best sport in the world .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because He was the best swimmer in the world and I hope that He returns to olyimpic games at Rio de Janeiro in 2016 .
I need pratice for be the best swimmer in the world than Michael Phelps .
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always pratice this style because I want to improve .
I want to compete in United States in the most important tournament , in this competition participate the best swimmers of the world .
Nowadays it is easier to use the car instead of public transport .
Althouth public transport is cheep and more enviermental , they are not so flexble or comfortable as the car .
Exept for the big cities the public transport is not an easy way to move trohout the city , that means that in the future even more people will stop using it .
In these diagrams below , the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
The first step , the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions , like background color , artwork and security issues , After it was prepared , skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step .
Then , sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet , which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink .
After printing well , these sheets would be manually inspected closely .
It was the most important step during the whole processing .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded .
Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently , would be destroyed securely .
This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps .
The sport is one of the best forms to be healthy and make some exercise .
The most healthy sports are swimming , playing basketball , playing football or running but I prefer to play tennis .
My favourite sport is playing tennis .
I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends .
I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays .
For new tennis players I recommend to know how to hold the racket , the position to hit the ball and how to put your feet .
They will have to concentrate on game and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing about wheather or not we agree to the common enourmous payed salaries of fooball Players .
For me , as a passionated Soccer Player , it is a good Point to consider .
I recommand to the Clubs , be warned .
For him , as one of the top sheld payed Players of european leagues , it is no big deal to buy a Mercedes Benz .
He does not Need another one , but he likes the colour .
This way of thining he also Shows in game time .
He is not chasing after the ball , is not fighting enough to Keep it In the case he would really Need the Money , he would behave totally different .
What influences does this salaries have on the Clubs is quite simple .
They sell the tricots for 20 Euros more per Piece than last season .
By this aciton a Ronaldo or messie can be payed and it is possible to buy the best Team fo the league , like Bayern Munich is doing at the Moment .
For them it is not possible anymore to rule for their Teams at any home game .
The tickets are to expensive .
The Anger will spoil over someday .
This makes Football or Soccer ever more equisite to a certain Group of fans - Hooligans .
As a result of These Action , it is an uncertain way to go for the Clubs .
If it stays on a certain Lever , no fan will complain about higher Prices .
But if the Prices will be to high , no onw would visit the games anymore .
In my home country , there are many different kinds of business culture and custom .
For example , restaurant business and technology industry is totally different in Taiwan .
In these 10 years , Taiwanese have become enjoy our life , so many people like to drink coffee or have an afternoon tea .
That is why many business men want to win in this competition , so they created so many bargain activities , like if you check into places , you will buy one get one free .
Apparently , restaurant business is creative and marketing - orientation in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are two different type of company in the technology industry .
One is original equipment manufacturer , like Foxconn , workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executive in Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung .
Although they produce high quality products they receive a little money and have high pressure in work .
The other one is original brand manufacturer , like htc , they produce a lot of new smartphones and sell it .
In three to four years ago , htc makes so much money in the Europe , Taiwan and Japan .
The company likes to produce new products and use high salary to hire great talents .
So htc became more energetic and bold in making innovation .
In Taiwan , many young people want to enter htc .
Finally , Taiwan still suffers economic slump , but we have so many businesses likes to innovate , market their product , customers likes to buy it .
I think Taiwan will be recovery in the near future .
One evening , it was a blistering hot day that I still should attended , one of my friends , a wedding ceremony .
I was dressed in nice suit , going to this party .
I did n't want to chat with them first .
Consequently , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking for , my friend , a bride .
I wanted to know how beautiful the woman was .
As soon as the bride appeared in front of us , most people kept silent abruptly .
I maintain a good - looking face , keeping fit .
I prefer having a nice gorgeous girl live with me to living alone .
Accordingly , I drifted to the party , going home alone .
However , I was too dizzy to go straight so that I took a ride .
The driver set me to a place where he know .
When I woke up , not doing know why I stayed the police office .
Dear Mrs Kate Asbhy ,
I 'm Patricia Agüero , I have seen the advertisement for work in your cafe and I 'm very interested , because I need work to pay my study .
First I think that this job is perfect for me because I have travelled around the world and I know a lot of kinds of food , in fact in my last trip to Japan I learned to cook shushi .
In addition I love dealing with people , I 'm very sociable .
On the other hand I 'm used to work long hours as a matter of fact in holidays I had worked in many restaurants .
I hope your answer soon .
one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake .
he forgot the key inside the home !
what should he do ?
hw went to his father in the company and get the another copy of the house key .
when he get back to the home it was late and the metting was canceled
But not so many people have a driver license .
The public transport can connect people .
You can meet every kind of people .
It 's some kind of socializing .
The public transport is cheaper than the car .
hello , my name is victor and I am going to talk to you about myself .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience , I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey , so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience in this .
I have other qualities like , cooking like super chef or even better than that , I am the person more organizated in this country , and I love to work with children because it is a form to teach everything you know to other people and help to improve like person .
I always do exercise , in the morning I like to running on the beach , at the evening I like to go to the gym and at night I love to swim in my own swimming pool .
so in conclusion , I think that if you contract you , you will get an axcellent people and an excellent worker
I think it is true that the public transport there is not future , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion the public trasnport is more expensive and it is less comfortable that the car , because the car is faster that the public transport .
The public transport do stop more time that the car , this transport go direct to its destination .
Today the people use the application " blah blah car " .
it is an application that the people use for save gas and money .
I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train , the bus , underground , etc .
The problem that I saw with this , It is that in the future will be more pollution , because there will be many cars .
Online Lerning
Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do nt have to carry so much paper with you , also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs . maybe your more confortable on your Smartphone then with papers .
Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer , if you do nt have any listening things in the app you do nt lern how to pronounce the words . in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i do nt think its the best if we use them to lern as well .
For words i think its perfect but all the grammer and talking i think you need a teacher .
I love Grey 's Anatomy , this is supposed to be a medical drama , but I am sure this show has been beloved because of the soap opera drama parts .
Therefore , I would like to highly state that Grey 's Anatomy is my favorite soap opera .
The show seems difficult , the characters always have to face the situations which is uneasy to solve , but practically , this show is a soap opera in hospital .
I used to think I never liked soap opera , because it was boring , out of date and unworthy to watch , but this was just prejudice .
My mother also like this show .
It shows you movies , news and the new products .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example sfter School .
So at a Special time is a special advertisement for this age group .
Advertisement is important for the economy .
Exept some good movies they also show a lot of rubbish .
Or sometimes you see during the day horror movies which should not be .
Who wants that their child sees this ?
Of course you can make a child lock on the TV but when you look hard enough for some you will find any .
I would say if you know how and when to use a TV it is good but specially for young people who think it is a good entertainment to watch the whole day .
The TV people know what to play that the children get addicted to the TV .
Attitude about schools in Colombia and Australia .
The attitude of Colombians about the educations system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
In the same way Australians have a different attitude about their education system .
However the attitude of the Colombian and Australian people is different in many ways .
In Colombian some people have a high attitude about education but there are some others that have a very low attitude .
This is because in Colombia there are a lot of social - economic levels which make people to have a different and divided attitude toward education .
Similarly , Australians have a different attitude about the education system .
This is depending on the believes and the cultures of the people .
This attitude is more based on the backgrounds of the people rather than the system itself .
Today I am very exciting because on Sunday I will go to Bangkok .
I go with my older sister , daddy and mommy .
We enjoy so much .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building house , which accour for some debation .
Many would argue that its disadvantages have already dispersed advantages , and many others veto this view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both economy and cultural diversity , the need of the resource is increading , which used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significient symbol for the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of probems .
In the first place , the environment is destroyed , because there are some tresses and flowers before buliding the house .
What is worst , the room of the house where some animals lived before , so they lost their houses , which become the houses of people , nevertheless , the earth is not only belonged to the human .
Secondly , building more houses not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of the house is too expensive to buy for public person .
For example , some people who have lots of money living in shenzhen earn more money by buying low price and selling high price , although they have house to live .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by setting certain law .
In a word , the government may appeal in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only facus on personal profit .
Nowadays people usually use the car all the days , actually for most of the diary things ; despite the fact that there is small amount of people that travel in public transport .
The cars pollute big amounts of carbon dioxide , so that is the result of the grey skies of some cities like Madrid Beijing or New York are grey and this has to change .
Using the public transport is " healthier " than the car for the environment because inside the bus can travel twenty three humans and is only one vehicle , however it would be twenty cars .
Also people think that travel in cars is faster than in public transport and I agree with it because the bus or the underground is always stopping in the different stations , so in this way the car is better .
In my opinion , I will use the public transport , not always but more than the car although you travel slower because I want to save our planet , that the rising generations can live in good conditions .
I have been playing tennis since I was a teenager and for that reason tennis is my favourite sport .
The main reason by which I like playing tennis is because I can control the amount of exercise that I can do .
Tennis is not a coletive sport .
There are necessary just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but yourself .
Besides , you do not need a lot of people , as on football match for example , to play tennis .
Sometimes it is difficult to join so many fellows to practise a coletive sport .
Undercontrary , on a tennis match you need just one , does n't matter if man or woman .
The exception is in a match of double .
Even that you have to find only three more players in this case .
But , although all these advantages , the tennis player has to take care with some dangerous situations .
For example , never starts a match without a warm up because you can suffer serious muscular injury .
It happened with me once and was very unconfortably .
Another very commom risk is to fall on the square which can cause dangerous scratches .
In despite the risks , I recommend this sport for everyone who has a good physical condition .
Buy a good racket , wear a pair of good shoes , find someone to practise and start to enjoy .

I was the boy behind the curtain , I dealt with the sound of the concert due to my experience in professional music equipment .
I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked .
Pleasure to work at concerts is when I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate .
The experience is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert .
When they were together , they knew that his history was about to finish .
People surprised to know his relation was broken for so long .
Never nobody heard any discussion .
They always were so friendly , and so kind ... that was strange image that end But that was the sad reality .
Then had to decide with who would stay their cat .
They met with the layer .
They presented arguments to get the custody and the layer listened them very carefully to decide they can not have the cat .
The cat had to go to the animal residency and they had to pay the expenses .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake
There are the most bad mistake that he does in all your life ....
Her mom would kill him !
But first , I will tell you all the story since the beginning .
Michael was a boy very intelligent .
He was the best student in her class .
Mia that was her name .
She always asks to Michael to never disrespect when people are at the door and always be polite .
Mia could n't accept when some behave badly .
And Michael said every time that he never will do that .
But , one day day , Mia think that she could do a test .
She would get dressed as an old woman .
Then she put her cover of an old woman and took her way home .
Getting there , she knocked on the door .... Michael open the door and Mia ask if he has a cup of water to give him and he says way he would give a cup of water to an old people .
In this moment , Mia took away her cover and Michael sad :
These is the most mistake I did in all my life !

In later time , society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building is abandoned because the government and country do nt have money for construction , to the point the building metal estructure was used as weapons .
After the revolution , construction will use for represented the win of revolution
Almost every family have a car now .
They use these car to travel , for shopping , to drive to work .
Only in the big city , people use public transport to will not be traffic .
My mother and my father had a fight to each other , they wanted not together .
They even asked me , I wanted to go with who , they grabbed my hands , wanded me go themself , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
I wanted we can live together forever , they taked care of me , loved me , we lived in the same house , we had a happy family .
I thinked these things .
Finally , I cried , because I could n't decide a choice , my father and my mother saw I cry , decided not keep going , and they saied sorry to each other and me .
I agree with your parents , maybe you could spend your money with something you really need and maybe you can buy computer games with the money you have left , or maybe you put aside money to buy something really important to you .
If I were you I wait to spend the money .
When I was at university student , I wanted to swim well but I could n't swim . because I did n't have to swim in my life .
so I decided to learn swim for summer vacation .
First , I registered a swimming pool then I went back to the swimming pool every day in the early morning .
After 6 months I could swim well until now .
so I satisfied my decision at 13 years ago .
Nowadays I usually went back to the swimming pool in the weekens .
Sometimes I got rid of my stress .
I thoght the swimming was the best of sports in my life because you can use your body muscle everything .
So you could a lose weight and gained muscles .
Some of my friends they did n't want to shown their body by someone . because a lot of students did n't have exercise .
We did n't have to enough time today .
but I always said my friends " If you want to have fit body , you will register swimming pool .
" So many friends learend to swim .
The report was discussed at our meeting , and we wish to congratulate you on completing this audit and providing the details and evidence on improving the outcomes from students results in this year .
One straight observation was the low number of students that have taken the math course .
We wondered if some work need to be done to increase the student attendance in the math courses .
It is true that there are five stages in the whole process.we can see that the processes begin with design and end at packaging and distribution .
looking at the information in more detail .
Initially , bank note should be considered the design such as background colour , artwork , and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides , special ink , and images slightly raised .
subsequently , this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets , the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched . if get bad sheets.the nest stage is disposal.band sheets and bank notes securely destroyed .
The diagrams show bank notes how to make , there are four steps to make the bank notes .
First , the bank notes are designed by consider , thinking from background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists .
And then , the sheets are printed , operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides , special ink , and images slightly raised .
Third , this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected , the this sheets are classified three areas .
The number one called good quality sheets , they will be packed and dispatched .
The next called partially damaged shees , and bank notes separaed into good and bad , good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed , the bad one will be destroyed by fair .
The number three called bad sheets , they will be securely destroyed .
This a method of making bank notes , and the operater should pay attention to the printed sheets how to inspect .
These pictures obviously show us what detailed steps of the bank to produce paper money into the application .
Before the production , they should think about the cover , including background color , artwork and codes which make it different from the illegal ones , then put them into the printing machines to create them .
On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands , that is to say , they should be separated into well - qualified ones , which are to be cut into bank notes , and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which ca n't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage .
In a words , the processing of making money to banks is very creative and serious , even rigid .
Look at you .
Rise your nose from your phone , and look at all these nice things that the life is giving us .
We have to live our life .
I think public transport do n't lost .
for example me , I do n't have a car thus I usually use a train in my school .
If I will go travel I think a car is very useful . but Movement of long distance is very tire .
Consequently , you ca n't fun travel .
Children ca n't get a car license thus children use Public transport .
Of course , Do n't have a car license people ca n't drive a car .
Accordingly , I think need public transport .
I think that members of our family ca n't be our best Friends , because maybe we do not have the same confidence that we have in our Friends .
For example , maybe you have a personal situation , that is very important to you , but you do not want your family know about it , so you decide to tell your best friend , because you know she wo n't tell anybody .
I think it depends on the situation , on the other hand , your sister or brother , can be one of your best Friends , you can tell them important things , but ask them not to tell your parents .
I 'm studying Business Administration , I think my major is so busy .
But also when I 'm working on a project which involves business , I feel rewarded .
Actually I realize that busynes is not for the major , everybody know Tec is very demanandant and if you wanna be there you must work hard .
I 'm dreaming to be an Business Administrator when I 'll be older , firstly I want to work an a sports company lik UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Finally I hope to get my own business .
Family members are the people who will company us in our whole life .
Compare to our classmates or co - workers , the members of our family know us the most .
Family members are the most important and best friends in our life .
First of all , family members are those who will keep in touch forever , so they know our habits the most .
Moreover , they know how to interact with us . They can make you happy , cheer up your mind and always support you when you are in trouble .
Families realize our mind so much ; However , our classmates or companies ca n't reach that because they do n't stay with us all the time .
Only families can know us the most because they live with us when we came to this world .
Final , family members will always prepare the food you like to eat .
They always give you what we like to eat .
In addition , they always supply much food to us so that we wo n't stay hungry .
Besides , eating with our families are one of the most happiness things in our life .
In conclusion , only family members know what we are most deeply .
Also , family members are the people that we will always want to stay in contact forever .
Because of the reasons above , we can say that the members of our family are our best friends !
Tennis , tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it 's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it , in first why I choose tennis ? , seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to it 's professional motion in playing the ball , from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship , so more time , time and time it was my favoirite sport .
my advice is be patient , be smart this sport not easy but it 's need more trainee , more time to be one of the greatest player in the game
I met my best friend , Aisha , at a friend 's in common party six years ago , when we were 25 .
While I was dancing she pushed my by accident , she did n't noticed it so I thought she was an arrogant person at first .
But , when our friend in common introduce her to me I realized that she was a funny and nice person .
She is also a good listener , she always know what to say in a bad moment and she is always there when a friend is in trouble .
Aisha is in his therties .
She 's from Marocco , so she has Arabian features , for example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and black expresives big eyes .
She is tanned and has a slim complexion .
Dear Redaction ,
I have just read , that you need reviews of soaps opera .
I have one favourite soap opera .
This is a ' Beverly Hills 90210 ' .
I love this film , because it shows teenagers life .
And I like see how they look like .
I like their style and live .
They learn at school , they have problems with each other , they fall in love , have parties .
Most of all I like Brenda , because she is a smart , beautiful person .
I would like to be like she .
I think that a lot of people can learn how to live , what think , eat , wear from this soap opera .
Although I have 5 members of my family but just one from 5 is my real friend .
She did a lot for me , my life
In my opinion , that is not a logical statement which jibes with the fact .
First of all , although travelling by car become more convenient , the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage .
The traffic jam becomes more and more serious as far .
Such as Beijing , the metropolis in China , faces the salient bad traffic as such government had to encourage the citizen go to work by public transport such as bus and subway .
Apparently , this method has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , the public transport is playing an important role in our daily life , It shows an indispensable effects on the society work .
The report is based on the opinions and ranking of people and critics that have been visiting these places .
In the town center there are most attractions as well as one of the best bars in the region " the Albastirca " .
Many visitors come to it but there are more attractions than only one bar .
What 's more about the town is that it is n't lacking shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has been recently opened up , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has been recently opened .
To sum it up I strongly suggest that the visitors stay as much as possible in this town as it has almost everything that a man needs .
Some people say there is no future for public transportation but I do n't think so .
Moreover , it is more approppiate to start constructing roads which were convenience for the majority .
first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you 're going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he 's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he 's playing .
Yesterday morning a group of American tourist went to a bike ride for through the center of Buenos Aires City .
One of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle , he seemed to have 28 year .
The mas was armed try to steal the backpack .
But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed .
He was furious because the American do n't understand what he would say .
The tourist was surprised to see a gun , the robber forced the man in the street and then the tourist put to run .
He was very lucky because the gunman returned to pick up his motorbike and keep his gun .
The man run to where his friends and sought a police .
They found a police near it and made the complaint , the group continued the bike ride and returned their hotel totally scared .
After two days and with the help of the filming the gunman was captured and brought to justice .
Now he was arrested and charged before a magistrate for the robbery , waiting for his sentence .
The tourists return to his country very scared .
How can I start ? should i start with speaking about myself or about my country or about my family or about my life ?
Let 's take me as an example , I am a 25 years old girl who is graduated from faculty of engineering and want to travel to Germany to complete my study but I am not able to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
College is the only place where i feel I am special that is why i always like to there .
Today , because of our progress of industry , we produced so many environmental problems that had n't appeared before .
For examples , lack of purity water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural source depletion , and etc .
The problems were n't so significant that we overlooked them , but now they become serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
Who we are ?
Why we make mistakes ?
As a nature of human , we would make mistakes .
But we should n't make same mistakes .
If you wrong , I will fix you and if I wrong , please fix me .
Anyway , we would make mistakes , if we do the new challenges and new tasks .
The aim of this report , is to show how does my town takes care of the environment .
Home rubbish :
The mayor , in collaboration with Lipor , distributed leaflets with information on " How to deal with household rubbish " .Each leaflet explains how to separate the home rubbish .
Instead of putting the rubbish in one trashcan , the families should separate it in three different groups - papers , glasses and plastics - and put it into the correct eco point .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects of the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recicling .
How does the town treats the environment :
The City Hall is very concerned in keeping the area cleaned .
In spite of the informative sessions about the enviorenment , organized by the Mayor for all of the residentes , it also has lots of staff that cleans the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
Eco friendly :
In conclusion , I would like to say that the city where I live maintaines the city cleaned and attractive , for people that live there and for those who visit the city .
I do believe that the members of my family are my best friends for many reasons.first of all , we got the same education as we grew together we know each other .
If I suffer from any problem the first step I do is I try to go back to my lovely sister because deep inside I know she is only member that can assist me .
Secondly , if I need money I will come back to my brother or sister I ask them to borrow some money .
I think public transport has good prospect in the future according on following reasons .
First , the trend of environmentally friendly has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel , taking public transport can decrease the air pollution by car , and more governments had build the public transport system including subway , buses etc .
The transport in the city is n't inconvenient as years ago .
The other is , travelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts , most famous resorts lack of parking lots , travelers may spend hours to park .
On the contary , people who take the public transport can more enjoy the travel because they do n't waste vitality on driving .
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantage of travelling by car was placed by public transport gradually , the future of the public transport is bright .
It gives me many a positive energy and fun .
I play just for yourself
Sometimes If I would like to play football but it rains I can watch football on television .
If I play with my best friends at football I will be a goalkeeper .
In football my favourite position is goalkeeper .
My advice is only one .
In Somalia , people usually throw the rubbish and garbage in everywhere , and there is no a cycle which intended to keep it .
The city council are tackling with how they can keep the city clean , and each and every morning there are employees whose work are to collect and keep the environment clean .
Many of the main roads of Mogadishu are getting attractive by the day and the people begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 time a week , swimming is a good sport especially in summer .
Study says the cool water will cool the body temperature down and that means it will burn the body fat fast then the other sport .
The other advantage of the swim is the less impact the knee .
Swimming will be the good exercise to the people who are not able to jog or even walk .
By the way , some people do n't like to swim because they have difficulty finding the swimming pool , I think that just an excuse to be lazy , the Internet will help you to find out .Lets go to swim .
FOOTBALL_MY FAVORITE SPORT
Nowadays , there are many choices to spend in our free time such as go shopping , travelling , listen to music , reading , etc ..
But to me , I choose playing sport in my free time .
Football - the most popular sport in the world , is well - known as " King Sport " .
There are two teams and each team has the same amount of players : maybe 6 , maybe 7 and maximum 11 .
I play football in my free time until now .
My first idea , football make us stay in shape , avoid some diseases .
A second idea , It helps us make new friends when I take part in some football team .
I have relationship with people who are playing football with me .
They not only help me in every match but also share me everything in daily life .
A finally idea , football makes us enjoy our life and increase quality of life so far after working hours .
Eating a balanced diet is something very important for anyone especially for pregnant women , children and old people as their bodies need more nutrition than younger people .
Although balanced diet will offer energy and vitality but that 's not all of the thing , Exercising is important too in addition to the balanced diet .
My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me .
I think the alcohol is the most dangerous addiction all around the world .
Because many people have died for this , and it 's really hard to stop this addiction even if the person wants to stop it .
my favorite sport is swimming
i swim 2 times per a week
sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin ,
i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! ! !

my mother in law she likes swimming too

If you want to visit me you have to do it in the next month because I have a football tournament , and I must participiate .
So what about next month , 12th of December?I would like to suggest a dish named " Bloody Liver " .
It could be strange for the others , but it is really delicious if served with corn .
It is a bit far from my home , behind the fuel station once we left your car .
To answer your question , I can not attend the party beacuse I do not like theese kind of parties , but I wish you good luck!Almos
We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections .
When it comes to public transport , the future is relatively dark according to the prospection .
Indeed all the indicators show that humain behavior will not change at least in the following decades .
Car continues to attract people .
In the other hand , Governments are not able to change transportation policies to enhance public transport level of service .
Around the city , there are a lot of containers for rubbish , pieces , plastic and crystal .
All people has very close someone to recycle .
Also , you can put clothes and shoes that you do n't need it for Africa children .
So , Malaga is responsible with the environment and with people with more necessities .
Secondly , in Malaga there are strong and hard rules for factories .
These companies must take care of the environment or they would have to pay big tax at the council .
So , in general , I think Malaga is very responsible with the environment and acts in consequence .
The way of livng change everyday : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' life , we notice many differences .
Above all they talked more : we live in the era of the telecomunication and none could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Be always in contact with our friends has become our way of living .
Moreover also simple things are changed , for example the food we eat : some times ago everythingh was natural , healthy ... but now everyone eat always " junk food " and thinghs like that , which are completely unhealthy !
However , How will people 's life change in the next 50 years ?
As a result of what I have just said , in my opinion people wo n't have a " really life " : everyone will be always more involved in the virtual life so that they will forget how to talk each other and how express own feelings !
About the foods , I imagine a future society in which restaurant wo n't exist : people will eat only junk foods and food , which has been prepared before , food in tin ... so all unhealthy thinghs , which will cause many problems .
For this reason I also imagine that in the future doctors and scientists will have so much to do !
Do not ruin our life , it could be all so perfect !
I started soccer when I was four .
When it is holiday , my brother and I play soccer twice a week .
Some fear are instinctive and it 's positive because it protect us from real danger , it 's a good response .
But the phobias are which we experience that are life - threatening and they can distrupt everyday life , but people can get over with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay mre attention to the real dangers .
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote his story ( the war of the worlds ) , so it was inevitable ; people began to see space creatures everywhere .
And the flying saucers ' culture has dominated . They will be green in color .
They will have three eyes , antennas over their heads , and guns firing green extraction .

When she entered the house , a man was looking at her with a bad face , when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father .
Alison left the house very scared , it was a dream .
Nowadays , public transport is used for many people in the cities , we can find different types of them , such as bus
tube and train , but is there a future for it or not ? , I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and finally I give my personal opinion .
To begin with , Public transports is not as comfortable as using our own vehicle , every day , about all in the morning , it is usually crowded , due to people than begin to work .
Secondly , moving in a city in public transport could be horrible , there are too many station , and we spend a lot of time on them until we arrived at home .
Although I have written some disadvantages , public transport is better than private .
Firstly , if anyone want to move in the city using the car , that could be very expensive , due to traffic jam .
Secondly , Public transport is more ecological and less polluted with the enviromment , so as it is producing less polluted fume , and many of them use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than never before , cities contains more automoviles and the pollution is worse , we need to change our mind , and try to use them as other alternative to improve the enviromment of our cities .
Last week , my class and I went to Sicily for a schooltrip .
we visited many cities .
the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos , the day after we visited Siracusa , the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani .
I enjoyed all the cities we saw but the best in my opinion is Siracusa . in particoular I liked Ortigia that is the oldest part of the city .
I also liked the Valley of the temples of Agrigento so much : it was amazing .
I think that the worst thing of the trip is that the last night in our room there were a lot of insects and some spiders and we must change Room .
public transport now a days has become a bit uncomfortable because we can not think of availability of seat .
large number of people use it which results in over - loaded buses and trains .
it take too much time to travel by public transport than by personal vehicle.there is scarcity of buses in public transport and there timings too are not fixed .
traveling by car or any other personal vehicle is too much more convenient because it takes too much less time and it takes us directly to the place where we want to go .
In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation , although public transport like buses , train , ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems .
In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations , but with their own transport we do n't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time .
We do n't have to book tickets in private transport .
So we can say that travelling in their own transportation is more comfortable .
People had drived car to go a work .
The city have a lot traffic .
They prefer to go work car than bus .
Public transport is very cheap then car and reduce traffic in the city .
It 's true drive by car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wait bus .
They can drive any hour , they can to go and to come any moment .
They can travel another place , independent the hour .
Bus , boat and train are public transport most used for people .
Some cities there are n't boat , because do n't have river or sea .
It 's comum in city the bus .
Some bus have special and preferencial sit to old people .
This is interesting because people are practice solidary .
I think could have a lot bus in city .
Many car is poluent for planet and is alergic to people .
The train do n't have poluition .
This transport is better to population and do n't have traffic in city .
Another idea is ride a bicycle and to walk street .
This can help heauthy the people and city will stay most clean .
So we must reduce by car on street .
We will be very happy and we .
will be more heauthy .
My favourite sports walk , I really like this sport for several reasons :
1- It 's very common I can do it anywhere and anytime I want .
2- It 's very cheap , I will not buy anything to do .
3- It 's not hard sport , in all cases I will not be tired after walking .
4- It makes me relax because I stop doing my activity from work and study .
5- It gives me big time to think on all my life without any distributions from anybody .
cause all these reasons walking is my favourite sport .
From few years , people use different types of transport . We ride by bus or by car .
We fly at plane or something other .
The travelling by car is more convenient in my opinion .
Firstly , you save money if you use a car .
When you ride by bus , you pay more .
Moreover you travel with the other people .
You stay in queue for buy a ticket .
Secondly , you should feel uncomfortable .
At some means of transport is too crowded and you haven ' t got a place to stay .
sometimes you lie on a window .
Finally , if you ride a car you musnt care about timetable . You can go at every hour .
When you go by bus for example , you must wait at cold bus station .
I hate this .
At sum up , in my opinion travelling by car is better .
You do n't have to worry that you do n't arrive in time .
Unfortunately , is very sad to say that people in my town does not care about the environment .
We need to start doing something to avoid contamination .
So many storms , and all the things happening around the world are the result of not taking care of the only planet we have to live .
I suppose their lifstile intolerable , resteless and I really sympothise with them Magotity of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of shortage of ptivate lifetime perpetual attention .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities bit through thick and thin they go on .They archieve the goals made exceptionally in sake of money and vanity .
Thank you for your care .
There is one thing confuse me that is the old extension number .
I always answer some wrong calls and these calls distract me .
I receive many calls looking for the previous worker and I need to spend my time to explain what happened to him .
Also there are many places to see , mountains , lakes where you can relax and have fun .
I also work in summer as a waitress in a terrace .
I 'm writing you a letter because I was made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what is the film about and how was the experience .
The idea of make a film comes up a Saturday night at a meeting of friends .
At first we thought that the idea was just a joke , but Jake , one of my friends , said that he had carried a video camera .
When Jake said that , we start roar with laughter , but then , another friend offered the idea to do a home film .
The experience about the film was amazing , because we laugh all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea .
In itself , the film did n't have an especially topic , but I can describe it like friend 's film as appears lot of laughts , jokes , and it reflected that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
By the way , I 'm sending the film together with this letter .
I started running to lose weight and ended in a life changing experience .
Some may say that running is very similar to religion , but to me is more than that .
Running is cheap and everyone can take up running , no experience required after all it is just one step after the other .
In My country Bus 's car is the essential public transport .
So I got a lot troubles :
1 . Everyone spends much times to travel .
2 . Bus car 's driver does n't care people who around him .
That means he is a careless , who always drives too fast
But public transport has advantages : If we uses it is the essential transport to travel .
Therefore environment will be improved .
Maybe traffic 's accident is decreased
I am writing to report on the local transport of Toluca .
The public transport most used in Toluca is el bus because it is the most cheaper , but it is very bad and unsafe , the qualiti of it is very bad , the buses are old and obsolete these have broken windows and old and broken seats .
The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition , in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses .
The public transport is unsafe because growth the theft and kidnapping express to users .
I suggest changing the old buses by new buses and put security cameras in the buses .
That the cameras transmitted immediately the image of the robbers at other buses to ensure that they are alert , and that the drivers receive training and sanctions by conduct bad .
I think we live very quick , always running , we do n't enjoy our lives .
Because we want a lot of money , a lot of things ... we are always working for giving more money , we do n't meet our neighbour for example .
Maybe in the future will be worse .
There is is no future for public transport because car has made life so easy .
It 's economically and practically is more expensive .
Prefer to use cars instead of public transport .
In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her / his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm .
I think it 's very important as it reduce the problem of both pollution and population we use few transport as it is big and carry a lot of people .
underground , trains and buses these means of transport are cheap so it helps the poor to save some money .
governments should take care of public transport they should save means of entertainment peoples should keep them clean and safe if they use it carelessly it will be useless Now There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier , faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars
Now a day 's travelling became easier for the humans to move all over the world .
Many of the people habituated to use their own vehicle as their transport , where they can reach their destination in time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my view in this controversial issue .
firstly , We are having different modes of transport facilities , which among is road transport .
As Automotive Industries are huge in market , most of the house holders prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time .
And there need not to be depend on the public transport of their journey .
As private transport is increasing day by day , it 's surprises that there may not be any public transport in up coming days .
Secondly , if the private transportation is growing faster , the traffic is also going to create a major problem , which effects the global warming .
And the income that is getting through this servicing transport will automatically dropdown , which create a problem to the economy of the government .
Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as public transportations like , bus service , cab service , auto service .... etc , in order to full fill their basic needs .
People with more unemployment may also lead to a crime rate .
I hope , giving equal priority for both public and private transportation makes healthy .
And we can see that controlling traffic is not going out of the hands .
Here , in this country there are typical dishes , desserts , drinks .
Some of them are , roast , mate and some others , but those are the best known .
On the one hand , I like to have things typical in each country , apart from they are delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go and experience with the food too .
On the other hand , the bad thing about when there are so delicious food , it 's that always you want to eat some typical food of your country and at the end it 's very bad for the body because we eat them in excess .
In ten years , they did n't change that things , because they are delicious and no one would like to eat anything other than roast !
i think if the goverment do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
the public transport is the best way to save the planet and have a best atmosphere ; also we safe money and can meet people .
it is true the car is more confortable , but it uses a lot of mineral recurses like petrol wich can contaminate the ambient .
i do nt think the public transport does not have future , there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport .
Public transport is very much complicated now a days .
Place like Mumbai is full of People and no place to park the vehicles .
Day by day people are increasing in Mumbai .
Crowd is more and all the people want to travel by public transport so it is difficult to travel . Best way to travel in there
This will saved their time .
Transport are good way to travel from place to another place .
I had word with a boy and he will reply to me by tomorrow .
Internet is a useful means for everyone , so we are getting on with distant friend , and we look for important information when we are studying or entretainament themself .
First of all , I am going to talk about adavantages and disadvantages for this topic .
First adavantage , is Interent too much quick , for example when you want information about something .
Second advantage is Internet by website , such as twiter , facebook ... You allow speak with your quick friend , or you can meet ith them by website , therefore you do not call by telephone , so internet is too much cheap .
According to disadvantanges , at present , childs are aways playing with his computer games and mobile phone .
Both computer game and mobilephone have got internet , as a result , they have not got time the another traditional games .
Other disadvantages is that , people do not meet with friends , since they speak by website Internet , so every time there is unless relationship , the people is not sociable .
To sum up Internet is an progress more important in the world , but too there are a lot disadavantages and advantages .
In my point of view , Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse , so carring out another activities .
Good Thriller was not my favorite type of gender until I saw ' No Escape ' .
This movie is about what happens in the real life right now , on the other side of the world .
They persecute an American family that went because of the dad 's job , which was something about a company that the natives from that place hated most .
Without expecting it at all , this family went somewhere over Asia to start a new way of living .
In other words , they had to get use to a different kind of world .
They had to escape with the doors from the country closed , while making sure both girls did n't get their minds full of junk ( people killing ) .
And in some of the scenes the little girl escaped or the dad had to make them jump from a building to another one !
We were having a good time .

I am interested in your advertisement you post in an English language magazine .
Recently I have got a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me ILETs score 6.5 for visa .
I have studied this exam not at all and I have got a very limited time , around 3months , before the last test so I would like to begin as soon as possible .
I am working daytime so night time , 6 pm to 9 pm , or anytime on weekends would be good for me except on Mondays and Wednesdays when I play basketball as a hobby .
Also I am thinking of studying with you for 2months but we can talk more about this later .
I am good at speaking and listening sections but not confident at writing , especially essay I 've never learnt in my life so I want to focus on this writhing part more than others .
Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport .
When we talk about public transport , there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car .
Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites
I think there is a big future for public transport , because a lot of people want to take that and more than anything else that is convenience .
Especially some people do n't have a car and some elderly persons difficult to driving a car by themselves , so the public transport helpeing them a lot .
Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip , but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more , because so many people expectation .
I like a car as well , but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel , so the public transport is making connection with human beings .
It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future .
Every Human has points of strength and weakness .
So , the Humans including women and men should behave according to these points .
The question which is rising now should the employer hire women in some posts and excludes them from another , and so that for men .
There are two answer to this question , the first one is to who sees that it is right to exclude women from some jobs .
For example , the builder needs physical strength to carry cements and bricks .
The mechanic should have the ability to afford drawbacks of the job .
The second answer is it is not correct to exclude men or women from any posts .
The explanation of those who support the second answer is every one had borne equal in duties and rights .
So there is no one can hire someone or give anyone a job according to gender .
Is convenient take a year off between leaving school and starting the university ?
I think it is not necessary and not recommendable because you have the possibility to earn money and is difficult once you get used to earn money , you want to study again .
Also , if you want to travel , you have to make money for that and then , travel .
Furthermore you do n't study during this period and when you want to start the university you would n't be able to remember some important things
People use public transport because of saving money .
Therefore , it is likely to imminent that public transport will no longer exist in future .
think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time , and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things , but I thing , that have future , because a lot people even they use public transport to .
the people use the public transport also the people needs to move for all the city .
what I ' m saying is that if you have future public transport that people use so much that you will have future
Convenience is not the only one consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of people choice public transport for travelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes faster than driving a car .
In recent years , governments encourage people to take public transport because of fuel crisis .
Some of governments invest much money to construct public transport network to make travelling by public transport more convenient .
When driving a car , we will face a parking space trouble in a city .
Besides , a traffic jam is another problem .
My mother is my inky best friends in my family , she always listening to me , sometimes i call her with her real name!.
She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !
, i love her so much , i do n't know how will my world being like without her and i wo n't to know .
I pray everyday to save my mother and all my family to me .
My name is Tom , I 'm 12 years old .
I have a black skin , black hair .
I am wearing a shirt , and a pair of trousers .
I will wait for you at the train station
Well , there 're a lot of sport that people practise every day but I have one which is my favourite .
This sport have a lot of type of match which you can play .
You can play with your friends or in a team even alone but this option is the most boring .
Basketball is a perfect sport because you can develop your reflections and your ships with people .
I enjoy playing basketball because I relax when I play it and I can meet new people and travel around your city or your country . That it 's the best because you can visit the cities ...
And you enjoy between your mates and live all those special moments with them .
I can give you some advice to start practising this sport .
This 's a sport that improve your friendships and it 's so good for your health .
And maybe you became a famous player or a simple player but you feel like a famuos .
A river passes by the city and , occasionally , there were floods on the place .
Tired of having their house destroyed , the landlords decided to build a new house on the hill , so they would n't be molested by floods anymore .
There is a tale that mentions a treasure hidden on the house .
After the war , the gold has been left in the house .
There are 7 billion people in the world , and it is increasing rapidly .
How many car for all of people in the world ?
Have you ever driven on the crowded city and moved with 1 km/h .
More people use public transport , less car on the road , you can walk and enjoy the city .
Besides , it 's also an environment problem , exhaust fumes engulfed the earth , more car is used , more exhaust gas release , we are killing our mother .
In addition , those who live on below average incomes do not have money to buy car .
Automobile is luxury in some country , like mine .
It 's the way to prove you wealthy , when you get a car to your home , or go to school , work by a car , people will change their mind about you .
Public transport is being become a must - have mean with many people who have low - income .
In conclusion , Public transport is our future means , I mean for almost citizen .
Not car though it 's convenient .
my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it
I have read an article on IFLS talks about a sheep has human face .
It shows in the video that the sheep actually has big nose and lips just like human .
Which is one of the weirdest thing I have seen .
They say the reason why he has a human face is the farmer gave his mom an extra dose of Vitamin A. As a result , that causes the deform in his face .
In my opinion , I think it is just coincidence that the sheep looks like human .
On the other hand , the farmer who owns the sheep refused to sell the sheep for higher price than normal to the circus .
I think the sheep should be transfer to a place where is specialty in animal with same condition .
life is a long journey .everday , we gain more & more experience .
we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future .

Dear Sir Stuart Thomson ,
Nowadays technolgy is more modern than in the past and people always developing their invention to become more useful .
We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy , every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy .
And because of technolgy our lofe become easier .
One of the example is television , in the past we use it only for watching news and movie , but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t , now television has others function .
Television can be used tor many things , usually we watch television for entertaining , but we can also use it for education too .
First , television has many programs which are can be used for education .
Many programs consist lessons for kids to learn , for kids who still want to learn speaking and know the words , it is very useful because many programs are very suitable for their to help them learn faster by watching television .
Besides that we can also use television to make us become knowledgeable , by watching news programs .
Second , tthese days television become modern and it make television can connected with internet .
By that advantage , now we can easily search and get information from the internet by using television .
We can search it on browsing or we can also access youtube to help us .
So we can watching a program that we wanted so we can choose what is good and not .
In conclusion , televeision can entertain and also educate because television programs make it in interesting way .
My favourite sport is football I enjoy playing football with my friends we play at night it was very excited to play when the sky was rain .
When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal !
But we were too interested .
We enjoy watching football match
my favourite sport is football .
I 'm not good at playing it , if I prefer to play volleyball , but I like to watch the games .
The emotions the only try if you 're a fan of any team , and you know the happiness that you feel when it wins , it 's indescribable .
Footbal is usually a sport that appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a girl that sometimes I realize that I know more than some males .
I started following football in 2007 , just 10 years old , I started because I fell in love with a team that then led me to love football in general .
I like to watch the games at home with my father , but mostly always go to the stadium with my dad , you feel indescribable emotions . and my father was to convey this passion .
The future for the public transport should n't be taken lightly , in my opinion , the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle .
For many years the public transport had allowed that the people travel a long distance for work that otherwise would not be possible .
Better still the future of the public transport is essential for a better life without traffic .
When we used the car , for general , one person is the unique who is accustomed to using your own car , so not is exploiting the potential of this car .
At the time , we need more cars for more people , that 's the meaning for more traffic .
it 's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society , and a good way for move us of the one place at other , I suggest that the government has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport .
Hi freddy ,
I have recived your letter .
The man usually wear their best suits and the woman have long dresses on

Once you have in mind by inviting others to get home and watch TV is what people expected !
The big deal is entertaining , and quality is part of it .
Keep it in mine what you should do before buying your own dreaming TV .
You should consider that large and being untouchable TV is what you must find in one .
However people nowadays look for a good design and not for quality , the big problem is that prize is against quality , even though a good designing of TV series on well known stores is the big option that we can choose to check .
Consider a good prize and good quality by checking and visiting stores , you should not spend too much money by buying the biggest TV or largest , you can save money by only watching few minutes on stores , have your sit , enjoy and list if you are convinced .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies in your own TV considering prizes and qualities , some TV brings you the experience to enjoy your favourite movies in other scenery , will you try ?
People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue , the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality , whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country .
Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service .
In my opinion our lives will have a dramatic change in the next 50 years .
You just have to think that 50 years ago we did n't know what a smartphone or a laptop was , in the schools we used book of paper and not tablet or iPad , and now technology is part of our lives .
I think and hope that maybe in 50 years scientists will find a cure for many disease and that would change our life because we could live for more time .

Why not?.Firstly , what 's for you education?,It 's very clear for me that education is to create the conditions to do your thinkings grow .
If the way to do that it 's easy and nice I think at the end is better than explain theory concepts .
Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things .
while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm , only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day .
That 's why I think that it 's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity .

In Cáceres take care of the environment .
The People in this city are aware that there are care of nature .
Therefore in this city there are not many factories .

The yellow container is for plastic as water bottles , the blue container is for cardboard as milk brick , the green container is for glass as glass bottles .
Everyday , sweepers clean the Caceres street and the people teach their children that the rubbish do n't throw in the street .
Sagrada Familia , or also called Gaudi 's Cathedral , is a very touristic Roman Catholic church located in Barcelona which is still in construction .
Antoni Gaudi was the Catalan architect who design it in 1798 and in 1882 its construction got started .

However , one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I ca n't forget it forever .
One night , as usual , I slept .
In a flash , I rolled down from a mountain and I did n't know where I was .
It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange , After , I felt my body ache .
I began to yell that hoped someone could save me to leave from here .
Fifty minutes passed , when my body no longer was sore .
Constantly , I just walked like without terminal contest .
While I strugged to walk .
Finally , I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up .

Nowadays we see an enormous improvement of infrastructure .
Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example , because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses ; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport , in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car , which in turn revolutionary our life .
Well , the form that we use the television depend one each on .
Will has people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but has too their people that use television for searchs .
For example , the chanel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of informations of animals and how it lives .
In my opinion the people use television for distraction .
When we come after the job , or school , we need a form to relax .
Maybe studies we make otherwise ; in search on computers , in books , etc ...
The television 's use is staying more and more utilized by the people ; so we are getting more problems of vision .
It looks like a kind of addiction ... We need to use the technology on our behalf .
The capitalist 's world make us increasingly become us updated .
So we have to watch the national Journal for keep us connected .
Now a days everybody have conditions to buy a television , so the numbers of the tv viwers get up ; even being poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
There are no apologizes to be a informed person .
To go shopping , is one of these things that you can love or , like it happen to me , you can hate at all .
Normally , I 'm not spending a lot of time on going shopping , even when I really need something .
In general , I find it very boring and stressed .
If I must do it , my favourite way of shop is the high street of my town , or in another town or country .
These shopping centres , full of people and noise , are crazy !
Shopping online is neither , from my experience , a good way of shop .
In my case , I 'm always wrong with the sizes and to return the products , takes me a long time and a great effort , so it does n't worth it .
Much better is to take a walk in the high street , and make from this time something for pleasure .
Socializing online help us to contact with our friends by easy way in different places and this way cost us money .
Socializing person does not cost us money , but we need one place to contact each other .
Finally , we enjoy in both ways in our life .
For the last years , the public transport has been forget .
The people who do n't use the public transport , think that travelling by car is much better .
But they do n't know the big problem with the pollution .
If everybody uses the public transport , the world be much better . and the people will be stress less , because they will be not worried about parking places or be in the traffic .
Maybe it will be a really good opportunity for the people , being more healthy too .
Compared with local bookstores , publishers or media such as newspapers considering the Internet market , public transportation has much better future .
You have to take vary much cares when you carry humans .
Even though people trying to develop drones to reduce logistic costs , it is difficult to apply the technology to carry humans .

Also , the automatic driving technology is already applied for trains .

Also I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is in a summy day .
The advice that I give to someone who want to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
So these are the advice that i give for them .
English - I find it greating !
I ca n't pronunciate well .
I do n't know the stress of words is where .
it 's so difficult .
So bored when I ca n't continue learn English .

An clean or healthy environment is always acceptable to all kinds people .
Our city is quite clean and livable , people are more careful than before .
They are sincerely manage wastage and avoid carbon generated products .
Also obedient to the rules and regulation of the city authority .
Initially , Waste management system of our locality is comparatively effective than before .
Our authority now follow the scientific method for rubbish control ; recycle , reuse , galvanization .
As a result , the city dwellers are now enjoying more healthy environment .
It is a more expected criteria , why the authority step up many organization working for waste management .
Due to our helpful people is works become easier .
Most of the cases , not only my family members but also our neighbor like to avoid carbon level increasing products those are responsible for temperature increase .
Many organizations work for making up the consciousness of the pupil , so people are more sensitive about the environmental pollution .
Now government is working for decreasing smoke emission of the mill and industry .
Scientists and researcher jointly work for carbon emission lessening .
Some advancement happened already , it 's implementation also runs with full speed .
Last but nor least , the strict rules and regulation have more effective impact on to make a good town .
Our authority is more careful about the rules and regulation ; hence no - one can eschew the rules .
The job announcement on your webpage immediately took my attention , as it has always been my dream to work for the German - Norwegian Youth Forum and the requirements meet just the skills that I can provide you with .
The first time I took part in the youth forum was in 2012 and since then it has been a big part of my life .
Influenced by it I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Since 2013 I am studying English and Marketingscommunications at University College Syddanmark .
It is well accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable , and following is my reasons .
Firstly , shopping can waste you so much time .
You may not realize when you shopping happily .
But you may find that when you notice you have many things still need to finish .
You may come across something , such as luxury bags , but you can not buy it because of the tight budget .
Furthermore , even you just buy something you can afford , you may also waste much more money .
So , based on what I have written , I think shopping is not always very happy . We can find something much happier than shopping easily .
My favourite sport is cricket . I love cricket very much since from my school time .
cricket is a game of bat and ball in which there are two teams which have eleven players on each side .
generally we are using criket ground as a oval shape .
Travelling by car is certainly much more convenient than travelling by tram or trolley bus , which only follow the lines of their routes .
But thinking about the environment , traffic jams and sometimes absence of parking places makes me changing the statement .
On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to , on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive , you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones : tram , bus or trolley bus is your wayout .
HOW YOU CAN THE BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
Good question about item , how can answer , if you would win £ 100 .
I have a few easy recepts , how you can be a well off £ 100 and how you can help the environment .
Firstly , I describe how I can help my local environment and what I do useful for item .
I am a very stricte keen ecology person for 10 years .
I am interesting about natural ways how we could help in the local area .
I am a serious fan of environment .
I describe how it looking my every day .
I tend to drive with my bicycle from home to work , I do n't used my car or buses for long time , because is not healhty and costs .
A bicycle is for me the best way how we can be do fit and a good condition and also to more less polution without cars .
Secondly , I save water and electricity , because costs are quit expensive .
So , my bills from water are inexpensive , because I swap to have a bath than take a shower .
Next point is an issue , that if I am not at home I do switch off the temperature .
I switch on a home hiting for a temporary time , when I am working off I used more energy to warmht at home .
Next point is a fact , that recycle glass and paper is most important .
I tend to collect in three different boxes of waste , for paper , second for glas and plastic and third for rest rubbish .
It 's a very domestic and a huge issue for us life .
We learn to really segreation of waste and in the future how e.g.:we could use second time a same glass .
Finally , we are obligatory to care about the environment , because it 's us duty .
I think it is true , because o lot of people like travelling by car .
But there are some problems like these - how will drive a lot of people who do n't like to drive or ca nt drive because he has some problems with the health .
Anyway , a lot of people will need some transport in some cases not privat , but public , and we ca nt say that this kind of transport willl not be useful .
May be , in small part
Some years ago when the weather was colder here people had eaten more meat with wine .In fact growing vegetables was not possible because of the weather .
In fact today people interested in drinking wine during participating at parties or meeting with friends .
There are various opinions about how foods plays essential role in our lifestyle .
Potatoes and meat are popular food between our people .
Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life .
Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more .
Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy .
It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs .
In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us .
In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable .
The members of my family is no where near my best friends .
You see , I do not see members of ones family ones best friends because personally I did n't and still do n't have a great relationship with anyone in my biological family .
And this may have effected my way of thinking and acting in different situations .
So no , my members in my biological family is n't my best friends .
Thank you for giving me the chance to transfere the information as per your request .
For my town , there are many regulations that are forced by the municipality and environment ministry , such as preventing animals like ( sheeps , horses , cows .. etc ) , from being in the town and in the population areas .
Besides , due to the critical situation we are living and facing in iraq .
As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators , that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it 's smoke , the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise .
people , espicially grnerator 's owner , start using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution .
Other resedential areas , using their potentialsto maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , having nemourse green spaces .
Also recycling the trushes are a very inteligent way to keep the town clean , and get multiple use of the products in industry lines .
on the Otherhand , eldest people in our city having many socity responsiblties that are encourging the youngest ages to participate in the annual gardening festival , for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
Although , each house can make a real difference by taking good care of the infront area and keeping it clean .
Hope that those information are of good use .
Michael and Marcuangolo were friends but in the school they were enemies .They had amazing battles in the playground .
One day at the end of the classes , Marcuangolo wanted to hit him , and Michael ran away .
A car crashed and Marcuangolo started bleeding .
There was a doctor at the emergency room and Michael explained the problem to him .
They brought Marcuangolo to a room and put the boy in a bed .
The doctor ask for his phone number and he phoned his parents .
Michael understood that he must take away .
As soon as I came on university , my life changed .
Before I entered university , life in high school had n't a lot of friends and I was so lonely but after I started to study at Ton Duc Thang university , I became more happy , comfortable and interactive .
In my class , I have a group of close friends , and they treated me very well .
I'll have a friend at university because I scared strangers .
The first day when I studied at the university , I had a lot of friends .
we sit around together and talk about where they live .
At the weekend , I like going for a walk and get some fresh air with my friend .
We laughed and eating together .
I was very happy at the time , and I have the friend sincerely .
I expect we 'll be the best friends forever .
it was a wonderful experience with me
I was walking to football training session with my friend Michal last week .
We were talking about the last match , we were discussing our faults , when suddenly we heard a loud noise .
I ran to help them and also we called the ambulance .
I am living in Deria which is located in Dubai .
It is small and quite city .
I like the Indian resturants in the city , in addition infrastructure and roads are well orgnaise .
obeying to the statement above , it 's necessary to say that is a very interesting topic , because it 's quite related to actual problems , such as problems in the environment .
This is to say that most part of cars are not green , namely , current cars are not designed for generate a good impact in the environment .
Regarding the reason for the described situation is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies which are intended to get as much money as possible , regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals .
For multinational maybe ?
Or for some consumers that can afford a toxic and expensive car ?
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , is less harmful indeed , in terms of the impact received by the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , meanwhile each new car means increasingly pollute .
Travelling by would be more convenient with a good conscience of protect the planet .
The idea of banned cars from the centre of all major cities have advantages and disadvantages .
The good things about not allow cars in the cities centres are that the traffic will be reduced , the trips will be faster and the contamination will be less .
On the other hand the bad things are that you have to park out of the city centre and these areas will be crowded , you could n't visit places with your car and people with physical problems could have difficulties with public transport .
In my opinion it is a good idea , but perhaps the restriction could have exceptions for certain people and certain days and hours , or if you need to visit a particular place with your car you could ask for a special permission .
The village I live , there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment , some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage , to avoid this we teach the younger 's enviromentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or , candies to the floor they also can help the older people , there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street's , floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the do n't they wo nt be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they were visitors , in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and , other more institutions , we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us

On the other hand it is very economic than owne car .
Whatever you can save the time and go any where more quickly by public transport .
Nowdays , in school we learn a lot of subjects , which we less or more use in our lives , some of them are really important , but some of them are just wasting of time .

I have one big brother he is 14 years old and goes to mörby skolan .
I have only lived on one place in my life .
I like parkour because its really fun i also like guitar and playing video games .
The best place i 've visited is probably orlando because i like all the amusement parks and roller coaster .
My favorite is the hulk roller coaster at universal studios .
My favorite foods is pizza , tacos and Kebab .
The given topic to write about is a common issue now a days in my country .
Public transport is not convenient for most of the people because every person wants to reach on time at his place but using public transport it is very difficult to reach on time .
all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear 's pizza open , the establishment it 's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots , in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy , Bonnie and Freddy .
Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band .
Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove , The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story .
When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song , Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children , This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child .
In 1983 The pizza restaurant reopened with more security and robots with more friendly appearance .
The establishment seek a security guard who had to keep the pizza restaurant at night , I am the security man .
When I saw the advertisement about the job in this moment I think that is very easy , I called the number , they give me the information and I accept .
The rules are simple just see the laptop , watch the animatronics , wait to 6:00am and close the doors if you needed I say OK .
My first night was easy because only see the screen and pass the camera to camera and nothing strange happened , I could only hear footsteps and noises .
My second and third night they were very strange because in the cameras the animatronics move as if it wanted to get to my room and do something to me .
The fourth and fifth night were the worst because the animatronics were very active , closed it and opened the doors because they try to get into my room .
but I could survive the night .
After tonight remove me the place and never went back to Freddy 's Pizza
Imy name is Lorenza .
My hair are browns and my eyes are dark . I will arrive in the Central Station at eleven o'clok and I will wear a read cot and a yellow scarf .
In this holiday I go to Barcelona with my girlfriend .
It is an amazing city , it is really enjoy .
It is the most European city of Spain .
After a long flight , it reaches the orbit that is very long way far out of the solar system .
NASA replied as a very amazing achievement that Rosetta reaches out of solar system .
This may become a have leap after Armstrong landed on the Moon .
NASA replied that Rosetta will keep on its journey on travelling across the Universe .
Travelling by car becomes a comfortable factor nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we want , we can start at our desired timings .
This would gradually kill public transport .
One more reason is that banks provides loan at a lower interest which makes people to buy one to improve their comfort level .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themselves .Everyone want to improve his life to be better but how without doing anything . we must to start with education and healthy which are most important things to be better .
everyone need to focus not only his education but also on others .
To learn , to read , to be knowledge .
We need to focus on our inner skills and improve it .
No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one .
Our great example in changing is German .
after the second world war the improved themselves in 50 years and became one of the most developed countries .
In my city is very usual to find many dog 's shits in the road .
Is a big problem and it is almost a miracle not stepping one .
The solution I think would be to fine to owners .
I think that not is a problem of awareness .
I think the people know that his dogs litter the city but they prefer not to do nothing .
It is easier and more comfortable .
If they would had to pay then they would do .
In general the city looks clean .
In the hall tow care about city Center .
These also can be a problem because recently they are falling because they are older .
The hall tow has created a group that works studying the tree 's age to prevent further falls
We should must proper planing for our city to proper look after of it .
Actually , there are many huge problems are in your city just as there are no any proper drainage system for it not any specific canal system through which we can properly cleaned our city .
There , is another issue that is due to huge transport but little bit road they are not wide enough so that most of people are distributed due to these issues .

My favorite sports/ hobbies is windsurfing and sailing .
The best place i ever have been on is an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
Its not much trees there and a lot of high mountains .
There is much that i 'm proud of in my life but actually i do n't know what i 'm most proud of .
A very big weakness i have is that i can forget nearly everything especially homework and other school stuff .
Three words that describe me really good is :
happy funny and sometimes bothersome
A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when i m sleeping .
some day i want to go to Bali because it 's seems like a really nice place .

If you have a car you would probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who does n't have a car so they are used to go by bus and for them this way of travelling has become more conveniet because they have done it since they were children .
Then whatever the opinion you get is the result of the social situation in what you live .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment , about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places , because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries , and also cars available all the time , you can go at 4 am and no one say anything , because its yours , but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night , in emergency situation for example , what you will do , if you do not have your own car , your kid is sick , or you wife or your old parents , and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community , we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems , and more oil stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time .
Everyone use public transport every day .
It is difficult to imagine how we can live without it .
But in spite of this a lot of people have a dream about a car .
The most said that using a car more convenient than using a public transport .
Of course private transport has a lot of advantages like : you do n't need to wait for a bus at the stopes or you can go every where you want in the time convenient for you .
How are you ? You know , it has been a long time since we have met each other why do n't we go to the cinema .
We are going to find a romantic movie or fiction movie .
So what time will you finish session ?
I will wait for you in the gate cinema .
27-dresses is a romantic comic and funny film , it is recommended for all ages .
I saw it with my family , my children and my husband , we had a good afternoon .
The film is based on a girl , she is invited to many weddings in which she is a maid of honor in all of them .
She has twuenty seven dresses of maid of honor , meantime , she call in love with a boy who is very handson , but he is working in a magazine and he has written about weddings in the city , he is a good writer , and she unknowns that .
The plot is well constructed , since the beginning becomes quite gripping .
The main characters , the actors are very younger and enjoyable .
This history develors a mixture of themes that courage , family values , friendly and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you shoudl go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nowadays we have a lot of environmental problems .
Transport polution is one of the most dangerous .
Almost every family have more than one car .
As a result roads are overloaded and long kilometres traffic jumps damage open air .
On the one hand that quantuty of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's personal right to have it or not .
On the other hand the government should think about some measures for protecting environment .
For example inventing severals special dates in a year for using only public transport .
Also improving measure might be as an encreasing green areas in cities and towns .
Unfortunately many tourists do n't take care about saving personal spaces ( on the river bank or on the sea beach ) in clean .
Factories damage nearest areas and water extremaly bad .
In my opinion , firstly , new bilding on the banks must forbidden at all .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring environment must be very strick .
I think , nature'll get the most important benefits if everybody takes care about own space in the best way .
Sports is a unique way by which a person can maintain his or her health including both aspects that are physical and mental .
The different formats of cricket allow me to maintain my health based on time available after earning my bread for the day and it is needless to say after sharing the precious moments with my lovely family .
I often participate in friendly matches to keep physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting lot of stress on physical abilities , it is needless to say the day can be tiresome if one may decide to play in the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging how you would keep up your mantle status .
It does require to explore your brain while developing strategies against the opponents .
Top of all , one has to learn to maintain the sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated moments on the field .
In the present world television is very important .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way .. most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study material for example smart classes ,
online courses etc . television is more important media we can improve our language with the help of the television.now we can see
that so many films with the help of television and we can see other programs also.according to the present world without television
no one can live as a human being so that we can say that television is more impotent .

hello!I am 32 years old girl from Italy .
I really love take care of myself and so the last years I decided to do walking every day in the evening .
It 's takes 1 hour and at the end I am very happy and in a good mood .
I love walking near the arbour of my city , so I can have a look to the beautiful sea ! when I walk I feel the clean wind and so I take long breaths .
If you walk on the seaside in the evening you can have also the possibility to see the sunset over the sea .... that ' great emotion ! I feel good in that way and even my soul can have a breath .
I suggest everybody having the same evening walking , you need just a pair of comfortable shoese !
commuters prefer to travel by car compared to public transport .
The main reason for people do n't like to travel by public transport is due to overcrowding
Travel by train is very expensive nowadays .
Like you know , I was work in a youth camp the last year , so that if you want to take this job I would like say some things that will help you .
In the positive side , the size of the groups is really small .
This kind of job is very useful if you want improve your English skills .
On the negative side are the labor conditions . The money is not enough for pay the level of living in London and else the money for " travel expenses " , in my case , arrived until November !
In any way , I recommend that you take the job for August , because I have listened that in this month the organization is better than in July .

It 's much faster much more convenient than using public transportation .
The only drawback that comes along using cars is limitation in fuel resources .
However , it seems that each day a new source for extracting fuels is exploring .

It is more than thousands of mails long .

If we 're planning for what we have then we are behind the curve " , Anthony Fox .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety then private transport is more likely to consider .
In certain emergency cases , running for a bus seems harder than jumping up in your own car .
Private transport is totally on your own , so there remains no tension of reaching a certain station on a specific time .
Travelling privately makes one free of the issues as harrasment .
Although many transport providers look forward to eradicate this problem , yet it remains .
Public travelling may trouble the passengers due to increasing fares .
People often tend to go on their own as private transport such as cars can be bought easily on loans provided by banks .
Looking on a wider span , cars are these days available according to the public demand .
The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer , convenient and comfortable mode of travelling .
Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps .
Perhaps someone had been killed , or kidnapped in the street
There was one old granny who was beat up .
We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that . Than we were trying to find help ,
but nobody was opening doors .
On our luck I had a mobile phone , but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner .
My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I 've done that .
After we came to the ambulance , police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us .
I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident .
To our relief , she was saved and when we went to granny room , we saw smile on her face .
We were also happy , but in Michael head came a lot of things .
He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground , she would most probably die .

I like a lot of activities such as travelling , readillng , play soccer and watch movies .
I still believe that public transport will be more popular in the future due to benefits it provides for us . Travelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Travelling pubic is cheaper .
On the other hand , not everybody can own the car .
Public transport is suitable for those who have no own car .
Besides , public transport will reduce traffice jam .
Today , government focus on how to improve public transport and they also increase their supporting .
This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball , you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie .
Shopping takes place the biggest part especially to women , but sometime it becomes not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality who does n't like crowds of people walking around .
Secondly , if you can not find what you are looking for , you will not beam with happiness .
What is more , you will not be satisfied with the shopping if you lack money and can not afford to buy the thing which you really want .
To sum up , I would like to say that , if you are in bad mood or lack of money then you will not be able to feel pleasure of it .
Human live has change a lot in the last years , and it seems that this will happened faster every day , the technology advances and the changes in the way of thinking , are adapting to a different kind of people with each human generation .
Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas like flying cars , smartphones with the size of a small paper , laptops really thin like quarter of inch , clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape , healthier food , smarter electrodomestics .
All this will help people to live easily , but only to have more time to work , because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it , this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient .
At the end , the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of live , but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more , also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland , forest and wetland is disappearing for some long - term human activities , for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment .
Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people , what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems , which is needed for more palce to living .
And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it ,
In order to command the psychology of user , it was necessary for me to know the new tendency of UI
Therefore , with the good UI design , many people will have the user experience with pleasure .
The good user experience will be good to collect data and be good for making a decision in commerce .
Once upon a time there was living a little girl in a small town .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarressed .
She dreamt about living in a big city where anyone would n't know her .
She had just wanted to hide from this world .
Lora has grown up and become a very pretty adult .
She has mooved to Kyiv , graduated from university and started to work .
Althought she tried to hide she has become a great and a famous model .
She has even got a boyfriend , Michael .
He was everything for her .
He loved her for her flame .
From time to time it seemed to him that he loved her .
But it was very short emotion .
Once Lora came and told him that she was sick .
Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of .
I had been following series of football 's events in and around the world at large .
I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship .
With all that , I do have my favorite club team n country as well .
My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia .
I know football does n't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best .
What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football , instead of them running around .
They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;"Barcelona does n't buy players"it 's not like , they are lacking money .
As normal humanbeings , you have to know how to spend money , where , when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it .
So , i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team .
The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world , you like or not .
I am writing about the international sports I have seen monthly magazine .
I enjoy this sport because it is comfortable and elegant also you never hurt yourself badly .
The advice I would give to someone who starting this sport .
first of all you should eat healthy food to have a good physic , do more exercises and sleep less .
Most people who play Tennis are always ready and proud about themselves .
I reach home at 13:00 then I take my lunch and relax for an hour .
we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy .
My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown .
I like also walking in public street , gardens , clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot .
I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future .
The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger .
It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight , try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport .
I want to begin with one thing : I do n't have a favorite sport or something on that , but I really like to do exercises for my body .
I think it 's important to maintain our tone and of course our health .
Because , when we practice a sport or some simple exercises we feel how the body receives energy , that it 's happening with me .
But we have concrete examples , which we should wear follow and which already demonstrated that nothing it 's impossible .
Like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi , they are two people which succeeded in their sport but with perseverance and ambition .
They are passionate by that they do , more concrete those are fall in love with their job .
It is an important thing to love and like a lot what we practice , because that it 's the key .
The pleasure and your will will help you to succeed and to get the best scores .
In my point of view , this subject , the sport , the favorite sport is one of most pleasant for me .
I love to do joking in the morning and then to do a lot of exercises for my legs and arms .
If I do that , now the day is one of my best days , it 's a managed day for me .
In conclusion , I do n't have a favorite sport , I like to do a little of all and I do n't refuse nothing .
This crime was happened about six years ago .
It was in Italy , exatly in Bergamo .
Yara finished one of your training .
Her parents , after an halp past hour of the training 's finish , became preoccupied .
Then , when she did n't return at home , her parents reported the passing of their daughter .
The surveys were concentraded above all in the construction site of Mapello .
In December 2010 , Fikri was banged - up by the police .
Three month after her passing , she was rediscovered dead along the stream .
Definitely , the public transportation does n't have any future .
A good amount of the population prefer to buy a car to go to the school , work place , church on a faster on comfortable way .
Every year thousands of car are sell and the demand is growing .
Probable the only opportunity to change this will be to remark on people the opportunity to save energy and diminish the environment contamination if we use public transportation .
It is not only entertains , but also educates .
There are many educational programmes which we can get penfit of it .
Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe , in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team , They are called " Champions League " and " Europa League".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody .
The people start to play football in a regulatory pitch , after some time they will be tired , but it is normal because their muscles are not enough strong for running around the pitch for many times .
If you often train your muscles will become very strong .
Another thing you do not have is the ball control .
The ball control is the control you have when you run with the ball .
you can improve it running with the ball and gradually you will improve your ball control .
How to make true mistake ?
I 'll tell you a story happened at school

Years ago , pollution was not a big problematic to deal with .
Our ancestors used to live in a unselfish life .
Nowadays , pollution is a plobelmatic that we have to solve before it gets worse .
A new way of transport mut be included .
We are used to driving a car and we do not notice how much damage we cause . We should start using new ways of transport as go by bike or by walking .
Not only will solve pollution , also it will help us to discard obesity .
We Should include new alternatives of transport in our routines .
We have no idea of how much damage factories causes to the rivers and seas .
In fact , the factories waste goes to the rivers .
The government should improve a new law to regularize this damage .
As we can see modernization is causing damge in rivers and seas .
In my opinion , Pollution is a problematic on the entire world , not only in modern countries , so we should try to recycle more , any kind of help is necessary .
Dear grandmother ,
These are white with black and blue lines .
I love it .
My mother gave me for my birthday .
I 'm going to celebrate my birthday next week in my house .
I am very happy because the time spent very fast .
I did n't have anything news about you .
You can come here when you have time because my house is your house .
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and after we will travel around my country and we will become a good workerds .
This idea is fantastic , although this will be very complicated .
However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job .
On the other hand , I do n't recommend travel because this is very expensive .
If you came here , you will see a lot of country and you travel around the world .
But it is your decision , these options are my advice .
I will look forward to your notice about your decision , but I am very nervous because if you are with me , I will have the best summer in my life and I will be very happy because we will do parties with a lot of friends .
You must remember that the money are very important in your decision .
And i went to open the door .
I was really comfortable in my bed i coudnt belive that someone interrupt my calm .
But , whatever , i wen .
To the door and open it , result that was my brother .
After that say hi and go with him inside , he told me that our mom was goon to a trip for a week and we have to take care of my little sister .
I was a little worried because i love my sister but she was younger and i had a lot of work .
Whatever i decided to said yes and prepared myself to take care of her .
My brother go and he promised to return later with my sister .
I closedthe door whishing never have to opened again , then i went to the bathroom and took a relax shoower .
I practise Pilates Method every Sunday morning .
I like this sport because it is a simply healthy sport that respects my body .
I practised danse a long time ago but with ages , I 've preferred to practise an easier sport .
I discovered Pilates 2 years ago and began with a old Bejar dancer .
He took time to explain each movement and made me understanding the concept .
After 10 times I obtained results on my body : stretch , sinewy and flexible .
If I could give advices to new practisers of Pilates , it should be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a goog teacher .
A few years previously I took part in one programme name called Christmas Drama .
In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports .
Because school teachers never encourage me to participate .
If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation .
While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character .
They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character .
And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven " O"CLOCK.DAY BY DAY I learn and finally I did my role well .
Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days .
Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are .
After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier .
The future of public transport in developed countries is very different , because most people have a car , in the people who live in poor countries , most people take public transport , because people does n't have a car and is cheaper take public transport , the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have , eco friendly transport .
I did n't use to believe in that people would do everything for advantage , even betraying family and friends .
I thought that was only seen in film .
The real world would not like that .
I strongly believed people would rather have love in the heart than everything .
I was n't rich , not having many good things , only a sample person , but I lived happily .
At least I had a stable job , lover , family and friends .
However , these things have changed , All the things I have been owning , building , remaining are broken .
It is hard to believe my eyes that I could see the avidity under their eyes , as if they could n't wait to see me dead , they ca n't become brilliant so long as I am alive .
I have always tried to convince them that I am not that bad some people said .
My family live in the city center of Madrid but I do n't like living here because it is noisy and there is contamination , so I decided to move to the county side two years ago .
I love this place because it is relaxing but the only problem for me is I live alone and I 'm lonely .
My mother knew my feeling and she wanted help me .
She came to my house with a present last week and when I opened it ... I could n't believed it " It was a little and beautiful monkey !
I was so exciting and very happy .
For me it was like to have a new member of the family and he lived with me .
Since these moment my life changed and now I go to every place with " Yango " monkey 's name
I am writing this letter in order to apply for the job in the " usa summer camps " .
To start with , I would like to tell you that I have studied gastronomy in the Instituto Crandon , one of the most recognised institutes in Uruguay , also , I have just finished the sports and health course in the Universidad de la Republica , in which I learned to work from children to adults in the sports area .
I think every people love sport .
In the world very famous sport festival is Olympic .
There included many kind sports such as wrestling , basketball , tennis , running .. etc .
My favourite sports are basketball and martial art .
First , Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of members of team and keep contact them for example my roll is cutter but i need to do assister , blocker and guarding when i play .
Secondly , Every country have own martial art history and culture that is kungfu from China , taekwondo from Japan and Karate form Korea .
It not just fighting these sport give people durability , speed and power .
Especially i like karate and Kung - fu .
Man and women whose are possible to interest it .
There is not special criteria such a tall and strong muscle or gender .
These 2 sports improving human basic ability to reach as possible high capability .
I suggested to other people first to understand yourself such as what do you like , which is possible and than practice after every success
my favourite sport is badminton .
it 's a game between 2 or 4 people .
they use a bat and a shuttlecock which is like a bao feather .
purpose score most points .
I think I am good player .
my first play badminton when I was 7 years old .
positives ways for playing badminton : you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc
negatives ways for playing badminton : you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime , you are sprain your arm .
I 'm sure is very heath for your body .
According to this form , we can know learning knowledges takes a part of time in one day .
Unlike Taiwan 's senior high schools students , their sleeping time average in eight hours even more .
As for me , my daily schedule do n't have much options , just only study , sleep and others .
Others include in rest and exercise , but they do n't occupy lots of time .
In my awareness , I know United States advocates free - style study and self - learning , so they aside from study , they have diversity selections .
When it comes to my sleeping , I only have four to five hours in a day .
The lake of sleep often maks me ca n't concentrate in class .
the more remind myself to get up early , the more things i need to do .
The only common option is rest time , I also spend three to four hours .
Because i think family and friends are my spirit medicine , they can give me lots of energy .
First , I am to say that People 's lives change in the future , because the new technologies will change the lives of people .
I think this , because the new technologies are created by people for improving our habits .
For example , Internet in the next 50 years will be very different , I guess that people will have a chip in our head and they may do many things with your mind like if we need to call other people , we will think about it and we may speak with it .
For other hand , People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution , for example , In this time we have created electric cars or organic food , these things are very useful in future , because we will need to reduce pollution .
Also , People will need to improve medicine to cure diseases and for this , People need to create more inventions to resolve these problems .
Finally , I think that the best change will be in our lifestyle , We will change our clothes , thinking and other things , We will be more dependent and we need more things for our day to day .
Although I have been having terrible jet lugged since came back my country , It 's great to see my family and my friends .
Anyway I have to find a bird to develop myself and take a rest .
I never say goodbye to everyone because I will come back England .

The door rang again and he opened again the door , his sister was with him and she was very scared but there was anybody in the door again .... and this time , the noise at the top of the stairs was higher and he understood all .
Someone was calling the door while that someone was stealing in your house ...

Twenty years ago I started playing football .
I had practised a lot of sports before , but when I started playing football I felt that was my sport , this was freedom .
I have played at a lot of teams .
And just as I was becoming in a proffesional football player , my right knee injured .
Then I have been operated twice .
Because of injuries , I have now thinking on leaving football to dedicate me to other passion , the guitar .
I prefer doing sport with a friend or my sister , it is funnier .
When you go owling you do n't need words , or worm or any thing but hope .
This book is written by Jane Yolen .
I like that phrase Because The boy was happy becaus he got to
go owling and he s been wonted to go owling for a long time and he finally got to go .
When other kids are happy that makes me happy . I like it Because it makes me feel good Because you do n't haf't
( have ) to have words to go owling but you haf't to have hope to see an owl .

Hi , Jenny
Well , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel , it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious , Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films .
This is one of my favourite actor because , when he is recording a film he assume his role passionately and that is really important for a good actor .
Another of my favourites is Will Smith , he appeared in the well - known film , Men in Black and others excellent films like I am Legend .
This is for me and many people an excellent actor because his personality is extroverty .
So Jenny , here are my two favourites film stars .
This topic has controversial opinion these days , That everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university .
I am going to study the topics from both aspects and give my opinion in the matter .
A good percentage of people think that everyone should take a year off between leaving school and start college .
They think that year the student can spend in job to earn money so they can afford their expenses during college .
This way helps them also to explore the job market , some jobs are in great demand compared to others .
Or simply the student can spend this time travelling .
This way help them to get rid of study stress , and to give time to their social life .
Others think that if students take a year off study is unwise .
As return back to study may be difficult .
It is better to finish study first then go for work or having relaxation with travel .
both opinion have their merits .
In my opinion I Think it greatly depend on individual financial situation .
As I you have monetary that can cover your expenses on travel is totally different than if you have to work to cover your expense .
Transport is very important in our life , because we transport from place to other places .
the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future ,
Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times .
Congratulations for your weding , I hope you will be all your life as happy as you are now .
Jenny and you are a great couple .
Thank you very much Joe for think in me for to be your witnees , I feel very proud that you think in me for to be your witnees and of course I accept and I will be in Toronto for your wedding .
Joe we live far away since I work for the red cross , but I steel be the same person as I was at the school and I like the same things .
Joe I have the same memory as I was a child , and I do n't remember to much Sophie .
Was she at the school with us ?
Could you describe me her ? .
In other way , I never be a witness , what I have to do ?

I will be at home for my mother birthday in november , and if you can we could have a drink .

hello , good morning
I enjoy my favorite sport because I like running , playing and go to the forest .
This sport is healthy and good for the body . you should starting this sport for you feel good .
your muscule will be hard .
for this is necessary drink water , eat fruit , vegetables and pasta .
we do n't chould eat sweet and sugar .
if you want to start this sport , you should start running thirty minutes .
Thank you for showing your interest in my village concerns with the environment .
The town , Lahori , has been known for its practices to preserve nature . in our town , we conduct monthly meetings concerning waste management , as well as pesticides .
We are very appreciative of Dr. Manjot Baqri , who has taken upon himself to lead these meetings and educate our village on health problems associated with improper dispose of the waste . the village has built pits to dispose waste .
The fact of using a cart to transport , is essential in life , and that depends on the car you want to buy and save gas .
When you drive you must take precautions at all times because if you can not cause an accident
Link Remember that a car is to make your life easier to transfer and save as a way also to bring security because you go in your car and is less likely to get mugged or something .
Some desventejas may not have the money to maintain it , and they always remember that the car should give you a service and not to him , which is why you always keep it in line with the engine so you do not fail .
One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city , he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism , he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another , he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city , he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go , he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors , then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of
In the era of technological advancement , everything goes beyond one 's expectation .
There are mobile phone which has a face to face communication ; the transportation driven by solar cell energy .
In addition , the advancement of transportation system which is developed day - by - day performs to the most convenient and the fastest as they can .
Even though the personal car was consumed more and more because of its convenient ; in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development will perform public transport to be more popular than travelling by car .
The number of people in the world is continually increased .
This makes the city be crowded .
Imagine if everyone has individual cars , may we walk on the top of the car to meet neighbour by the next door .
Therefore , public transportation is deemed significant in order to reduce density on the road , the traffic .
In the first paragraph , I 've written that the transportation development will never lose place for public transport .
Firstly , there are a lot of methods to travel ; for example , buses , trolley buses , Metro , BTS , train , ship .
Secondly , public transport improve itself to be more functional and help support people .
For example , comfortable seats , system support for the handicap or physical disability , time capture that help people to know the fix time when the bus come , as well as security support that help people to be more confident to travel .
Lastly , public transportation make you sure to arrive on time .
You do not worried about the traffic jam , or try to find the car park .
All taken into account , the public transport has a much more useful and convenient , both individuals and commercial .
Although the personal car is popular , the public transport is still be valuable for the country
Hope , You will be free at 6 a.m.
Let 's meet on John 's apartment .
Summer vacation is so desirable that those in school or workplace long for it .
To most students , weekend is essential to them , because they are not allowed to play computer games until the weekends .
In my opinion , weekend not only gives us enough time to take an adequate break but allow us to enrich ourself .
Similarly , summer vacation give us more time to do meaningful things .
Such as visiting museum , seeing touching movies , doing exercises and so on .
Only by constantly do conducting my daily routine can I learn more information and become stronge

Disaster on the environment not only cause many problems to human but also to all diversity of life .
As a part of diversity , people , therefore , seek ways to reduce cause and effects of these coming disaster .

Summer holiday ,
I have been to Italy on holiday 3 years ago .
I did n't have a long holiday , it was just for 3 days but these 3 days were the best in my life .
I must say that I went there because my sister is living there so I did n't have to book a room at the hotel and spending too much money .
I went to the Vatican and Rome , I saw their massive buildings which were impressive and their old houses .
The weather was fantastic , I love bathing in the sun and resting on the hot sand on the beach .

The moment perfect is when you want , in the morning , in the afternoon , in the evening or in the night .

In conclusion I 'd like to offer my aid if anything would be necessary .
Myth and fable are always my favorite types of stories , because they can either be easy to understand or extend deeper matters .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a story by discovering their background first , is n't it ?
For example , due to the wide spreading of " The Epic of Gilgamesh " , we all heard something relate to it , but do n't really know about details .
Amount of tradition and legend nowadays somewhat refers its context , such as Homer 's " Odyssey " , the flood mentioned in the Bible , and especially Mesopotamian civilization .
Therefore , I try to find out more information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusion , i hope that Riyadh city will be more interested in traffic jams .

My name is Andreia , I am 27 years old . I am a very friendly person and I have experience in this area .
Last summer I worked with children aged 10 years old during a month and I had organised some activities on the beach such as football games and gym classes .
I like very much to cook and I think that there are some activities that we can do on the kitcken , like to cook cookies or make fresh bread .
For another think I can speak English very well , because I had studied English in university although I was Portuguese .

Having used cars to fulfill our transportation needs within the city limits it is a very good option for many of us , however the necessity of travelling overseas or even outside of our suburban areas might require a different sort of transportation , therefore is where the public transportation should focus on since the long trips taking more than a simple commute in the city would require it .
It has been a popular American tradition for many years now , since the mid-60s that we all use cars owned by private parties in order to meet our needs , hence considered the " modus operandi " ever since .
A new thinking might help to address this issue : transportation itself , perhaps , it is in need of evolution , that might be the use of public transportation , it has proven to be the best manner to get to places which roads and geographical areas might happen to be unknown to the traveller .
Firstly , all people can buy a lot of type of some things in my city for example in the centre of the city we can be souvenirs because this town has got old monuments , theatre and churches .
In north of the city people sell all types of food .
Normally this food are made when people did in the past , although , the best street market is in the west of the city .
On the other hand , you should visit a bookshop in a street marker .
However you can read a book while you can eat and drink some things in the sofa of street .
You must remember that in the center of the city , you can visit the bakeries with the best sweets and bread of world and these sweets are cheaper than in other towns .
Finally , people can know the biggest shopping center of Spain , the situation of this shopping center is in the national street 445 in west of the city .
You can see modern clothes while you eat in a restaurant and you can take photos with a tv star , because they buy in this shopping center and you feel a star , because you see a famous person and you think that you are in a film .
The movie I decided to review for you is thriller called The destiny .
The plot of movie is set in a small town where everything has its own eyes and because of that you must be aware of your behaviour .
All it begin when daughter will come to visit her mother and her step father .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen but for your surprise it always turns up for something unexcepted .
Despite the fact that there is n't any holywood star all the characters are played very believable and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
Even the scenery is not based on real story it will makes you think about accidents happening around you .
There is n't anything special what I dislike maybe except for the music which was used there .
Sometimes I felt that the background songs do n't match with what was happening but after all you are in expectations of next step so you would n't mind it .
I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see happening unpredictable situations and likes the feeling of unknown .
The town is called white city .
Is a quiet and beautiful city with many things to do and a lot of places to go .
My fovourite place is the beach that is near , just about 20 miles away from my flat .
In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life , but majority of ones is totally utopic .
Everyone wants a particular objects and individual life , as an egoistic human being ; however the realm world hasn't capacity to support these ideas .
Actually , we have a lot of problem with traffic : lots of cars in the railway and it do n't running ; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution ; crawded railways causes a later destination .
In the biggest cities around the world the traffic nonstop and increase every day .
We descovery , in this perspective , special deseases by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , insecurity , so on .
For this reason , I believe that in the future we will return to use a green combuster and public transport .
If the public transport will be by higher quality , faster and fewer rates , majority of citizens will be prefer : is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one ; moreover , the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced , because it promotes less car in the railway .
Thus , in the future , public transport will be more interesting than particular and individual transport .

Nowadays , students have a lot of various form of education . They may not only learn in school but also through the Internet .
It has both advantages and disadavantages .
The main advantage of learning per Internet is time saving .
When we attend a school we often waste time on buses which we may intend to studying .
In case of Internet learning we can oneself set hours of learning .
Also , possibility of learning at home is a big advantage , especially for people who prefer peace and silence .
Then it 's better to concentrate of learning and we do n't feel any pressure or stress connected with asking and tests .
On the other hand , through the Internet learning on a long term we could feel bored or lonely , School gives opportunity of learning in group when students may help each other and resolve problems .
Another disadvantage of learning per Internet can be issue with Internet connection .

We are not alone . We live with people whome are family for us .
Relationship can be very different ?
from the best to the worst .
But sometimes we start to call our sisters and brother our enemy , without the reason .
Who brink up ?
Who care about us ?
Who try to make us happy ?
Of course no .
Our family is people who will love us , do n't look on situations and who we are .
We are always small and careless children for our parents , small and foolish for our elder brothers and sisters .
And i can clearly say that they are our friend . We are part of them and they are part of us .
Television and other things invented by tecnhology are part of our lifes .
I think every family has got a television in own home and for example I have 4 televions in mine .
For me television has advantages and disadvantages .
It 's important if we want to know news of our country or world 's news .
There are a lot of interesting tv programs where we can learn something and there are also intriging television programs .
These are advantages but we can have also disadvantages from them .
For example we can become addicted to our television .
It is not the best thing for our eyesight and our helth .
In general I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and tv and other similar things are responsable for our problems with helth and eyesight .
So television has positive and negative aspects and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
As keep our mind good and healthy we need to spend our some times in sport .

When I started to study here in Australia . I have been found the difference of curriculum in my home country .
In my home country , when I was in the University it has a little bit easy for me to follow the educational policies .
The learning style is a traditional learning that is usual thing in my country .
In addition , the type of examination is more on memorization , that I can use my own language that help me to understand it easier .
" In particular , many international students are too teacher dependent on uncritical of material that have been thought , prone to role memorization , they misunderstand the cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack of knowledge of the genres of academic writing " .
In contrast , to my present learning , it is precisely crucial .
The academic style is more on critical thinking , it is hardy to cope up , because I need to understand it using their language .
Clearly , multiple factors have had major influence or the nature of the student population , attending universities and now this shift affects , and is affected by university policy and practiced are important issue .
As an international learner , I embraced these changes in my learning strategies , primarily because these new learning strategies of academic style significant for my future course .
It has challenged me to adapt in a Universal approach to learning style back in my country .

I have a dream to continue my study until Phd .
However , I think that it is not an easy thing to be achieved because of the limitation about information of scholarship .
In addition , I work as civil servant who should follow the government rule .

In my opinion , education is a way to improve our life quality .
In other words , it can change our paradigm and mindset also into better perspectives .
In the broader capacity , it can help my nation 's position in the world perspective .
Therefore , I do not try to erase my ambition .
Everything is possible as long as we have effort .
travelling is an essential in everybody 's life .
Although the number of cars are increasing day by day , however most of the people traveled through the public transport .Their limited income restrict them to buy cars .
also the main drawback of cars is the environmental pollution .
Therefore public transport has its own importance .
In order to avoid the environmental pollution , people should use the public transport that will not only help to reduce the pollution but also the extra expenditures for the petrol .
government should focus for the improvement of public transport and must discourage the individual cars .
I 'm going to buy a DVD from ' Frozen ' .

Nuclear energy is one of most important source to generate energy and heat for the people in the world .
The countries diurnal attempts to develop the industry of nuclear to produce more power .
There are many views of using the nuclear power .
Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy .
Moreover , they think that controlling the pollution is possible .
Whereas .
The serious side of the nuclear power is the dangerous weapons that the countries try to own , threat the peace in the world .
These kinds of weapons do not kill one or ten but destroy a large town completely .
In my opinion using the nuclear power is important with the great development in the humans life.the countries have to establish this energy and other sources to secure the power for people .

By plany you rarely have problems with your luggage .
By train you did n't will have always place for your luggage .
By plane you can give your luggage at the check - in or you can take the hand luggage with you . you can be always sure that you will find a place for your luggage .
Another reason why travel by plane is my favourite is because it is more comfortable to sleep except you have a loud person close to you .
That can be annoyand .
I think travel by boat is one of the baddest ways to travel when you are seasick .
You can eat small pieces of different dishes and to have dinner or lunch inexpensively .
For more than thirty year in Nerja has been openend every day " Big Fish " a traditional restaurant with a typical cook of the coast of Málaga .
With your drink the first portion is on the house .
If you pay between one and three euros you can choose little dishes of fresh fish and different types of salads .
The portion of prawns is very famous as octopus salad , which is known by everyone .
The service is very organised and fast , although it might be in high season you would not have to wait a long time .
This restaurant only has a little problem .
You can eat " tapas " at the counter or in small tables near the bar .
The rest of the diningroom is exclusive by eating meals .

My favourite sport is football , I love it .
I enjoy play it , particularly because it is a competitive sport and because you play with a team and not alone , and this for me is really important .
The thing I like best in football is play it , but I also like watching it , intact I am a fan of the team Lazio .
Some people think that the football is a bad thing because the footballer are all stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , but it is n't like it .
Ok there are some fans who are n't good people but the most important associations of football are trying to stop they and to abolish all bad things in football .
For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun .
As every year the twenty three of April , day of book , in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift .
the gifts usually are a book and a ticket for the theme park in Madrid , and the children who have participated win a book .
Always the director of my school , called Michael , is who organizes this event for that the children have fun writing his shorts stories .
But this year , Michael is organizes very evil because he does n't enough books for all children and a lot of they had n't gift , so Michel had closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I think my town really take care of the environment , because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean .
However some people are not care of environment that mean some people throw garbage away in the park .
I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having lunch , picnic , excersise , nap etc .
I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good .
Even though do not everyone doing that , so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot .
Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude .
When I am walking around here I can see a lot of beautiful gardens and roads are clean so I think many population are care of town as well .
There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort , football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time .
Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health .
However someone have to take care of them .
The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around , so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment .
After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed .
pain and gain
This movie is bases quote on quote on a " true story " buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie , its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties , which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him , and eventualy police get him .
Its a great funny movie especially for someone like me who enjoys going to the gym and lifting some weights .
It is a very beautiful T because -shirt I like the colour and the pattern .
We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben , which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye .
To got to the Big Ben we took the underground , but to get to the London Eye a red bus .
After 3 days we went home .

It make me lose weight easily without doing any effort .
I do n't find any difficulty in doing it .
Usually I only play basketball in school .
We play by teams or each one alone .
Of course we do n't have 2 million balls for each student no we share with each other .
Also , not all the school play in one time no every section have time to play in .
In school I always play with friends never played alone and always my friends and I wins .
Last time I played when won 14 by 5 .
do you know do I enjoy my sport I will tell you why because when you play you have fun and interested .
My advice for people who is starting this sport is to repeat playing until they get it .
My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I remember to watching it at home at the age of twelve and laughing out lous with my brother .
My favoutite character is Joey , who is a silly innocent man .
He live with Chandler , opposite Monica and Rachel 's flat .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life , definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we ca n't create successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities .
One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society .
Consequently , they probably fail to experience from their live .
Moreover , families take an essential part in protect their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflect on their perfotmance toward country .leading to effictive , creative and useful civilians .
the last film I wachd was " the oders " by it is a horror / suspense movie , I was really scared .

and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders .
At the end theintruders turn out to be ghosts that

I think nowadays is more common that people use their car for their normal activities , but the statement that there ir no future for public transportation it is not completely true , I think that a lot of people use public transportation because it is cheaper and some people do n't have enough money to buy a car .
Another reason is that here in Mexico , in some cities you ca n't use your car in specific days , so if you do not have another car , you have to use public transportation .
Well , my college has been provide an organization called Enactus .
I 'm a member on it and its goal that improve the positivity of our society by setting projects serves many people who really needs our help .
So , we actually done 8 projects since i came in and i had a good feeling through helping other people .
we interned 2 national Competitions in 2 years and won second place on one of our projects and gained 2 leagues on other ones .
we made our university proud plus helping people .
Now , we are over 180 members in this organization and getting increase .

Nowadays , Ways of live have being Changing in many aspects .
Does why , is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything , in a closer future of 50 years everything is gon na be completely knew and different .
In the past , people were used to live the instant without concerning about the future .
Lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future .
For that , everything were kind of similar and static for many years .
But then industrialization comes and with that , the technology , so ways of life 's started to change and everything start to go faster .
As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time , and with the pass of the years this tend to increase .
For example , sharing knowledge and experiences allows that everybody can do or apply things and develops faster .
Also allows that researches can be share easily or for example you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as we 'll so you can react faster and make some changes .
Another example of why lives are gon na changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health , the expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life .
As a result we will be need to change fast , to try to fix what we broke and star to rebuild in order to have that future or health that we dream of .
Least but no less , family perception , has being changed and for that time everything will be different because will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kinds .
They are tending to work as much as men 's , so is hard to have time for building a family or even some times is hard too , thinking about getting married .
So that , maybe would n't be young force worker in 50 years and people will spend all their time and money in their hobbies , sports , self care and traveling .

On the one hand society become increasingly fat and kinds of warnings could be useful to remind them to eat clean .
On the other hand it 's hard to implement this idea .
The companies who produce products with harmful ingedients are very mighty so that this suggestion is very hard to enforce .
The example on cigarette packets shows that warnings like this could be useful .

As all of us know that today 's generation prefers everything to be their own .
An in the process of owning we have moving so ahead that a day will be there when we will strongly claim that public transport does not have any future .
As our country is developing there will days were each and every individual will be self reliant and would definitely prefer having their own vehicle to commute from one distance to the other .

Nowadays the public transporte is n't hardly necessary for our life .
However , a lot cities have a problem about traffic , cause of this trouble that citizen do n't use public transporte such as autobus , taxi , or even metro .
Consequently , gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte .
Moreover it 's not only traffic 's problem but also bad condition .
Much toxic and exhaust flow to air .
How can we recover the pubilc transporte .
People are unpleasant because all of them have bad quality , so government ought to update new technology which protects the environment .
Now , the car price is very low 's cost so it very easy to buy a car .
The recenty years before , a family had only one car but today we have a car for ourselves .
Waiters are always smiling and they are very nice .
They wear black and white clothing like the decoration of the etablissment .
And for spring and summer they open a beautiful and large terrace .
The baking of the meat is excellent .
This restaurant should be the best for our class .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , have a sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake are so many concerts so you have the difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the scouls are closed per ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have much time to spend the
in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used , ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece ways of traveling around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion , it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly .
public transport is used by many people around the world , including me .
Some public transports as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes .
Many people said that public transport is not confortable , that s true , from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable .
Many people like going by car , but it pollute a lot more than going by public transort.public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motorbike , it also contamiate less than these .
Public transport is also used by childrens like me who want to go to school , high school or to the univerity .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some little disadvantages , it 's also very usefull for some people .
In my opinion public transport souldn't dissapear .
I like to spend time cute little kids and cooking is my favourite hobby .
In the evening I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them .
I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I have some busy or tight scheduled work , I have come across your advertisement For this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every aspect because I have a friendly move with people in and around me . I would be pleased to know for your positive reply .
My town tries to take care of the environment but sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have any conscience of the need of good environment .
Neither they do n't seem to take care nature and all around it .
For instance , My town have a lot of mountains with big forests , tall trees and many types of animals or plants .
However , that is n't protected by government and its institutions .
Local Parliament haven't regulated principles or rules of the environment , then ecosystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminate and pollution had reised inside my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions have allowed that some foreign enterprises or corporations could to take our own resources without demand that they be careful with environment .
This is clearly a symptom of how inside my town does n't care any element of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade some neighborhoods have taken conscience on their context .
In this way , we can to see inside them that their population have so much control and they know that affect them .
Good management of the rubbish is a new inclination in many neighborhoods of my town .
Recycle plastic , paper , cardboard etc , by poblation of the most important neighborhoods of my town is a way to improve the environment .
My favourite sport is box because it 's the only sport that can relax me .
In my opinion this sport teaches to mature because in addition to set up the person physically , it instructs the mind .
I begin this sport for 2 years ago .
My brother was win so much fight and when i saw him proud i want to try that .
I do n't know what i can tell .
Must people prefer large colleges more than small colleges for many advantages .
First , the majors offer numerous and diverse .

It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers .
In addition , it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees , university housing , hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too , and a big library has many books in various languages .
Besides that it availability some services like transporting for students and faculty , some restaurants , and mini market .
In addition , the location of large college is clear and the center at the city , so that easily accessible .
In the end , large colleges admit largest number of students , so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities , also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors .
Once upon a time there was a boy his name is Michael .
He had a very beautiful brown hair , Green eyes , and perfect smile .
Michael loves to play football all the time .
Someday he woke up early at the morning he go out for playing football before school , when he 's playing he saw something running very fast and go away .
He 's back home for getting ready for school when he 's try to forget what he saw , but he ca n't .
after school he did n't go to his home directly to check if what he saw at the morning was real or not , but he did n't find anything .
Next day he woke up early too not to play football but to take a look if this stranger will come back this morning . and he saw it again .
he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one , and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid .
The stranger was looking for a food in the street to take it to his family .
we visited the Tower of London , Buckingham Palace and the wax museum .

This becomes the concern of the employers since it may impact on the students ' learning outcomes .
TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug .
A new substance , called CPH4 , bound to be distributed around Europe and the United States by which plenty bag was set into her stomach having an illegal clinical surgery .
But everything became out of control for the criminals when one of her captors kicked on her abdomen , the substance spilles through her body and she begins to experience a different state of consciousness in which she dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almost 100% of his capacity .
During this time she contacts Samuel Norma , PhD Professor of University , to ask him what happens if a person reaches the 100% of his mental activity or IQ .
It is a gripping film , starring by Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman in a quite good playing , that will you keep tense until the last scene and does n't leave you feel unpasible .
Nowadays people are using own cars instead of public transport , this effect is more obvious in big cities where the price of public transport cost more than small cities .
Pople are getting used to drive with their own car , it provides more confortability , and is more practical .
You can use it whenever you want , and it 's not necessary make a long queues at metro or bus stations .
The government are opposing to invest in public infraestructures , because the benefits are lower every year .
They are preferring to invest in public roads and motorways .
The impact of this fact has a huge consequences in the climate effect , in the futre the global pollution will increase according to the level of the cars .
The travelling by car it 's very bad .
With the public transport we protected the environment .
The pollutes it 's a global problem .
If we will travel by car have more pollutes that with public transport .
Otherwise , the public transport pollutes less that the car but the car it 's very comfortable and not be hour hard .
With the car I feel more free as I do n't depend to other people for move to the site .
I believe that in the future all transport will be with the public transport or least with massive transport .
The actual system is not possible stand long time .
Recently I saw the trailer of the film about vampires .
The girl is 18 years old and men ( as it later turns out ) are vampires and they have over 100 years .
He falls in love in her .
Then there is the older brother of the boy ( vampire ) and also falls in love in her .
This trailer I like and I think that the film would be cool .
He had to buy a present for his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution .
A few hours , he was walking by a garden , and suddenly , he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen , so he picked them up .
However , flowers were n't enough so he decided to think in anything else .
If you do n't want to pass this situation , you must always do things with time .
In my thougths , i have the opinion the public transport is better to the enviroment because going in the public transport reduce the CO2 emissions and take out traffic from the streets .
Reducing the rush hours in the main hours cause a CO2 reduction in the air .
it is a true statement about cars , travelling by car is so much more convenient and the new tecnologies apply to the
People should take less fast food and do regular exercises for maintaining a hgealthy life .
Many of us do not get enough time in the morning , to prepare our lunch for the office .
Easy availability is also tempting us for fast foods .
University education is good for the students but they also need to learn industry specific skills .
Students , for example learn many theories , which may not be required at their place of work .
In my opinion , what is expected is a new role for teachers but not their disappearance from classrooms .
At university level , availability of IT training , software and manuals provide an ever accessible source of information , that otherwise would not be at hand .
For example , India has high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embrassment of being Indian .
Nowadays internet represents the whole knowledge that people have collected over the centures .
So it provides a lot of interesting information , one of which are about how works different machines what can be found at www.howstuffworks.com .
Also ' internet ' in our days helps to get information all over the world , and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life .
One day i decide o buy news paper .
When i was arrived at home , i was started to read the news paper , so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition , and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest .
Michael was told me he was knew about this contest and at that moment he want to call me to ask , if I am able to came with him at that contest .
After I decided to go with him at the contest , I was thinking to go at that contest next year to participate and win that contest , so this year I was wondering how is the program .
When we were arrived there , the emotions started to appear so definitely it was time to drink a hot coffee , before the contest is started .
I was wondering if Michael pass that exam .
After Michael was opened the door from the classroom , I was saw in his eyes something strange .
When I opened the door imagine my surprised by what I saw .
I could n't believe in my eyes ...
When we came back in our dressing room , " Golem " waited for us .
" Golem " as we all know , are magical creatures , made from mud and having black rocks for the eyes , which can be brought to life by a incantation .
So , we were trying to save time until we managed to escape , but Niall did n't make it to escape , as they caught him when he stumbled and fell down .
Now , " Golem " hold him hostage in their cave , which is hidden somewhere in Los Angeles . "
I looked at them trying to think of something to do and then I said : " Come on boys , WE are going to SAVE Niall ! ! ! ! "
We took all we needed and started the searching for Niall ... We went in all caves in Los Angeles , but we could n't found them .
One night , which we were sleeping in our car , by mistake the car started to move and we woke up in a huge cave , out of Los Angeles .
I could n't believe in my eyes , we found Niall .
Then , we got out of our car and save Niall , after we were fighting with " Golem " and came back home .
Recently , an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenient .
In my opinion , public transport will still exist in the society .
Firstly , for the long - distance , the car is not as convenient as airport .
for example , if you go to another city by car , you may spent more than two days on the way .
On the contrary , airport just cost your two hours , and you can go to your destination .
The time spending of taking airport is lower than taking car .
Secondly , consuming car is not a normal thing for part of developing or undeveloped country .
The fee of buying car and fuel oil is expensive for poor people .
Thus , it is important to use public transport because it is much cheaper than private car , and everyone can consume .
Thirdly , the global warming is a serious issue for human who live in the earth .
Air pollution is the main causes for global warming .
The great number of using private car leads to higher level of air pollution , and the public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution .
To sum up , there are numerous benefits to use public transport , and it will not disappear .
Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet , We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation :
In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown , currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that 's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply , in order to let the plane market blomm .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choisses like cars , motorbikes , busses , train but also as we were talking about , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used is the car thus most of the families has one , but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet .
As we were talking , the new ecological movement is every time more powerful and charismatic , due to that , bikes are also increasing their role in the new age , there are also linked to the new fashion way to be hipster .
In conclusion , we are assisting to a new tend in transport , every time , they are faster and more developer , with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case , we find also a contradiction , as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth
I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation ; however , there are serious problems come after it ; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future for public transportation will be more proferous .
Many thanks for your message ,
when you can , you call me .
Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city
later if you want we could fiand a job for three months , in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer .
also I believe that a good job could be lifeguard , because in summer the people go to the beach and they need lifeguard .
If I were you I would choose lifeguard because the lifeguard earn much money than the waiters .
If you want we could go to the capital city of my country , we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train , we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall .
I am looking forward to see you
best wishes

Interstellar is a new Christopher Nolan 's movie which includes the participation of some Hollywood 's stars such as Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon .
public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries , using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car , to avoid this a good roadways is needed , also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation .
on the other hand , public transportation takes more time to get to the required station , because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it , and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time .
for that reason using own car is more comfortable than public transport , you can travel when ever you like and where ever you want .
finally , in the near future most peoples will be using their own car , because it saves much time as comparing with public transport and time factor will be more expensive in the future .
On school days , I get up at 5 a.m. and go jogging in my neighbourhood in 15 minutes .
After school , I keep running on a track field to be an athlete on a school sports team .
In the rainy season , it is boring to do rehearsals as nobody is on the field .
I come back home on the sunset .
However , I ca n't go to bed early because I have to prepare my homework for tomorrow 's school .
My favourite day it is Saturday because I do not need work or study , so I can go out with my friends and on Sunday I can wake up very late

I wake up early like 7 am , at this moment go out to the backyard to turn on the boiler , then go to kitchen
Nowadays , people live in very modern and fast society and try to have as convenient life as it is possible .
One of the many possibilities , how do our lives more convenient is to use cars rather than public transport .
Firstly , I like to mentioned public transport 's types .
The most common are bus and train , but in the cities people can use tram , subway or boat and for the long distance they can take a flight .
From my point of view , the main transport disadvantages , which caused our lives discomfort are time and place limitation , sharing the space with others , lack of free seat .
On the other hand , people should think of the environment , pollution , global warming , which all are currently warning .
We should think of our better future and try to behave environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge pollution , which is by cars caused and do n't think only to our comfort .
In my birthday 's day , I directed go to school this morning . I wonder whether my birthday passed it at lunch time .
At this point , someone invites sing to me , after school , he / she and I went to dinner and went to sing .
To the KTV , they touched to me because there are a lot of people had planned a birthday celebrate to me together .
After finish to the home , due to I was so tired that I fell asleep and fell down .
The next day , I was reluctanted to rise and class .
Suddenly , I thought of my gift was gone in the class , the students said he / she did n't take , but I doubt them , so we quarrel .
I came home from school , only to found a gift on the sofa .
Ioffer an apology out of harm students , but fortunately he did n't got angry for me .

I think you should save money for the future , because you may have to buy something importantwith your own money .
In my opinion , there are more important things than computer games , so spending money for them it 's like wasting money .
In the future you 'll have to spend a lot of money for the university , the new home and so on , and I think you should start saving money . I should do it too but it 's not simple , actually .
Actually , where I live the public transport is highly used , It seems that in the near future they wo n't disappear .
In fact in some countries overdeveloped may will extinguish because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
But , that future is very far for our actual situation .
Collecting book is my favourite pastime .
I started my hobby when I was a chid .
The first item in my collection is ABC book .
And now , I have a lot of books of all kinds : biology , chemistry , novel , dictionary , etc .
Now I have about 100 and more in future , I hope that .
Whenever I find an interesting book I buy it immediately .
Sometimes , my family and my friends gives me book such gifts .
This is the first text I would like to write on this website . I think this is a good idea to contribute to English language research and improve my skill at the same time .
As this is my first time , I would like to find out how exactly does the system work , so I chose to write this random text rather than those serious topics available .
Public transport is more convenient than cars , many ways.when we use public transport that benefits many ways .
Maintaing cars are expensive .
Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling , checking tyre pressures , getting tired after driving long journey .
In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people .
Elderly people wo nt able to drive always depends on public transport .
If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will affect a lot .
Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well .
As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive , so you are looking per house least 3 cars , so imagine how busy our roads will be .
As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever , price go up and down .
In summary public transport is important for our community and people has to raise their concerns regarding this .
Stopping public transport not going to gain anything rather than impact will be unpredictable .
I think sport is a good exercise for need to exercise people , I have a suggestion that want to have good health , choose a interest sport and try to play it , let it be a regular thing , it 's will be fun and health your physical constitution .

public transport has advantages and disadvantages.i will start with disadvantages .

I recommended all the people who wants to run that if you do n't feel like you 're improving anyway keep going and whit the time you will see results .

This is an introduction for how to make bank notes .
The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists .
Then there are some requirments for printing sheets : color on both sides , special ink and images slightly raised .
The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories : good quality sheets , patially damaged sheets and bad sheets .
The qualified and nit damaged severely sheetes are supposed to be packagd and distribued , which will be cut into separate bank notes , packed and then dispatched .
On contrary , other failed sheetes will be disposal and destroyed with band notes in a secure way .

When I was a little girl I used to play volleyboll and I really liked that .
One day I had a surprise , I have met a teacher and he invited me to tranee in a huge gym in a team .
I started to think that was born for that sport .
I worked too hard , but enjoe playing really .
Sundully happanned sonething , I need to work to play my studuies in the High school , so the life changes anyway , I needed to stop my favourite sport , because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me .

The line graph shows the U.S. cigarette price in dollar related to cigarette consumption in billions of packs from 1970 to 2006 .
The hugest gab is in 1981 where is the cheapest price combined to the highest expanditure of cigarette packs in the whole interval .
Roughly in 1998 we can notice an equibrium price at 2,75 $ and an equibrium quantity at 23 billions of packs .

My English is great level and speaking is my favourite part of learning English .
World is progressing rapidly , day by day there is a new ways of transportation , there is a new technology .
From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient for him .
So that , transportation was one of the most important issues faced human , because it is related to the interaction between people like trading and many other purposes .
From this point every human have the ability to buy a car and also buy his rest he will not hesitate to do it .
It is claimed thatour lives will improve in the next fifty years .
But we do n't if this change would be good or bad , I hope that will be good but let 's talk about it .
Fistly , i 'd like to talk about employments , i think that these are the most important thing to worry about , if our studies get better , we will create more employments and as a result the economical situation of the country will be better .
Moreover , our capacity fosr learning more lenguages seems to be really adequate unfourtunatelly while there are a lot of teenagers that are getting prepared really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
I think it is probable that in some years the tecnology could have improve quite a lote , and this is a very powerful advantage for us , the young people .
Beacuse we were borned in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclution , i 've got to said that now we do n't have to worry about the future we just have to carry on in present and do it the better we can .
Hi Alex!h How are you ? I heard that you went out with Mike !

It talks about a little girl who went adopted but she is 35 years old in reality .
Nowadays the public transport system are running out of passengers due to heavy use of personal transport such as cars and bikes.in early 1990 the public transport systems were most popular trans port system across the world because , most of the peoples had not their own vehicle . but in late 1990 most of the people were able to buy their own vehicle due to many financial institute which has various loan facilities .
today many people use their own vehicle for instead of public transport , the other thing is , it is easy and convenient way to travel to the job and any other personal work . therefore , it can be seen the demand for public transport getting low and lover .
In conclusion , it is true that the demand for the public going down rapidly as thy have their own vehicles .
however , even though everybody has their own vehicles they will have to use public transport once the roads are full of vehicles .
My favourite sport is football , and I enjoy because I love football players .
I had the opportunity to meet more about this sport .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream , many ca n't get what they accomplished those players today are very famous
You can learn with your referee and with coach .
Some people prefer play together but also there competition between players .
I think that this class discussion could n't true .
In the future people 's live had better .
Providing that we care the environment .
If we live well , we will be more carefully with world .
Otherwise everybody wanted a future better .
Nowadays there are a lot of things that we doing the live easier .
In order that if I were you , I would live well in the next 50 years .
I 'm looking forward so people will have more interesting by this case .
For instance , my family do n't think that will happened in the next 10 years .
They live at the moment .
Besides they said that in all the moment : ' Carpe diem ' .
This is other opinion .
my family consists of 5 members - my father , my mother and tow brothers .
my father is a business man .
he is 65 years old .
he works in real state investment .
my mother is a teacher .
she is 50 years old .
she is working in primary school .
my older brother is 30 years old and he is working as accountant for radio and television union in Cairo .
the younger brother is 25 years old .
he is a dentist .
he is doing master in turkey these days .
the last member is me , I 'm Aeronautical engineer in Qatar .
I love my family but everybody staying and living in different place or country .
the best brother for me is the second one who is a dentist .
he is my best friend and brother .
I hope if I can living with him in the same place .
he is very helpful and collaborator .
we spent a fun time in the beginning of our life when we were kids .
they spent their life helping us to be good men .
my older brother helped us in studying , but he is older than me by 10 years , so the relation between us is n't strong .
Anyway i 'm very happy to write for you .
This assertive is totally false .
The expansion of public transport is one of the keys saving the planet , especially if the energy source used come from clean sources .
Nowadays , the use of vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel is the main cause of air pollution in big cities around the world . Researches show that the private cars are used most often carrying few person at a time , what makes it very inefficient considering the quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic substances expelled to the environment each time that the engine is started .

In my opinion I think that the increase of teenage crime is because their parents do not put limits to them , and how not pay attention , they make all kinds of serious mistakes .
Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy , but I do n't know what kind of job can be , because a person who commit a crime is n't going to do something to help society like communitarian service .
I was sitting calmly ina cafe , when I heard it ringing .

Luckily it was my colleague Jane who wanted to drink a cp of fresh coffee with me .

when you talk with someone have you ever thought in your words before you say it ?
a lot of us never think before they speak and that is not good thing to do .
you must think a little bit before you talk as one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not actually notice that but you will feel what am really mean if someone tells you a painful words .
it is clear that everyone is ought to make a mistake without even noticing .

Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ?
he said bad words that he will regret saying these words .he went to his room .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

I do n't like the public transport of school .
I prefer travel in the car or motorbike , i am feeling security .
In my family travel in the taxi , because the taxi is fast and secure .
Today I felt bad in the public transport .
It was solwly .
Also i can see the air pollution is tallest .
Compared car or bus , the car is the most expensive than bus , because the car is comfortable and faster .
The taxi so it is .
In the morning , I go to the school in bus with my brothers but they get out earliest .
I prefer travel in the car .

There 's no discussion which is my favourite restaurant in town , The Seaside . I will tell you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class to take our last farewell there .
Our class has reformed over the years , with great classmates leaving and coming we have always been welcoming about it , and not at least towards the new ones .
It 's not necessarily to be nice and keen to everyone but our class actually is , in the weekends the whole class gather in different events together .
What I just told is what the restaurant Seaside means to me . Welcoming .
At the Seaside 's you are genuinely welcomed at the first doorstep , they accept you whoever you are .
This makes th
It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge , Jimena , commissioned a task to his students , saying :
-To Begin with this course , I want to be sure they know the meaning of art , pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves , without any specific technique , only your imagination , with it you explain to me what it is art .
His excited students began coming to their homes with such work , since they had only 4 days to perform their duties .
After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures , portraits of people , large sculptures , to a student , her name was Sandra , she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , old in which only had a name written in a style different letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner , can see that nobody understood the real meaning , since art is different for each person , each creates a different definition , so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art .
A student that really moved him , and reflect so apologetic , and out of the room , closed the door and Michael knew then that he had made a mistake .
my favorite sport it affects me greatly.i'm a kung - fu player .

Hello to every body ! !
Now I 'm going to talk about the benefits o learning another language .
I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish
I start to study another language when I was a child , I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language , when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me .
I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that 's great .
And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language , because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great .
I think learning other language never have drawbacks because all you learn is good for you and your main , you never stop to now new things .
These days , most of the people feel comfortable to travel through car and then they believe that public transport is not going to be sustain for longer time .
However I do not agree with them because in most part of the world mass transport system is still popular and they are environment friendly and cost efficient .
Firstly , Public bus service is very popular in most part of the world .
In most part of the Europe , people still prefer public bus instead of car to travel .
Secondly , public transport are environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicle .
It carries more people while private vehicle carries fewer people .
Public bus do not let more cars to contaminate environment .
Finally , Public transport 's cost efficient .
People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , although car is convenient to travel , it is not enough to finish the future of public transportation .
In the towns of the future , the care of the environment is one of the most important thing .
People have conciencied themselves that we need to respect the nature and the human places where we live .
Human beings have destroyed our environment along the time and now , the earth is in danger .
First place we need to care about is our near place , the town .
I like to take out the trash every night and I try to recycle my trash throwing it in different bags .
I have recently bought an electric car in sustitution of my traditional car .
An electric car is less harmful for the environment .
When I go out to the camp , if I lunch there , I take care of cleaning the ground .
I like nor the dirty people neither the dirty places .
I hope to live in the future in a clean town and I 'm sure that the most of the people are now thinking in this way . We need to care of our town because nobody like to place into a dump .
Military service is the military training which needs people have to join army or voluntary for a period of time .
In Korean , people should completed military service at least 2 years .
Similarly , people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan .
It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old .
With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity , whilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice .
Firstly , every countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security .
If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country , they can not get help from other countries immediately .
Therefore , people accept military service could be easier to protect their country .
Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country .
Secondly , the important for people become maturity when they completed military service , which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old .
In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills , people also can improve personal quality in military service .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong , they seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service .
In contrast , opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old .
Military service mainly to improve physical , however study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere , people usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .
For instance , some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished .
Additionally , critics argue that countries are able to allow people have freedom of choice for military service .
Relatively some people unwilling join military service , people volunteered in a military service possibly enjoy it .
Furthermore , it also can respect for right s of people , especially for women who do not can adapt the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people improve themselves .
The best course of action would be government attempt to allow people volunteered in conscription when they completed their studies .

And they have act to protect it .
I was in a museum of New York looking at all the beautiful paintings and sculptures , when I hear the alarm of the museum everyone was afraid including me .
The police was chasing the bandit that stole a painting , but he escaped instantly .
I went to my apartment and turn on my TV and I watch in the news that the bandit escaped with 3 paintings .
I went to the museum and follow all the tracks that I found were a broken sculpture .
I search for any clue and I found something , it was a piece of paper with an address on it .
I follow the address and when I get there it appears to be an abandon house .
I decided to wait , and hide on the bushes if I see someone entering .
In the night I see a shadow entering the house .
I carefully approached the window of the house and I see two men with the paintings .
They left the house on a truck .
I follow them in a taxi .
We were on the terminal of New York it was a very famous landmark .
There were a lot of commuters on the terminal so I lost the two men .
I located the instantly because I recognize their hats .
I was focal to them .
They threaten all the people cruelly so all the sightseers were angry with them .
However the modernization of the terminal was unknown to me so I was completely lost .
We entered on a train , the ceiling was comfortable but everyone was objecting of the two men .
When we arrived we were on the other side of the city of New York the features were so common because it was a good economic and conveniently because would attract more tourists .
I finally trap them their names were Lucius Fowley and Bob Parker I tell the police and the police put them on jail .
And the paintings were on the museum again .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do somethig immediately .
Today is a very important day for the sake of his future .
The watch shown the time is 9.30am and 2 hours left before he go to the place that made his heartbeat so fast .
He have an interview for getting the scholarship so that he can pursue his dream to study medical in Ireland .
He went to the station bus to ride on bus .
He took a few minutes for walking to the station bus from his house .
After the bus arrived he ride on and half an hour he arrived to the destination .
When he took a few steps from the bus he saw a very tall building that the interview places located .
After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely with high confident level he walke to the office .
Suddenly his water floaded and tears drop from his eyes .
The interviewer who is sitting infront of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loves .
Peter without doubt hugged the intertiewer who is a man about 4o years old .
The man who is crying together with him was his father that have leave peter and his mom because they had divorce 6 years ago .
Then the interview became a meeting between father and a son that really touched .
Killed two birds with a stone is a perfect idiom to describe Peter 's situation because he got his beloved father back and still can pursue his dream to studies in ireland.q

Hello ! I am begin to study technical English .
I want to this course , it helps me to enlarge my vocabulary .
Would you like to improve this course with me ?
Please , writes me a list with the words when I need for technical konversation .
I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " The Crazy Cat " this is a very good restaurant .
first the restaurant have wide variety in his food .
The chef can make the menu of the day to the dinner or you can choose a special menu .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed corn to start , beef medallion covered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts and the dessert chocolate cake with cheese .
the atmosphere is also very good has music in live with different bands .
you can choose two bands of rock or pop and one dj .
the cost is accessible .
The pack have a cost of $ 350 a person .
Can a TV programme get to entertain and educate at the same time ?
People complaint about how the information about different TV shows do n't contribute in the process of learning , that 's why many of This programmes are considered trash , because of the multiples shows such as realities , talk shows , or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people .
A good example of this shows are how people are paid to act in realities or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious familiar problems , where the only aim is to get more audience .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that are appeared recently , this type of programs where the information is often gossip about personal life of famous singers and actors without taking into count if they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that exist just a few programs that try to educate people with the most update information through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help to acquire more knowledge .
Knowledge that sometimes are unknown even though it is part of the general culture or proper of the history of our country .
I think in the future do n't exist public transport because we will drive their car .
When you drive your own transport , a car for example , you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school , work ...
It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person . I know some people , the drivers , began haven't got work , but the public transport is free and is free because it is the government pay , this money bacame do to make more work for others .
No all is good some people haven't got money ca n't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more , it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people , the solution is buy an electric car , the other solution , more economic , is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car .
I do n't know what is better no public transport or public transport .
There is no future for public transport since everybody prefer to use their own car .
now time is valuable for every body nobody bothered about money .
traffic is very high in now days so it will be difficult to reach office on time .
public transport is always crowded so it is not comfort to travel
Find your joy in scary movie
I would ignore thriller films due to my fragile heart , but my mind is changed now after watching this film .
The film is entitled " Scary Movie " which is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans .
This story was shown a murder who completed the mission : killed everyone that he hated .
At last , only one person could be alive even those sacrificed had tried to escape this horrible result .
This is a combined story of horror and comedy .
I can not find a word to describe this film easily , what can I say is you will be regret if you miss this film .
This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly , this essential element which also makes a big success to the film .
Besides , the attractive story line makes a lot of climax so that everyone can finish this film from the beginning to the end and creates the billion box office to this film .
However , I think the tools should be improved , such as killer 's knife and actors'costumes , the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft , I believe those are seconded - handed clothing . I think this is a pity to this movie .
At last , your bravery can be improved after watching this film .

I 'm studiying medicine , this major is too challenging although stressful , because the self - study is every day and there are a lot of information .
This major involves all , always we have to consider the all possibilities to resolve homework , you have to know the most possible information for can resolve it .
When you got the answer or solution you can see that all effort worthwhile .
Our teachers are doctors and they are in charge of teach us about work - team , so it 's common that one / two people do all work ... with this I want to say : is rewarding when our teacher ask something and you know the answer because you could study all topic .
I have experience to go to the hospital and was too interesting .
I deal with medicine students who are superior to me , for example , doctors and surgeon .
I only could oversee what they do to obtain visual experience and know how was a surgery .
How learning English
It 's proven that to learn a foreign lengueage you have to go abroad .
You can study hard for years , but if you arent't obligated to use English for things of everyday , you wo n't became good at it .
Of course , also studyng in a foreign country has disadvantages .
Even there are lots of different possibilities and scholarship , not everydoby can allows they .
Living abroad , even though for a short time , it could be very stressful and people can feel homesick .
Despite that , there are more reasons to go studyng away .
In addition , visit new countries and meet new cultures , helps to open your mind and to foster a lot .
I did several school trips in the past years and I 'm going to do it again sure .
I am 14 eayrs old .

carbohydrates are essential for a healthy diet .
It provides energy for our bodies .
Nutritionists recommend the quarter of a person 's diet should contain carbohydrates .
When your body takes an insufficient amount of carbohydrates , the protein replaces the lack of carbohydrates to supply the body with energy .
And this will cause diseases on the long run .
Nowadays , I am studying a degree in economics at the University of Barcelona .
I am applaying for the job vacant in the summer camp .
Last year I was working every friday and sunday at a ski camp in la masella .

Now our company is going to do multidimensional operation , not just focus on furniture but also for home appliance .
In addition , we will adjust company 's management direction in each department depend on market 's reaction and environment
Like retailer ,
We have sold our products to KA system for few years , however , the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods , it means cheat and have no enter obstacles for other supplier .
In addition , it is hard to collect money from KA system .
And because we have our own factories and professional machines , we can easily to avoid the price competition .
To make high obstacle furniture , like R - angle wooden cabinet , high gloss cube .
We will search the market demand based on our core products , also produce high quality products .
For the factories , because Chinese demographic dividend are not like before anymore , the low price and undiversified products should become verity and premium goods .
Focus on user experience , inventive , unique and our core products
Therefore , we are reforming and doing high - tech items , likes LED , photoelectric , vacuum , steam mop , etc .
Use this core technology to develop blow machine , air cleaner , iron , etc .
Besides , factories are keeping going on our professional items and service like , high glossy , auto painting and 4-side edge sealing , honeycomb board , etc .

Nowadays , people have a lot of afraid about contaminations of Planet .
All governments increasing their politic laws about this topic and also they promoted new rules in the daily life of the population .
One of the new rules about the reduction of contamination in the cities is the transport public .
According to the general world laws about the global world warm , each country has considered its owns arguments about it .
I can give us an example how big cities around the world can reduce more contamination .
London is a good example and Barcelona too .
These cities do n't allow to drive in the centre city , the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .
The town major has offered to population free bus .
It 's a good idea to remove the traffic jam .
I think , in conclusion , all people should have a good behaviour and an open mind and they and myself also to catch more often the public transport .
We have different cultures here , and two main languages , Arabic and Amazigh .
Morocco is a kingdoom , like Spain and England , We have king and princes .
On Monday me and my friend Chrissy went to the Big Ben .

We travelled to London by plane , but to come back we travelled by car abd boat .
After we came back I told my family everything .
Environmental changes really need in the current situation .
People contribuation is very important in this matter .
The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway .
Firstly , hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week .
This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes .
Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation .
Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water .
Secondly , Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling .
People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away .
As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades .
In addtion to that recyclable waste , sell and the money will be given to respective person .
This gives motivation to the public and they can earn by using right way to dispose their waste .
Thirdly , Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places .
Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening , it subsidise money for their green improvements .
Example , free fertilizers , water pump failitiesand pesticides .
Is summary , people taken many intiative steps and moving forward to have safe and attracticve eniroment surrondings .

The graph given shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream from two places at an Englishl seaside resort from 2012 to 2014 , they are separately an ice - cream van and an indoor public swinmming pool .
As the graph indicates , the sales at ice - cream van was generally larger than that at indoor swimming poor .
For the ice - cream van , it saled most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly reached 5000 dollars and it was still slightly increasing year by year .
In every year , from January to July , the sales slightly increased and reached the peak at the third season , then it gradually slide back to the year 's bottom .
For indoor swimming poor , its sales did n't have large changes , usually saled about 2000 - 3000 dollars for each season .
It usually saled most in Apr - Jun and Oct - Dec and slided to the bottom in Jul - Sep .
In general , its sales were falling with the time went by .
There was a nice spring morning .
She put her cup of coffee on the windowsill , hooked up the brist on her beautiful little breast , put right her colourful light - minded skirt , took her orange scarf and red little handbag and went to the door .
When she looked at him from under her long eyelashes he turned away and stared at the landscape outside .
When she made step out , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Nowadays we constantly use means of transport to go everywhere so that our lifestyle .
We are used to travel by car , in fact each family has one .
Despite , travelling by public transport can be a better option in so many cases .
Certainly cities will be crowded in the future because population is always increasing .
Using your own car to go to the citycentre could be a nightmare , it would be a stressful waste of time .
Ubearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing too , and it likely will be as expensive that most people not be able to afford a car .
In contrast , there will be cheaper alternatives as bus , train or even plane for long distances .
In other hand , many drivers enjoy travelling by his vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free .
Finally goberments and society are concerned about the environment and I consider that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emitions .
From my point of view public transport will not disappear even if cars are much more comfortable , faster and more evolved than now .
Every one ca n't deny that time is a big factor in our life .
The life divided to terms of time , we live through time , we grow with time
till Now , we talk in time and finally , we perish after time .
World change by time .
Time never stops and does n't wait anyone .
We must value time . I hope my country to be as a developed countries in using the best use of time .
once moment lost is lost for ever .
it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time .
So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it , will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life .
The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either help you or agonist you and in the popular say is right that say " do n't delay the work of this day to the next day " because our works will accumulate then it become more hard to finish it .To ensure best use of time in our life , we need to be punctual.punctuality avoid tension and trouble things , finally even scientists have another vision about time , they discover that time is the fourst dimension by relative theory which exchange all concepts in science .
I ca n't say expect that time more important in our life and we need to save it .

The diagrams below show how bank notes are made through four steps and how bad shees and notes are disposed .
To begin with , the format of the bank notes needs to be designed , factors of considerations including the background colour , the artwork and the security issues .
Sencondly , equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps .
Thirdly , print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink , where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes .
Most importantly , manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets .
Once damaged sheets are discovered , partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes , making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality .
Good sheets are cut into separate bank notes , then packed and dispatched to other place , comparing with which , the bad ones have to be destroyed securely .
the movie which I have chosen to write about is microphone .
it is An egyption movie acted by khaled aboelnaga and young actors . the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they did n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of bands is famous between the youth and they call it " under ground bands " .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they did n't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which they never learn or love
I live in a small city , then there are few things that my town made for the environment : like the recycling , therefore we must know of what is made the material that we throw , and put them in the right dumpster .
This is a little act for us , but if we all contribute will be a big help for the environment .
We also can use appliance that not consume so much , if we can adopt sustainable electric systems or buy organic products .
In the big cities they have began to build green buildings , they use the electricial public transport not to pollute .
In my opinion there may be many rules , but if we do n't respect it , we will not help our habitat .
The most exciting day on my life was May 9th , last year , when I attend the secondary school .
I stayed on France with my friends and my teachers .
I catch the bus and I waved my mum .
After six hours we had lunch on a fast food to France .
Next we visited a famous aquarium where I looked a lot of fish .
On the evening we had dinner on a particular restaurant and my friends and I did many photo with a famous sight .
I was admiring the sea while my friends looked around the shop .
The days after we were in a parfurms and I bought a present for my mum .
My teacher wanted to our speak to French .
In the end my friends and I jumped into the sea .
At a nice day , my old brother surprise me .
It is a first time for me to play with a cat .
It is a nice experience .
I called it LOZAH because its color like an almond .
The almond is called in Arabic LOZ .
It likes my laptop and it play with the Cursor .
That is funny but makes me nervous .
It sleeps eighteen hours per a day .
The nice sleeping of it is when it watching anime .
when the children went out it became sad .
It runs behind the ants and flies .
It hates the water .
When we need to punish it we spreed some drops of water at its face .
I hope it to be a good cat and a good experience for me .
my firs job was baby sitter .
I have to look forward at two little boys : seven and nine years old .
I was seventeen years old , when I decided to accept this work .
I have been the baby sitter of these children for all that summer and I enjoyed so much with them .
They lived in a big house with a lovely swimming pool where we can swim and play .
At the end of the summer , I have kept on seeing these boys to help them during the school year .
This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister ( I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money .
I did n't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful , and also because I known them since they were newborn .
I hope to have satisfied to all your questions .
Have a good work
I grew up in a parent family .
However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried all her best to keep my older brother , my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle , young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard , so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard .
Especially I was the youngest member in the family , made much more troubles when I was young .
I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies .
That really the biggest harm to a hard - working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies .
All the members of my family never give me up , and I finished my college studies , too .I have a good job now .
I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we get not so easy .

Anyone has their favorite sports .
Someone likes go hiking , others likes dancing , still others like playing
And , either do I. I also like sports .
One of them which I like most is badminton .
Why my favorite sports is badminton ?
There are some reasons .
Second , playing badminton can active all body , like hands , arms , feet .
play it with someone , whatever just for fun or for the game , my body will feel so hot in thirty minutes .
Then , it can play indoor , also , it can play under the sun .
Playing badminton can do lots of great things for you , expect good for health , it also can make a lot
of fun and play with family or friend happily .
If someone answer me what the best sport is , I will say :
Badminton is .
My favourite sport is badminton because I used to practise it when I was a child and I loved it .
It seems to me a complete sport because you can practise it in pairs or in an individual way .
You have to be able to play for a long time , analyze your opponent 's mistakes to win and to have measure about your energy for no to be exhausted before the match is over .
For someone who is starting this sport I would give just one advise : enjoy .
Because if you are trying to win you will lose the most important thing , to discover how wonderful to play a sport could be .

Sport is important part of my life .
Two years ago when I was still in school .
But I could n't go with them at the time , I was sick a lot .
One day my friend invited me to karate .
It was strange because I never went to the sports .
After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition .
I was very worrying and nervous .
The day of the competition and I came with others to show how I 'd practiced .
Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping .
It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too .
I was very happy because it was my first competition .
Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn .
This time I felt like a Champion it was really especially feeling .
When I went to karate I 'm not even sick .
Sport has given me a boost of vitality , energy , optimism and strengthen the immune system .
My most exciting day was the June 8th 2014 , an international competition in Belgium .
The day before there were the qualifications , that I passed .
The day of the finals I was so nervous , but determined .
There were athletes who are European champions and I picked up all my courage and I did my exercises very well , except for a fall from the beam .
After the competition I was relaxed and happy , because I have done my job .
Eventually I placed 7th both beam and floor , and after we took the photos I go back to the changing room .
When I left , some girls were out of the dressing room with a sheet and a pen in the hands and they asked me an autograph .
I was really surprised and happy , I would never have thought !
The little girls thanked me , then I go to eat with my team and the day after we went back to Italy .
An easy recipe are cookies .
Mix butter , eggs and vanilla .
The mixture must be smooth and compact . Pour the chocolate and cut the cookies with a round shape .
Baker them for 15 minutes

The world is changing around .
Technologies are moving on in high speed .
As the technologies world is moving fast and the auto mobile industry is also coming with new variant of cars & scooters in very economical way .
Buying cars and scooters are more convenient than the last decade .
In few decade people earnings and living style have also changed .
People now buying cars and scooters as per their convenience and pocket .
Earlier people used to buses , taxes , autos for reaching offices , schools , colleges , shopping etc .
Which was time consuming and obliviously cheaper way of commuting from one place to other .
Since today worlds is time saving world hence people do n't care about their pocket .
Using personal veihicles is more convenient to them than using public transport .
So the public transports importance is reducing every day .
If it so their will a time when single people will not interested for public transport .
This has tremendous impact on other aspect .
Fuel consumption has increased in few years .
Net of cars and bikes is reason for heavy traffic jam every side .
Ratio of road accidents has been increased in few decades .
People not even care about safety parameters while driving on road .
I must say that Public transport is life line in today worlds .
Public transport is a very useful resource , you can travel without polluting the atmosphere and it is very cheap .
But , why it will disappear ?
Nowadays , we usually travel very often to many different places , so for us is more comfortable our cars , but for the atmosphere and for our wallets , it is n't .
Using public transport we will avoid traffic and so many accidents , so why we do n't use it more ?
It will be a great advance for people and for the atmosphere , and as well for the countries because we will save a lot of money
I think that family 's members could n't be friends because the relation is very different .
Firstly , family is the base of the relationships .
Secondly , although the friendship and love are the most important feelings , the family structures the person and influences their behavior .
I feel my family in a different way from my friends .
Although I have a good relationship with my parents , I could n't think them like friends .
Some people think that this is possible but I disagree because it confuses roles in the family .
The parents have to give education to the children over obviously love
In conclusion I think that two relationship are different .
Perhaps I think that this statement is false because I think that statement should say that the the public transport is going to have in the future because travelling by car is not so much more convenient .
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own sit and in the winter your car is hot and you also can listen to the radio .
In the public transport you do n't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you do n't have air conditioning so if it 's cold in the outside it 's cold inside the transport to , sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness .
Otherwise the public transport do n't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by public transport than travelling by car
The walls are green and blue , on the green wall there are some of my photos , and on the wall there are some photos of my brother .
There is a bedside table in the middle of two beds , on this there are the alarm clock and the book that we read
There are two wardrobe , one for me and one for my brother .
There is a stereo system on the bench and scareted around the room there are a lot of puppets
Near my bedroom , there is a little room , in this room there are my red desk , a white bookshelf and one globe .
Hello , my name is habiba jahid I am fifteen years old I live in Egypt .
I like English very much I like learning new languages and things .
I am not a native speaker of English but I wish that I will be one day .
what makes me like learning new languages is how it makes me communicate with others easily , I also like traveling so much as it makes me see new places and learn more about other countries around the world and their cultures and traditions however , I do n't travel outside my country because I am a student and I do n't have my own money which I can spend it on what I like .
my dreams when I grow up that I travel alot around the world , marry a romantic funny person , have a good life and be a good mother like my mother .
Years ago I was very worried how will happening in the future .
About the contamination , technology , obesity and other things around the world .
But , in this moment the people think different , is to start to help the world and
Contamination is big problem for us and the planet .
In the past the people bought thing , and they did n't care how is dangerous for the planet .
Now , the people is more conscious and they know how dangerous is for the planet .
Also , TV , radio , internet , big companies has adverisement for helping the planet .
Moreover , schools since kindergarten is educating for clean the planet , simply like separate the garbage .
Obesity and other thins about help , is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem .
For example , the form to prepare the food , is gon na be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us .
To turn to , alredy people cook the food in form organic o with products more naturally without chemical .
But this kind of food is expensive and the people can not buy .
Technology has good thing and bad things .
The technology is advancing very fast , in the best way this is good for us because we wiill do a lot of thing .
Maybe , in 2060 we will be able to go to the moon very easy , like go to Europe .
Also , the cars will fly , and maybe is better for the city .
In conclusion I think that we on track for the next years .
Compared with the past the people is more conscious and is worries for the world .
As a result for that we going to have a better life , more healty and clean for the next years .
I hope to continue in this way because is our future , is our life and we have to care it for have good and happy life in the next years .
No one can deny the importance of the public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector transport .
And this importance of private transport because private transportation provide a comfortable mean to move from one place to another , also it is help to keep a time and reduce costs which spending in public transportation .
firstly , that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip .
Secondly , it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay , and nowadays we can not waste our time in taking public transport .
finally , a public transport need more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing , and this problem we do not face it by private transport ,

The tv shows broadcasted on television play a vital role in shaping the thoughts of the viewers .
I think , I can agree with the opinion , that shopping is not always enjoyable .
In my opinion it is dependent on that , what we buy and with who we go to the shopping .
To tell the true , shopping is so bored to men , particularly when they go to the store with women .
Then they are always crying and yelling like wild goats .
When I 'm listening this , I want to commit hara - kiri .
why do use public transport some of us use it to save money for not buying gas or they ca n't buy a car or if they had problems in their cars or they do n't have the mood to drive .
Now a days with technology we have different ways to transport like hoverboards , skateboards and maybe it makes No future for public transport
Another point is we have our own cars and it 's more comfortable , I do n't have to wait in line to buy tickets .
I do n't have to be late for the delays , I can do anything in my own car I can put music I can drink , eat , speak or wherever .

First of all it is absolutely minimum , you just need boots for run !
It is one main condition , rest of your dress are not important .
Shoes are for protect and prevent your health , you have got only one body look after them .

I can give the advice to the people who are interested in the playing cricket they must know the all rules in the cricket before playing it .
There are three bunk bed next to wardrobes .
Finally , there are some posters and some shelf with my games .
This sport is an invidual sport , then you win alone and do n't win a team , but if you play tournaments in double the one who wins is the team .
This sport is very famous all over the world , but in Italy is n't very famous , becouse in Italy the soccer is more famous than the tennis .
But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis , i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years will be very famous all over the world , then you do n't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player !
If you start playing tennis you go to a famous tennis club , or you choose the best tennis mister , who will introduce the tennis and you will the shots , including the forehand , the backhand , the smash and the service .
So you will become one of the most famous player all over the world and you will win a lot of tennis tournament , including the four slam : the Australian Open , the Us open , the Roland Garros and the Wimbledon .

It is great when you are in a cup and goes very far in the tournament .
It is also really fun to be with everyone who 's is whit in the team .
When you playing a cup you playing really much football and you are also very much with your friends .
When you go far in a cup you got to play a lot of games .
If you are going to begin playing football you need footballs shoes you also need protections for the legs .
If you starting this sport you need to think it 's funny to play it .
If you do n't think it is a funny sport you would not go it .
You should not play the sport just because you 're friends doing that , do it because you like to play .

Hi Alex I could n't wait until I see you
I really think taht we should go that new centre that you wrote about in your last email and do some of the activities .
I would prefer to do the sailing on the river , because as you know I never learn how to ride a bike .
But we could also try the climbing but it would be better if we could cimbing outside , in the countryside .
Perhaps on Saturday night we could watch a horror movie , as we both love , or comedy .
However if we not too tired at the time we could go out .
I will really like if my parents could take me to your house on Friday evening but I think that we have a party that night .
But I will try to convince they .
Citizens want at the same time efficient and quick means of transportation , personalised solutions to meet their transportation needs , and the cheapest transportation cost .

I think that public transport is much better for the enviromment than the private .
If the people travelled more often in public transport we would n't pollute so much .
I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens .
So I do not agree with this afirmation , in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport .
After that kiss , Elizabeth was very surprised , but Jason was a little bit rigid .
Maybe he is sorry she thought , but why if she is perfect , she is everything that a man could want , so what happen .
-Oh , amm- He gets a little bit of blush in his face- I … amm , I am sorry ! - He screams and his face gets totally red .
He seems different , she never imagined that Jason can be like that , she fantasy with someone , brave and strong , and she never foresees something like this , but she feel something for him , maybe she is in love with this guy .
-I'm sorry - he repeats again but more serious and with his normal face - Is cause , well is my first kiss ok ! , I can fight with Bloutums , Dragons , Two - Headed snake and everything that you can imagine .
But this thinks of l … lo … love , can put me very nervous- the blush comes again .
- jajaja- she smiles - it 's ok , do n't worry , it is my first kiss too , and I like it- she smiles again , but this time , the smile seems false .
Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl , but Jason is not convince , because when he kiss her , he does n't feel nothing , he does n't feel that gravity disappear , and when his face turn red , he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him .
Almost at the same time they kissed
-Hey , do n't run Snow

When they enter in the dressmaker market , Lucresia was n't there .
But there were a lot of beautiful dresses , in high - tech closets with lights .
-This dresses are made of textile fiber almost everything here is synthetic and portable for everyone - explain Snow .
- Wow , everything is beautiful , its make me feel like I am suspended in a dream of fairytale .

I run everyday .
When I was running , I feel relax on it .
Moreover , when I was running , I can through a lot of thing about myself or how to solve some of the problem from daily .
Therefor , running can let me feel happy .
In the past , cars are only affordable for the upper level while for the middle class and lower there are not many choice for them beside walk and public transportation .
Since technology and standard of living are improved , many people left the traditional habit in using public transportation and choosing car for several reasons .
The first one is to preserve time .
As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first , moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Secondly , public transportation usually very crowded and make us not feel safe since there is an opportunity for us to be theft .
Then by car we can enjoy the scenery , share laugh , change our destination by sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted if people think a car is more comfortable to be used rather than public transportation .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family can have more than one that make the number of car growing rapidly but they do not think further about the negative side effects that a car has .
Firstly , it leading us to global warming since the concentration of pollution are higher in many countries , moreover actually it is not only leading but also make global warming faster and also can threat our health .
Then roads are more crowded right now and there are so many traffics so people wasted longer time in the road , then it makes one of the positive points of using a car is gone and the importance of public transportation is needed .
While in the statement is written that public transportation will be left by many people , in my opinion is the opposite that public transportation is our future .
It can be proved by now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher , beside it is not as costly as using a car , the quality of public transportation are improved so citizen have no worry using it .
There is n't any animal on the farm .
That is hardly surprising , it is close since 2005 .
You 'll have to take the cow by the horns and get some work done !
In the future , people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage , people on the ground ca n't survive .
Even of the grass ca n't alive on earth .
Thought , but most people do not be the member of the team of alive .
Cause of lots of damage , but they did n't Take responsibility .
And I do n't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years .
Firstly , I agree about learning different concepts because you can analyse different opinions .
But you need , understand the main idea .
In other words , some professor when teaches different topics they explain the concepts and it 's difficult to learn .
Sometimes it 's so difficult say the same words for the students . I recommend read different ideas .
Anyway , if you read different books you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's very important to learn the concept than saying something stupid ....
So , if you need techniques for learning you need to analyse and create your own words , this way you will never forget this definition .

Dear Carlos Sotelo ,
In the gym they are many people .
The days that we have to do sports if the weather is good we do it outside but if the weather is bad we have to do in the gym .
That day we are many people and classes at the same time and sometimes we ca n't have the class comfortably .
Apart from this problem we have another problem that it is important too .
This problem is that some aparatus are brouken and the paint is bad .
For me the solutions to that 's problems are esey .
In the first problem you have to organis the time table in order to have 1 class in each time4 .
And the solution for the second problem is that you have to do maintenaits ouans a year .
I hope your positive awnser to me .
yours sincerely , Maximiliano Khachaturyan .

My Life in University
The life in university have a lot of difficult and interesting things .
Of course , everything always have two - faced .
When I live in university , my life has become change a lot of .
Firstly , studying is very difficult because you have to accept new ways of studying- studying by myself .
In addition , my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English , which I ca n't catch up on lessons well in the first time .
I was very inconfident about myself and i ca n't make friends well so I think that it 's too difficult to ask teachers or friends .
I always try to find out reasons which take a lot of time .
Moreover , I need to improve my skills such as reading , listening , writing , and speaking , they help me to catch up on my teacher ' s lesson .
Secondly , studying in university , I have to live far from house which make me be homesick , sad , and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends , they 're very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates .
Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes , I must take a lot of time to finish everything before I star learning .
The first time living here , i used to called my family and complained about here 's life .
However , life 's university have many conveniences .
Before I want to pay money for something , I always think carefully that I 'm really necessary or not .
Sometimes , I broke up nearly and I was really worried so I have to pay money suitably .
When I living alone , I have to save money because there are many situations which I have to slove without family , and you can become a good person with many good characters such as confident , independent , friendly .
Because my family always prepared everything for me when I lived with them so it 's very difficult to be independent .
But today , I have to do it , I have to solve my problem , manage money , wash clothes by myself .
In addition , I can be confident because teachers require everybody in class have to stand in front of class and speak English .
Living alone you have to make friends when you 're sad .
Studying new lessons from society .
Jogging the sport in the nature
During I go jogging I can think about all the daily thing in my life .
When I am in a bad mood I go jogging outside and hear how the birds singing .
For me jogging is very stressless .
At one day I go alone for me , so I can calm down or think through .
At an other day I go jogging with my best friend , so we talk a lot and have fun while we do sport .
Jogging is a sport you can start it every day .
You do n't need a lot of aquitment , so you do n't have to buy a lot .
I think for people who are fat , they can go jogging but a little bit slowler .
You have to notice that and go tomorrow jogging .

This report shows the sorts of shop which are localizated in Moral de Calatrava .
It is though that Chinnesse shops are the cheapest by far .
But maybe , the most important thing is the variety of products which can be found there : from cleaning products until a little furniture .
2 . Fashion in little towns .
Traditional clothes : that kind of clothes can be expensive but if you want to live like in the past , you can put on that and you will have really fun although that clothes went out of style a lot of years ago .
Something more fashionable : there are also a few clothes shop were you can find a lot of sorts of fashionable Italian and Spanish designes .
If you need something for a special event like a wedding , you can go to three shops which are specialited in that .
3 . Farmer markets .
Every Saturday morning , this village organizes a market where people can buy some natural vegetables or fruit which had been grown up by local farmers .
That is the reason why its price is so low .
-Even though you can find a lot of bargains , do n't spent too much if you do n't need it .
If you look like a foreign people , local people can try to rip you off .
-If you buy some clothes , assure yourself that they fit you and you like them enough to conservate .

There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia .
It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier .
Because of different culture backgrounds , the talking style of internaional students who come from different countries are various .
For example , people always walk on the right of the road in China .However , Australian 's rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road .
Secondly , loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends .
Thirdly , students ca n't be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers , pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security .
The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information about Australia culture in order to suit quickly .

A game of gentlemen is my favourite game , yes I mean Cricket .
In my country we follow cricket as a religion .
Cricket is played by 11 players , which includes a captain , a wicket keeper and rest batsman and bowler .
Player who can bat and bowl is called all - rounder .
This game is played in three format i.e. Test Cricket ( 5 day game ) , One day Cricket and Twenty - Twenty .
Test cricket is old format and I love this format as it really tests the players skills and only best player can get success in this format .
But as this takes 5 days many people do n't have time to watch this game and its loosing its popularity in young generation .
My favourite sport is football .I think , this game is the most enjoyable .
Its popularity spreads all over world too .
There are many reasons behind it to be popular .
Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session .
The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below :
1.A football player should be punctual and hard - working .
2.He should be disciplined .
3.During his playing time , he sought to give his full concentration .

I think that for people who want learning English Write and Improve it is great !
I like it very much , it is very useful for me .
I tried it last weekend and I will use it all days ! if I used that every day I would improve in a short time !
There is no doubt that the man 's lives are evolved .
All thanks to new creations technologies , the innovation in the field of medicines and the new scientific discoveres .
To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone , satnav , digital TV , Internet ..
Let 's suppose a teenager of twenty - first century during the Middle ages .. do n't get out alive without Wi - fii !
First of all in the next 50 years the people 's life do n't resamble at all this .
As far as I 'm concerned we would be submerged by too many tools which will replace manpower and craft , in addition the globalization will lose cultural traditions of each country .
On the one hand I 'm for development on the other hand I would that the innovations will not destroy the old .
Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to do n't forget the past .
Apart from that I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that took me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robot instead of the weiters in a restaurant .
To conclude I ca n't think which wonderful thing the man will do in spite I hope make the word even better !
Hi there ,
I have read the advertisement and I promise you that I am the perfect for this post .
and I know how to take care of a camp . I 'm funny and cheerful but I 'm also professional so I know how to take care of the children .
I am an experienced cooker so I can also cook for the children , I am also a good singer so we can sing songs together with the children .
Your friend ,
I can not agree with the statment of " no future for public transport " provided that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , the public transport is more rather convenient than irvate car .
The subway reaches most part of the London , and people can travel many places .
The accessibility is not just improving underground , but also on the ground and bridging .
The environment is becoming a more and more burning issue , especially from many years to nowadays .
That 's because pollution has now reached critical levels and that 's why we must take it under control and solve it .
We already know that a great part of the pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of the transports that invade cities worldwide .
However , we can already fight this - waiting the developing of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable , sustainable energy . - for example taking advantage of public transports .
Apart from that , even greater is the pollution of seas and rivers .
This is caused by the waste of factories , but also by the damages that tankers do not only to the sea , but to the mainland too .
In addition , what about domestic wastes , which are our reality ? We should all learn to manage our wastes , because each of us , in our own small , is a great damage for the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is never too late for saving our wonderful world .
Well , in my hometown there is about a little more than half a million people .
But if you leave the city about 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalls .
When you have skill to read a book and in that moment you are searching for good job you can find a lot jobs because you can develop easy when you compare with another person that they have been searched job to
My favourite restaurant is situated in Modugno .
It 's placed in a quiet street , so the restaurant is often very relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The furniture consists in a set of chairs , tables and some sofas , covered with red clothes .
The restaurant appears very elegant and traditional .
The owner prefers to leave on only the TV , but often the dining room is silent .
I find it appreciable : I really love to talk to the people I 'm eating with .
Despite this , the resaturant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hanged up to the walls .
I really like it , because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I 'm looking to .
Everything is delicious and very tasting , especially pizzas : they dress them in many different ways : I try a different meal every time I go there .
At last , it is not expensive at all .
she finally felt that she is wanted that she could do anything she wants , and that no one is more clever than another , they 're all the same .
The thoughts which people put in her mind was absolutely wrong she ca n't deny that those thoughts affected her badly , reached her to the point that made her hate herself .
The words they said to her was a killing ones , they colored her life in black , till it 's the only time to prove to them that she can do anything , she 's good at everything like them all , that she just did n't want to do like them all as she just hated the way .
that 's it , not for being non clever .
being unsuccessful in studying is a horrible thing , it affects man badly .
That was me , I never liked studying , I never found myself in those subjects , but it was n't the big deal to me , I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser , as I was n't that , I knew that I 'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they 're all did n't get that , they judged me for my marks but marks do n't form brains or thoughts , marks is n't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future .
whatever , In high school the senior year here in our country identify your future ; the college you 'll spend your life studying in and working by its knowledge , so I get that i should do all my best this year so my future could be better . and it happened I showed them all that I can do whatever I want even if the things I was n't like as they see me , and that all my previous marks was n't my best . I got high score and entered The faculty of Engineering which was the top college .
People thoughts have the power to make you feel the best feeling ever and literally the opposite , just do n't think about anyone 's thoughts but you , as you have the control of your life not anyone else .
your thoughts are the only ones that will make the differences , so take care of them only and believe in yourself so you could reach the prestige you 're looking for .
Do n't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up and continue in the successful life , Fight .

I 'm living in Taiwan , Taichung .
How is the area to take care of the environment ?
It build a lot of facilities for residents .
For example : Lots of Bicycles .
This provide people who want to go to a place that distance is not too long .
And it face another question : morality .
People probably destroy those bikes , and cause bikes become less and less .
But , fortunately , people living in this area all use these bikes carefully , so we do n't care so much that thing .
Second facility is public bus .
Large of bus all around the city .
When students finish their class , they take but to home .
Worker are off duty , taking bus to home , too .
Family can take the bus to place to place , instead of driving .
It makes farther or mother more convenient !
Third , lots of green area .
Taichung have plenty of tree at the park .
So when children are playing around these tree , they can feel more healthy with pure air .
And that 's talk about the bigger area , Taiwan .
Train , bus , Mass Rapid Transit , and air plant .
People living in Taiwan , no matter whether you are local people or not , you can use all of these facilities .
And lots of city government advocate protecting animals .

A lot of people use public transport every day in this world , but some people prefer use your own car to go to the work , school , and whatever .
Some people have your own car , but prefer use public transport .
Today in the streets have a lot of cars , bus , motorcycle , other kind of transportation .
All the people should use your own car to go somewhere just when it 's necessary , because each car on the street is bad to our environment .
All the people should use public transport to reduce the number of the cars on the street

In my city there is an old town who was declared in 1986 World Beautiful City .
One of the most kown building is the Churruca Earl Palace , who has a medieval tower with the battlements ( the rest of the towers in the city does not have ir because the Muslims took them out ) .
As well is important because during de Civil War , the General Franco was living there for a week .

Nowadays the Palace has a very good restaurant with a comfortable patio where you can taste the most exclusive products from Extremadura .
The present chapter aims to introduce audiovisual translation ( AVT ) - one of the most popular type of translation nowadays .
Audiovisual translation brings a lot of dilemmas and constraints with which translators must agonise .
But it exists a variety of techniques which helps to tackle with this kind of problems .
The chapter will also cover the definition of the notion of pun a stylistic figure and how puns transfer from one language into another .
In extension of this , I will evaluate whether the effect of the pun in the original version is maintained in the dubbing version .
The garbage cans are about each home .
Garbage truck pick up them twice on the week .
There are many a small garbage cans about cafe , stores , and other public place .
Every morning special track to clean the roads and walk way .
The advance of technology in the last years has been awesome .
The first computers was created in 1946 for John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert in the United States .
Its keyboard had a lot of buttons and its screen did n't have any colours .
Computers did n't have any programmes and resulted limited , boring and tedious .
In the present , computers are multifuncional .
WiFi , port USB , among other things .
They are faster and smaller than before and you need a mouse to use it .
Its screen has colours and HD
In my last week went to Florida with my family .
Then there went to the cinema and saw the Harry Potter film .
My brother went to the NBA league and see the match the Arenas vs Orlando And now I go to my house and then I 'm going to invite friends .
In my opinion , the public transport has future because this is cheaper than other transport , also its pollution is lower .
The car is a transport more comfortable than the public transport but is not sustainable , its cost is higuer and if all people move by car , The cities will be very pollutes .
Also , in the big cities , the public transport is more punctual than the car because this transport usually has its own lane , while if you use the car , you takes more because there are a lot traffic in your lane .
Other transport that can be very used in the future is the bike , this transport is cheap and ecological , also , more and more the cities are building a lot bike lane so is a good alternative .
For travelling other cities or town , in my opinion , the car will remain the transport most used , although the new transports could change this situation .
For the finish , I think that the transport most use in the cities in the future will be the bus , metro and bike and for travelling enter cities the car will remain the most used .
Dear James !
Thank you for inviting me there !
It was really enjoyable and funny .
I was especially delighted with national music and Latin American dances .
Your dear , Vitaly
Now a day , more and more people have their own car .
When they go out for work or other purposes , they choose to drive by themselves .
People do n't need to wait for public transport if they were driving their own cars .
It is not only convenient but also time saving .
With these benefits , it seems that there will be less and less people willing to take the public transport .

I play this sport since I was child , and today I still love it .
The dream of every person that play this sport , as well as a hobby , is to make it a profession , but very few people did it .
Nowadays I play football twice a week , Monday and Friday , because for me it is remained one hobby .
I like to play football cause for me , as well as one hobby , is one way to stand out of the world , of the problem that every day I have to face , and at the end it makes me calm and happy .
I recommend this sport to all people , because it could be , as me , one moment to distract from the world , one moment to spend without thinking about tmorrow .
The football could be one way to meet your friends , and to spend time with them .
Trust me , I 'll be right .
My undergraduate studies in Pharmacy at the University of Asia Pacific gave me a solid background in health care sector and chemistry , as well as strong theoretical framework , while allowing me to explore my personal interests in pharmaceutical technology .

Many people think that for badly behaviour of young people are responsible their parents and they should be punished for that .
First of all , when children are small , they are polite and always listen parents , for example they are doing homework , going to sleep in regular hours and back home after school .
This is a time , when parents could create behaviour of their children , because when they grow up , they are beginning rebel and do things which are good in their opinion .
Secondly , for behaviour of older children like teenagers have an impact other factors , it are not only their parents but other people , whose surrond them .
It is a time when children must choose , which people are good or bad , which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements .
When they choose bad , they could began stopped do things which were important for them in previous period in their life .
In summary , I would like to point out that the most impact for young people have their own , because life is a time when people only choosing .
Parents are very important , because they can suggest some solutions , but final decision must undertake their children .

The next day , on Tuesday was hard for me to get up , but the simple fact of seeing my classmates it was so much easier .
I arrived at the school with all the energy , and I decided that this semester will be better than the other .
Thus the classes have just begun with new teachers and others who have already taught me .
What heavy was that teachers have already given us all homework for the week .
Later , I went to my house with my mom and I helped her make the meal and did the clean up .
After that , I did my homework because I had a lot of and it was pretty hard .
So every day I kept awake .
My dad told me do your best and if this semester going well for me , my dad will give me a tablet because I really need it .
However on Saturday I went to English classes in the evenings .

I had been worked at local cinema last summer .

Once upon a time , a young boy called Michael , was walking opposite of a beautiful lake .
When , he saw into the water , he found a little ill frog .
After that , Michael decided to bring it up because the frog was very ill .
The frog got well while I was at home for two months .
Michael closed the door and kew at that moment he had made a mistake because he lost his house .
It was a sunny and hot day , Peter decided to go to the waterfront promenade and have a walk .
Suddenly , he heard a high - pitched scream .
Then he saw a woman started to jump over the enclosure !
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to avoid her from committing suicide .
He shouted out loud for help but no one was around him .
So he contacted the police for help immediately .
In a flash of an eye , the police came .
At last , the life of the woman was saved by the police and the police thanked Peter for confirming them .
The one I most admire is called Ronaldinho , a football player that in my opinion is the best of all time .
He won only one gold ball , but he should have won more than that .
He mostly played with number 10 even thouhg he also played with numbers 80 , 45 .
He was born in Porto Alegre , in 1980 , and played in several teams like Barcelona or AC Milan .
The skills he make are wonderful , he know everything about football , his passes were fantastic , he passed the ball even with the back !
Even though most of people think that Messi or Ronaldo Nazario are even better than him , other people think same as me .
The kitchen looks like small and simple .
The living room shares area with dining room .
it all started when I found a book on the bus .
This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it this time everything did not matter to me I want to finish the book as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in .
In the end a lady interrupted me and I was angry about the situation .
that was the reason I do not finish the book
Nowadays our world is fighting everyday against diferrent problems , one day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmosphere conditions or many others .
Today we can try to imagine how our lives can change in the next 50 years , if it will be better or worse .
In my opinion everyone 's life will have a great improvement , from the economic point of view but also from the social and cultural one .
It is known that in the future will come the day in which any kind of unrenewable resource will finish .
But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources , as the eletricity given by the light of the sun rays .
Or in addition , we can use the energy given by the environment , as the wind or the inorgainc rest .
Maybe there will be also great new discoveries from the medicine that will make disappear any kind of diseases .
To sum up , I think that we have to expect a great future in which men will regain possession of his whole capability and thanks to it he will change everyone 's lives in best .
Today I was at the university to learn new things .
Cristina really likes dogs also she is too pretty .
Fernando is a young man , he likes to hear English music .
Jose is not in my university but we are good friends .
Pedro is a good friend , he loves to read books and he is working with your mother .
Ivan is from Machachi , he is not studying anything but I am sure that he is a great person .
When I was a child I wanted to be doctor .
Two year ago , I won a nice cap .
I have 6 people in my house .
I grow up in Machachi .
Last mouth I went to Machalilla National Park with my friends .
Los Frailes is in Machalilla National Park , It is a wonderful beach , the sand is too white .
I 'm interested in sport;football .
Because it 's the most common sport all over the world as well as I 'm good at football , so I play football with my friends every weekend always play on Tuesday evening .
Also , it 's good for fit and health .
I 'd like giving you some advice about how to start playing sport .
I think it 's good idea if you buy some kits for football and training with your friend before match at home or playground for two or three days .
Next , you can play with anyone on confident and control match .
moreover , sometimes why do n't you run in the morning ?
In my opinion , it 's useful to play football .
I understand what you mean because cars are so convenient as you said .
You do n't need to care about time tables .
Also , during your journey , you might be able to stay night in your own car .
But nowadays , cars are one of the reasons to cause the earth warming and air pollution .
Car companies try to spread electric cars but it seemed to take a long time .
And some people have already switched to use public transport like trains or buses .
Moreover , it 's still popular to travel long journey with trains or ships because the scenery you can see from them are totally different from the one from cars .
According to these reasons , I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
" Annabelle " is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday .
I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie .
The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited by a preist who blesses her twice a month .
John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife : a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress .
Unfortunatelly , in a horribble night the couple"s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them .
The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things ... Annabelle .
After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly , Annabelel wants to kill her .
Even the preist doesn 's know how to help the unhappy familly .
Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll .
Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one ...
The aim of this report is to highlight how the citizens care of the environment , in order to give suggestions to keep this area clean .
In the matter of that , information concerning what people do , or could do , are going to be shown .
Few people who live in the suburban areas have the following routine :
2 Divide wet rubbish from the products which can not be recycled .
3 Denounce those who leaves rubbish in the wrong spaces .
If the majority of citizens , including the ones who live in the city centre , had followed these ideas , this city would have been surely cleaner .
Unfortunately , deeper problems are linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants respect those principles .
Some thought that volunteers should involve careless people in many project to keep their city attractive and marvelous .
It is proven that to be a part of a project always make people feel useful .
Nowadays we can see that each time more public transport need to improve the quality of your services , the people daily need this kind of transport go to work , go to school and in general depend so much of the public transport .
The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus , trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy .
Today many people prefer to travel by car than public transport because of the bad quality services , the bus , the trains are full and many times are until dirty and late .
However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car .
I am writing this letter because we have to improve the gym of the school .
The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain :
the first problem is that we do n't have enough aparatous for all of the students
the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school did n't the manteinace long time ago
For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students
For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school
I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you
I look forward to hearing from you soon
I work as freelancer journalist , prepare reports dealing with a whole situation in the city of Jerusalem , and publish my reports in many of the websites .
I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement " The Voice of Women " which issued by the WATC " Women 's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work " Maan " , annd other web sites and news and media organizations .
the world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind in consequence , it caused the global warning which been the most important global problem it does n't mind to more than three quarters of the world population .
Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials , all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood , accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can .
Frist of all at home we recycle plastics , glasses , papers and cartons , oils , clothes , batteries , organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere . then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it
A couple of years ago , I hardly could see any bins in supermarkets and houses .
Nowadays , I see everywhere bins and even a small kid of 3 years being teached to put unwanted materials in the bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and how much progress my small village has had done in 2 years of time .
Even though , there are not provided separate bins for different categories of dirt .
So , We can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin .
In spite of throwing dirt in a bin we also making some harm to environment unknowingly .
As there are different kinds of materials , dirt . some are renewable and some are not .
In my opinion , in the next 50 years , humanity will increase and there wo n't be resources enough for everybody .
There will be on another planets , for example the moon , many citadels inside an enormous domes .
Then , I suppose that in every country will be used much more renewable energies instead nuclear energies for reassure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe everybody will use electric car for decrease the atmospheric pollution .
The people 's live will change even by policy and the economy .
I hope that in the future there will not be any war by the economic crisis .
I think that public transport has a future , indeed travel in car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
But there 's a thing , no one have enough money to buy a car or maybe two ; that 's why there 's a lot of people who prefer the public transport .
Perhaps in a future public transport it can be more comfortable for the rest of the people who does n't have a car .
I think that there is n't for public transport because nowadays the people usually use your private car .
This is some adventeges such us it is more comfortable and fast .
when you travel by bus you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car .
Sometimes private transports is cheaper if you go is other people .
for example when you go by car you can go with other people so you pay less money for gasoil .
On the other hand , private transport are damaging for planet because we must take care of the planet . we can help to prevent the contamination of the enviroment , if we take travel public transport which do n't pollute .
At the moment , there are more one car to person , it is a problem for me because people do n't take cure envarioment .
they prefer to be comfortable .
in conclusion using public transport produce less damage to the environment and most people prefer .
I want to describe a famous actor from my country , he is Sergey Bezrukov .
He participates in many interesting movies and operas .
Some of them I saw , when was a young girl .
He has very important skills for the actor , these are charisma and charm .
What is more , he is a good husband and father for his children .
I think he deserved to be famous , because he is a very talented person .
Now he has opened his owned company .
I am plannning to visit his company .
One of his interesting film about musician , which was popular for 1980 - 2000 years .
His name is " Visockiy " .
Life is unpredictable and unforseen .
The immense possibilities of life give us opportunity to explore life but some times it lead to threat and dangers to our life .
We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones .
But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely .
It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc .
The insurance for non accidental death is known as general insurance and for life is known as life insurance .
But we still sold it not bought it .
Number of countries give attention and provide secure life to their citizens .but our country still under insurance .
Government should play key role by providing trustworthy organization surveyors loss assessors etc .
To aware people by run awareness campaign .
To provide insurance at nominal prices.and claim polocies should be easy .Give surety so that people can accept and trust the insurance companies .
Fdi can play important role in it .
It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce .
I love soccer because when I was child my brothers were taking with them to the club and I enjoy it when I watch them .
First , soccer is very famous game in the world and a lot of people like to play soccer and I try to play like them .
for example , I can watch many matches a day and I enjoy it when I watch famous players such Cristiano Ronaldo with Real Madrid and Messy with Barcelona .
Second , soccer is very interesting game because when I play soccer I feel very happy .
Moreover , soccer help human body to be very healthy because when someone play soccer his organisms become strong .
Finally , I like playing soccer because most of my friends like me play soccer too much everyday that makes me love it too much .
I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures , but in the same time it is very nice game .
I read your e - mail , so let 's talk about books ! I usually read a book on my free time , because I prefer story than short articles .
Recently I read four great books about Shoah , they were very interesting , my favourite was : " The Book Thief",I read it for school , but I have already saw the film of this book .
It 's a very mooving book , but it is n't difficult , I think that 's for teenagers , but is also good for adults .
I love the thing , that in this book , there are a lot of German words , so I also could improve my German ( I go to the languages high school ) .
Last Friday I 've visited Balla without any planning .
I usually wake up at 10 am at that day my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla with them .
He usually avoids me in this kind situation .
Nowadays he treats me as botheration .
The reason he told me to go Balla is Noman will feel alone there as Badhon and her mother is not going .
I was in a bit hesitation latter decide to go .
Actually I do n't have enough courage to say no to my father .
We have been told earlier that Abul kaka has got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from office nonetheless the performance of the vehicle was awful that day .
It shut down at the road for several times while we were on the way .
So I was feeling very anxious that if the car fail in Aricha highway .
Because I was so sure Abul kaka and Noman will prefer Aricha highway rather than the Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable in hi - ways for many reasons .
Those are the most risky roads of the country . if there is an alternate way I always use that .
That 's why when I go to village I like to use the Singair Road than DHAKA - ARICHA highway .
When I was a youngster , my father and I rode motorcycle to visit our place using this road .
As I was a kid I fall asleep sometimes .
May be for that I have a high regard for the road .
noman engaged the front seat .
Though he was unwilling to sit there as because abul kaka or my father should be seated there .
But they insist him .
When the car stopped to take oil at a service station near Gilando , my father asked me to go the very back benches of the jeep .
I thought I should n't come as because those benches were disgraceful for me .
I feel like I 'm depriving by my family .
If I were in a better position it could not happen to me .
Peoples humiliate me in many ways because I do nothing for earnings .
I found it very painful when my parents do it to me .
I keep my brain cool and try to overcome the situation by thinking one day I will prove myself . I know who I am and what I 'm doing .
My thoughts are unquestionably better than others .
Hence I 'm waiting for good time .
We reached our home at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhaka at 4:00 pm .
It gives the impression that only going and coming in a big car is the main purpose of the tour .
That the I spent most of my time with Noman with his over talking habit .
We visited nagar chak with much anticipation .
In this season I kike to see the sun shine .
The crystal clear and mild sun is very favorite of mine .
While I was listening noman I was discerning that I should question more .
When he talks he has done many mistakes because of his over talking habit .
at 4:00 pm we set for Dhaka was an early move because of faulty car .
I fall asleep as soon as we crossed jhitka bazar in addition when I wake up we had crossed Tora bridge .
We stopped our car to a road side tea stall to take tea .
Than we set for Dhaka .
When we talked to our seniors I think I should control myself though they talked unreal things .
They prefer industrialization over nature .
At the same time they also keep saying that nature was more green and vigorous in our time .
A never ending argument took places and thus we reached Dhaka .
Travelling or moving from place to another by car is much more convenient for a man than public transport .
By car you can go whenever you want on time with no need to wait for hours at the stations for bus or subway .
For example , if you are in a hurry and want to catch the place you are heading to , you can drive as fast as possible .
You can have some other choices that you can stop to buy something : water , juice or snack if you get hungry your way or thirsty .
You even can take a rest for awhile pleasingly to sleep or to have a nap .
You would n't suffer anymore from the trouble or annoying stuff on bus most of the time like : no room for you to sit , bad smell people can make , or get bothering or bushing .
It 's convenient already .
But , on the other hand , because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable ; cars are so many ; very noisy , unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth .
In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First , the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second , they should make awareness campaigns about environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally , to stay healthy we need a healthy environment .
But at the region where I live I had not found .
Sundly , started krav maga class in a gym close to my house .
I did not think two times .
I went there and sang .
It is a good self defence ... it is object , simple and fast .
Krav maga teaches how to control ourselves in hard situations .
If it was not true , the life would be so better .
The most exciting day of my life was when I and my sister discovered that we would spend one week on a cruise with our friends ! that was a very beautiful Holiday !
We spent a lot of time together every day ; we visited some fantastic cities in Greece like Santorini , Athens and many others .
In Italy we also visited Bari and Venice too .
Every day we spent time on the beach and across the sea .
Every evening we went to the restaurant on the cruise .
Meals were very good and also in the morning I ate English breakfast or eggs and bread because I wanted to change my routine while I was on the cruise .
I think it 's the most exciting holiday I 've ever spent and my favourite too .
I and my classmates with our teachers and other classes went to the cinema to see the film " Fantastic Boccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema to my class and see in a film what I have studied during the Italian lesson and understand better the stories of Boccaccio , one of the most important Italian writer .
Seeing the film we have had the possibility to watch the characteristics of the main characters of Boccaccio and the different places where the stories took place .
In my opinion the film was made in a very good way : the registers of the film ( they are two ) tell us five novels with only one main protagonist : the love in every situation .
The registers of the film said that they want to create a film without time , and they were able to create this .
The scenes of film , the costumes and the music are very beautiful and I suggest this film to all of my friends .
According to the past century , we have seen lots of change in the world .
It 's obvious that nowadays is really different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that the people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can think of what way of our lives is still inconvenient that it can probably change .
Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery , the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job , the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future .
There are some issues that make worried , the environment is getting worse , we have to come up with the methods to solve this and save our Earth .
The relationship among the countries is also significant , as we can see discord is among the countries , hoping that it will not draw the war .
television entertains as well as it will educate the people .
These days are educating themselves by watching the television .
Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe .
Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species .
Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people
When Michael wake up that morning he feels , a strange smell in the air , he do not know what is the origin of that strange smell but , in his noose , he receive a kind of sign something bad happened .
Very quickly he went of and try to put of his head of that sensation , but ... the smell , the feelings , the sign ... but " what ?

The diabetes is the increasing of the glucosa in the blood , The have two types , first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens , pacient needs insuline every day , also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person 's immuny siste .
The Diabetes Type 2 is present in adults people , the insuline is generated but this not work in the body , so the amounts glucose is storage in the body .
This diabetes is caused by the bad alimentation of the people or because the people have a bad life .
So it is necessary to eat vegetabl and fruist and also to do ejercises .
My view is that public transport is good because it has prevent pollution which is good for the public .
May people can think travelling by car is more comfortable for them .
if planned to travel by public transport people will walk to bus station and get down from the bus and walk for necessary thing .
So my opinion is good for both parties
Hope this message finds you in good health 

Bye I have to go .
I wrote to sponsorize my favourite sport , the most beautiful sport in the World ,
basketball is a complete sport , aerobic and anaerobic .
it 's a team sport , the team it 's made of 5 people and you need a ball and a hoop .
Some people say that basket it 's only for tall guys
but it is n't true , in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall
like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what
find only a ball and a hoop and play it .
If you want to start this sport , find a friend that can teach you the basic movements and how to pass and shot
than the practice makes the rest .
if you train and you have willpower nothing can stop you .
Nowadays basketball is spreading around the World .
I hope that the amount of players will increase and increase every day more .
so let 's play basketball .
At the moment he is doing three A levels at camden college .
At the weekend he usually plays football or basketball and this year he is learning how to roch climb .
School is finishing in two weeks and next summer he wants climbing in Scotland .
I have the best friend when I was a student at high school .
We studied hard together to prepare the university exam , shared about our problems and almost things has relatived with us .
It 's great time for me .
He seemed as my boyfriend .
The first year of the university , I showed my love to him .
I had an affair love .
Day by day , I tried to forget my love in his quiet .
I did n't call , send message and met him .
Although I did well for a long time , one day , he contacted again with me , so I did n't ignore him .
He said that he wanted to be the best friend as before .
But no , what I can do it ? I still love him , even my love become bigger .
What I should do ?
Should I show my love again ?
Last week from September 11 to September 21 , we had a minivaction .
From September 11 to September 14 , I did nothing besides watching TV , taking care of my little sister Ellie and chat with my friends .
On the rest of the boring week , I solved a 1000 pieces puzzles .
On Sunday , my family and I went to Causeway Amador then to Albrook Mall .
After the examns finished , I went home and had nothing to do , so I thought that I needed to watch my dramas because it was a week I haven't watch them due to the exam week .
From September 12 to September 14 , I was too lazy because I was tired of the exam so I was all day laying on the sofa doing nothing apart of watching the TV and chat with my friends .
Besides I needed to take care of my little sister Ellie , who is very cute and funny and right now she is always trying to get up and stand and walk .
On the rest of the boring week , I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet , so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister , which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I did n't finished then a year ago .
We began to solve it again and took us the whole week to finish it .
While solving the puzzle , I decided to count how much pieces was left , after counting them I realized that five pieces were missing .
I was too angre because I was finishing the puzzles and five pieces were missing so I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but did n't find it .
On Saturday , I finished my puzzle but with five pieces missing but I was happy too .
Also my uncle , aunt , grandfather and cousins went with us .
After arriving to the Causeway , my brother and my cousins went to drive bicycle for one hour .
I was hoping that my father can teach me to drive the car but was not possibly because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father did n't want to return to Causeway Amador to teach me drive .
Mini vacation can be fun but sometimes boring because you haven't planned anything for the vacation .
The best thing I did was to solve my beautiful Paris puzzles and went to Amador with my family and have a good time with them .
Mini vacation are a break for us to have a fun and good moment with our adorable and lovely family and friends .
when I was child , I wore usually blue , grey and red colours .
My bedroom is blue and orange , the colours of my toys when I was child are different .
I chose always my clothes because only me know my favourite clothes and when I was child my toys .
Now I wear different colours for example black , blue , grey and other .
Maybe they will change
I 'm sure you 'll agree Pompei is the most important archeological site in the world .
It was destroyed by a vulcanic eruption in 75 BC .
Vesuvium - this is the vulcano 's name ! - covered it with a lot of cinder so that walls , houses , food , clothes , corps of citizens has been preserved as well they were .
You can walk through the same streets and enter in the same shops the romans entered some centuries ago !
It is n't incredible ?
Besides is possible to book special tours in which there are guides dressed like pompei 's citiziens .
There is an unique athmosphere !
In my opinion anyone could n't come to Italy without visiting Pompei .
Especially in urban , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT , it 's fast , cheaper and does n't have to find the parking lot .
Besides , it 's harmful and makes earth environment more worse for emission so much carbon dioxide .
That will cause the global warming .
But , if you live in the country , car may be essential , because it 's will spend so much money to buy the tickets if their family have many people .
So , I think the government should have to draw a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban and counry .
And think deeply the problem about protecting the environment .
I love my small family .
If any problems faced , i 'm went to my parents and say the problem , there are solve the problem .
My parents are the good guides .
There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs , it 's very happy moments .
My mammy told the story in night .
Mom make the special foods in festivals .
my family is a nuclear family .
Steve Ramsay work in the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D and live in Washington D.C. after the Battle of New York .
Someday , an S.H.I.E.L.D. 's agent was attacked by the ghost .
After that Steve become an America captain to protect the world again .
He meets a strong opponent who is winter soldier when he wants to find out the wirepuller .
Besides to be an excellent exercise , is also the more comfortable , because it allows me to concentrate , to be with myself , talking and praying to God in each step in the morning .
I woke up 5H00 o'clock in the morning ,
I consider this is the best time to do sport , taking into account that the pollution is down at that time .
There is not so much traffic , and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers , land , the First , I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park .
What I really enjoy it is to lie in the grass .
It is in this moment when I get to talk to God .
I feel that he is near to me that he listens to me every word that I pray .
Doing so , I begin my routine day , come back home , begin to do my breakfast , followed by the lunch , because I have to get to work at 9H00 o'clock .
It is an activity that goes according to the capacity of each one , that doing it each morning improvement our health and move away all the bad of our body .
The graph below gives information about seasonal sales for ice - cream of different places in ice cream van and indoor swimming pool in Jan to Dec .
Overall , average of 5000 dollars of year about ice cream van .
In addition , indoor swimming pool sales have a slightly declining from 2012 to 2014 .
First , the graph showed an upward trend to ice cream van , and in 2014,it has the largest percentage of sales nearly 5500 dollars in Jul - Sep .
No matter what year , its lowest level always in Jan - Mar .
May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold , the purchaser greatly reduced .
We can be seen from the diagram , the highest peak in the has increased year by year , as the low as .
Second , for indoor swimming pool , it generally appear wavy falling , from 2500 dollars in 2012 to 2000 dollars in 2014 . We can infer , it will not rise sharply , and it is impossible to fall sharply .
Most people like to have their own car , because they think is more comfortable and flex .
You can go out from your house and take your car park and leave to your job and park very close .
But I think that the future is the public transport , we need preserve nature , this is an imperative for our world , then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport , so the people do n't need to get a car for being able to have a job and do n't need it for normal development of their lives .
As well , we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs , because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job , maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres , as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going there by a bicycle .
Maybe this sound a bit crazy , but whatever solution will be good , we only must make our minds up for able to look across .
What the fine weather today !
It 's April now , and spring is finally .
The sun shines bright , snow has melted in the March .
Birds returned from warm countries .
They sing joyfully and build the nests .
They feel tired after long snowy winter .
In the March we set forward our watch an hour ago .
Summertime was first converted in 1900 year .
Days are getting longer but night are getting shorter and lighter .
We convert our watches an hour ago in October .
It 's pleased some people because they will be able to sleep an hour more .
I like spring and always wait for it and wait for summer holidays with impatience .
Summer is really little life .
As soon as I pass all exams I will travel .
As they say in English proverb < travel broadens the mind>. In summer you can switch off of daily routine , relax , have a talk with friends .
I did n't decide as yet where I will spend the summer .
It became a big problem now .
However I am stopped last tragic developments in foreign countries .
I think , it 's better and safer to go to Black sea , to Crimea or to Kuakas .
My friends have bought ticket to Sochi yet .
It 's possible , I will join them , because I have never been in Sochi and everyone should visit this wonder city one time of their life .
Well , I 've played martial arts .
They 're more for self - defense but for what I do , and my way to stay healthy , is martial arts and running .
I would suppose I would have to say , in Japan Sumo is my favorite sport for watching .
I would have to probably be three times as big as I am to even begin to qualify for something like that but , yeah , I enjoy watching it a lot .
I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport , because until my back 's injury , I practiced other sports , I most like extreme sports like downhill , skateboarding martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it .
The think because I enjoy these sport is I feel free when I am in the water , it is so relaxing and I red it is the most completely sport because you work the whole body .
If you want to start swimming I think you should looking for a swimming teacher because if ca n't swim , you must need it , and if you can swim but not well , if you are not on practice and know your swim style is not the best I recommend you a professional assistance .
More time that you do n't have that assistance is going to be more difficult improve your style and enjoy swimming more because if you really know how to swim are going to have more resistance in the water .
She works at a language school in local University .
I think , that may the reason she had the Sleep Paralysis last night .
In Korea , we call it ' Ka - Wee - Nool - Rim ' which means being pressed by ' Ka - wee ' ghost .
Yes , she actually felt as if someone was pressing down on her chest by hands .
Even she was not able to lift single finger tip as if she was turned into a stone statue .
Then , she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her as standing just beside bed .
She was so scared and frightened .
She tried screaming and calling me who was sleeping peacefully beside at her .
She could n't open mouth , say anything at all .
Even worse , two of them started whispering on her ears , die … die ..
I was watching a YouTube clip by my iPad .
She reproached me for not awaking her up despite she had been calling me so eagerly .
It was just a dream , very real like .
Most of those dreamers claim that it is like real .
They think they really opened eyes and awaken since it is too vivid and detailed .
Often they explains and describe the scene in detail like a cup on table , friends who watching TV beside them , room light and so on .
But nothing is real . They realize that no cup is on table , no one is at room , and the light is off .
Commonly , the dreamers say that they ;
- experience when they are so tired physically and so stressed .
- feel drowning down when they are about falling in sleep(so they know it will happen )
- feel a lot of press on body and can not move in dream .
- see someone or some people as standing beside or riding on them .
- repeatedly dream again if they rarely awake themselves .
Some experience so easily and often .
Most scary case I heard is that the ghost pulled hair into under bed as stabbing chest with a sharp gimlet .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he has to do something immediatele .
He had forggoten to go to his English classes .
It was half past seven and her class begun fifteen minutes ago .

I think that the public transport always going to be so important in our life because not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car , so for that reason the public transport in the future could be exist , because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport

Military service is people who is forced by the government be a part of the army to serve and protect the country .
There are many countries which should be complete the military service when people who reach 18 such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore .
The duration of the military service should be around 12 mouths to 20 mouths .
Also , there are different sections of training during the military service people generally do a lot of training to their obedience or how to use the weapons .
Thus , there is a cause of agreement and another cause of disagreement which is freedom of choice and mental maturity .
As this topic , the one of the reason of everyone should not have to complete the military service because the freedom of choice .
Some people may think it seem to be a human rights that let the people to choose if they want to join the military .
Otherwise , when the people are forced by the government , they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted .
So some counties would not force the people to join military .
In contrast , it could be the benefit that improves their mental maturity .
If people join the military service when they just 18 , it may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who work in the military may request to the soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
For instance , they usually need them to fold up a quilt in a specified angle or there is specific time that you must wake up and get sleep .
People should not be complaining about anything even if they seem to be right .
But after a period of time , people could develop their obedience especially to the young people ; they will be likely to become a more independent person .
To conclude with both sides , there are reasons to effect by people should or should not have to complete military service .
However ; the effects may different which is base on how length of the duration .
Hi mum and dad
The museum and the art gallery located in the capital city .
I really like antiques even though it is not much to look at .
They have some paintings of Leonardo da Vinci which is really impress me .
My favourite part is listened to a guide introduce to panting art .
I ca n't wait to back home and tell you more about the trip .
In my city , we have not a regular care for the environment .
There have been many projects to improve the caring of the environment .
But there is a big problem : the people 's culture .
In my country you can do a lot of efforts to take care of the environment , but the bad culture in our people is a great problem .
That is because we do n't demonstrate interest in the problems of others .
We think that our authorities are responsible for these themes .
Then , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
The people put their rubbish in bags and threw it away near their houses .
They do n't spend money in a good container .
Then , the dogs can break the bags and eat the rubbish .
In this way the streets are always dirty .
In my case , I prefer to have a clean Street .
It does n't matter if I lose time putting the bags with rubbish in a good container .
If everyone 's demonstrate a better culture , it is possible to improve our environment .
Nowadays we grow up with the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
This fact allows young people do exercise and enjoy at the same time .
Do team sports also help to meet other people and make new friends .
Favorite sport of many people is football , instead of my favorite is basketball .
I started to play it when I was twuelve years old and currently I still love this sport .
My main reason for love it is how you feel when play a match and finally your team win .
Also , I known great friends who play basketball .
Every sport focus on some parts of the body , however basketball is the most complete sport .
It is true that basketball require a lot of physical activity , but a good mental attitude is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed because you do n't get any point or have a bad day , due to the other players can sympathise with you .
If it happen , you will continue doing the best as you can .
To reach this , I recommend do exercise three times a week and follow a healthy diet .
Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody 's whole life ..
turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult , perceiving the other side of life , how tough and complicated it is , trying to deal with its different circumstances ..
at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life , many questions spinning in your head , accusing yourself of being a lost cause , wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it 's all no good ..
then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality , which sucks ..
life is stages , this stage of your life is timeless , no way out ..
at some point you wish if it was all illusio , you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life ..
However .. here you are completely different made of life lessons , preferring to make a stiff upper lip .. cowering in your own reality .
Television can improve knowledge on current affairs .
Education does n't lie on current affairs or related concepts .
Television helps us to find the fields that interests us , like music , sports , movies or nature .
These days television allows us to see happenings all around the world .
However , there are quite a lot of disadvantages of television .
Especially , the fake news spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how to make use of the opportunity .
Watching TV seems to be top on our list of things to do after a long hard days ' work with a hot cup of tea in dark winters .
TV were and are seen as entertainment channels , but have you ever questioned if they are more then just entertainment ?
Now that would be an interesting question , we can watch anything from news to cat fish the TV show , in the name of entertainment are actually learning .
The truth is we are always learning , but how we learn is another matter , there main type of learners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV stimulates at two learning style which is visual and auditory .
Some may argue that TV just does not have sufficient content for us to be able to learn , other may argue that TV is an amazing source of learning . i.e we learn about new technology via a mobile phone advert air on TV .
We learn about social values , World news etc .
I have personally picked up information I would not have come accross other wise for example , I have be able to learn that new BMW seven series , has ambiance lighting , it can pull in and out of the garage at the touch of a button , it 's computerises system can read different road surfaces and adapt it 's drive .
so have you ever asked yourself Television entertains , but can it also educate .
Blues , Rock n Roll , folk music were the basis for the new music .
1966 - 1967 the huge change takes place .
The 3 musics were even known in 1963 .
Every music express other feelings .
And after this everybody started to change there type of music .
Than the music hanged to multi media .
And so changed the old music to the new music .
The circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanes which makes it possible to achieve high - speeds .
Drivers drive the cars with full throttle for over 75% of the lap , longer than the other circuits .
In my opinion riding at high - speed on the long straight can be cause overheating the cars engines and the can blow up .
The rugged kerbs can cause the suspension crack .
The falling leaves can be block driver 's view and block up the radiators .
I think cutting trees which around the circuit and undercutting kerbs can be reduce danger and technical problem on the track and we have to reduce long straights .
Global power and politics are now surprisingly centered to those , which have an apex maturity of science .
Addiction to authoritative nature over other makes a huge production of war weapons convert the blessing nature of science into critics .
Despite all of the assistance of science in daily life , it has not without criticism in different views .
Science replaces human labor into instrument , but what about happiness ?
There is no definition of happiness in scientism or how could it get through the scientific user manual .
Very often , it has criticized to change indigenous cultures into so - called luxurious development , contradictory to religious faith .
Science is concerned only with the information about the world whatever it is , and sometimes in unethical conclusion without considering the morality .
It occupies so pivotal a role in modern society and commands so much public money , should find itself subject to criticism from a variety of source .
But living 21st centaury , its difficult to blame science where we are benefited through its technological applications on everyday our life to an ever - great extent .
My country is pretty clean compared to the cities and countries that I know although there are a few pieces of paper or plastic on the streets , but residents have a great respect for nature .
In fact , they keep the woods clean and the owners sent the loggers to remove dead trees now or those that could lead to hazards , but every time you remove a tree , is immediately put a young plant so that the environment does not undergo changes that will lead out balance the system .
For waste management across the country , even in the countryside , they were placed the bins for recycling paper , plastic , glass and waste .
Three times a week garbage trucks pass to empty them , and once a week a garbage collector passes to clean up the streets .
Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs , in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport , now , we can afford any of those modern car at the agency .
The future of the public transport is fading away , you might ask why .
the main problem is the bad service , for example , the drivers are not careful enough to drive , that might be unsafe for the users .
another disadvantage is the unclean chairs in the transport .
Those are the main reasons that could make the public transport diseappear .
I consider the best option to buy a car so we can feel safe .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children do physical activity that is the first step to do exercise , then to compete sports will make competitior to make an extra effort .
Also , just for young children that are in process of growth and development , physical exercise is essential to do it , because they can have a healthier life .
Young children try to effort , and wants to win at this age , and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training .
In psychic way , if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends .
In the future , adults that was able to obtain more achievements and make it more responsible , and you can have a good social life , if you competes doing sports .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
But , some people do not think this like this and take it more simply
Finally , I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life .

Moreover , the goods is quite cheap .

First of all Television has less viewers now days .
Most of the people turn to the Internet website or applications like Netflix or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to those days when young people still watch television for entertainment .
Most of the people watched news , movies , or tv shows on television .
Also there was a lot of different channel that we chose .
As I remember there were educational channel like Discovery and National Geography .
Those channel always content a lot of new technology .
For some people may think that only these kind of channel can provide educational knowledge and for some people they do n't consider watching these channel as entertainment .
For these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational .
But I wo n't opine that these are the only channels that can provide knowledge .
All kinds of shows can give you all kinds of different knowledge even when you watch movies .
But of course there will be some channel that is not suitable for child under 18 or just for adult .
As I think there is no channel that you ca n't learn form it .
All kinds of programs have something that you can think about just depend on how you look at it .
Yes of course but only when you look at it as a way you wanna learn something .
My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide , but also has to many good things , for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world , when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country , that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country , but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun .
I think that a complete sport is to swim for most of the people .
I really enjoy because give me a lot of relax and it help me to be tonic and satisfied myself .
I advice peolpe to start this sport , because is completely and make you mind with the body feel very good .
When I was fourteen years old , I win the championchip because in that period I swam as agonistic atlet .
It had been a really satisfation and I had been happy .
Nowadays I 'm really grateful to my parents because they have spent money for me and I have to thanks them .
I think this sport is the most completely compared to the other sports .
Your muscles begin more efficient and tonic and you have a lot of benefits for the body .
The aim of the report is to write how are town take care of the environment .
I do a research and this are findings .
We have a lot of bins around the area , so now we can throw our litters whenever we are .
Also we have recycle bins for paper and glass .
We do everything to make our town more green , our citizens always have new ideas that make the difference of our daily life .
It is common that more and more people get overweight , caused by too much fastfood and unhealthy lifestyle .
Now some scientists have suggest to having warnings on some types of food and drink .
But is this idea a way to reduce the bad habit of consume noxious foodstuff ?
On the one hand I ca n't imagine that a little scine on the food people entrap to stop their shopping and read the warnings .
First of all , we need to make people aware of the current environmental situation in order to do activities that help the environment .
To begin with , we have to try to use as little as possible the car or the bus and try to get at any place walking or by bicycle .
This action would decrease the gas emitted to the environment .
In addition , the water issue is another big problem .
Nowadays , people is wasting water instead of saving it .
One basic solution for this point is try to not take a shower for so much time but taking it with a bucket and a few minutes .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it in the following types : metal , plastic , organic , glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman .
However , we also have to try to not create more rubbish recycling most of them .
For example , the organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer , the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory as well as the glass .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do not decide to take our part in this global problem .

As we 've seen these days that the amount of cars is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increasing in number of private cars .
Governments around the world have talking a lot about the measures should be taken to improve public transport quality .
No doubts travelling by car is pretty much better than go by public bus .
although Louis felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
I was manager at retail store .
Everyday work stressed me and by the end of my shift I get so tired .
The program I start at school was very tough for me , because my slow English writing .
I do not have very good english writing skill .
My grammar and spellings are week .
I am struggling in school .
I am trying my best hope I will pass my course and get a good job .
I 'm really sorry , you ca n't come over because my father is at the hospital for 14 days .
The future transport is the public , because the traffic it will be less .
When the people travel by car is for work , holidays or for other motive .
We should use the less car , it is very pollutant .
I will start with old transport , if we did n't make any maintenance this type will be damaged and lose it .
In the future , every person will use his car and no need for public transport.this type of transport have a path and just take you for specific places and you ca n't use it to go to small streets .
But in some country , You can use underground ( metro ) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi , The underground is faster and clean and arranged .
About pollution , it is a big issue in public transport , with time if you try to fix the machine of public transport that will be coste , because with time the live age of this machine will finish .
Michael is a man of 22 years , he has studied the career of electricity engenieer and now he wants to put into practice his knowledge .
He went to buy a newspaper to search for a job , he was looking all the advertisements but he never found the one he nedded .
Michael though that it was time to do something .
He could not be at home all day doing such nothing so he started to look for another job that would be suitable for him .
When he was a kid he wanted to work in a videogames shop so for his good luck it was available a job at Play Station store .
Of course he does not think twice and go for print his curriculum because the interview was that day , then he took a shower and dress for the occasion .
He prepared something to eat fast , brushed his teeth , he just took his mobile , keys and money but he had n't noticed that he was forgetting of his curriculum .
It is an interesting activity!There is Fifa world cup too !
There are soccer lessons .I have joined the lesson .
First , the teacher will train us soccer technique .
But we will break our legs .
He is tall and smart he looks like a movie star .
My father has many hobbies , he plays foot ball , reads newspaper and listens to Radio .
In my opinion , family is more important than friends , but probably I spent more time with my friends than family . I know if I need something my family is always there .
The difficult is that you rarely know if your best friend is a true friend .
Unfortunately , my best friend deceived me , I do n't know how she managed but she hurts me .
My cousins are very reliable like my grandmother and my parents .
The family has a link blood therefore you have a natural empathy .
For all rules have exceptions .
You need to discovered who is your best friends . Lifelong you will learn who is who .
grown up with me and now she is my sister too .
My city is Jaén it 's in the east of Andalucia and is an important cross ways between the south and center os Spain .
So an important historical place is the St. Katherine 's castle .
This is an old castle of 10th century and the style is Arabian .
It 's over a high hill with difficult slopes to arrive because the most important property is it impregnable .
In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault , finally the Castellan 's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it .
Then in the 18th century the Napoleonic army lived in it until the end of independence Spanish war .
The French army before came back to France destroyed it .
Actually the castle has been restored and has a historic museum , also have a great hotel with four stars for tourists .
I like this place because I can enjoy a good views to my city .
We speak most of the time , so it is good to develop our confidence and fluency to converse .
plane , train , and boat are the ways to travel .
I think the boat is the best way to travel and I have three reasons for my idea .
First of all , boat moves across the sea and the sea is very beautiful .
For instance , when we move on the sea , we can see many types of animals , such as birds , turtles , and fishes .
Next , the boat usually is very big , so we can do many activities on it , such as dancing , drinking .
Finally , It is the safest way for travel , because we do not have many dangers , such as crashing , falling any other kinds of danger in the sea .
Therefore , I prefer the boat to travel , instead of the train or the plane .
All in all , travel in the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable , in addition , it is very safety .
Have you ever practised rafting?Do you know how amazing is to do this cool sport?If you do n't know nothing about it , it 's high time to do it !
I had n't never heard about doing rafting until my best friend , Carmen , told me whether I wanted to have a whale of a time with her and I accepted it .
Therefore , we went to join in a sports centre which take over organising this stunning outdoor activity .
Rafting get you burn all your adrenaline whereas you try to get down over the river in a mini - boat .
In addition , you 'll enjoy a breathtaking landscapes around you and you 'll also see a vast range of wildlife in both sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clothes and to bring protection cream with you .
In contrast , you could suffer some nasty cuts or , even though , being sunburnst .
Do not hesitate taking up rafting !
You wo n't regret !
In my life I have had a big experiences that have made me change and mature .
One of the most important experience I think was coming to study to Tijuana .
It was a really challenge for me to live alone .
Before I came here I was so dependent of my parents and I had a lot of fear , but I learned to overcome all the things that stopped me .
When I was child I used to live in Tijuana .
When I had 4 years I went to live to Ensenada because my father worked there .
Since I was born to my 18 years old I was living whit them , but now I live in a small apartment .
I am studying Nutrition at the University , that is why I am living in Tijuana .
I used to live in assistent house it was my first place where I lived in Tijuana , then I changed to an aparment with two friends .
All weekends I used going to Ensenada for visiting my family , my boyfriend and my fiends .
Before I came to live to Tijuana , I was really nervous because I had to leave everything and because it would be a change in my life .
For summit , came to live to Tijuana was a really challenged for me .
I do not regret what I did because I do what I like .
Now I am so independent and I learned how to live alone .
I live in a small village on countryside with few people .
Even if we are a country , we take care of the environment through the use of photovoltaic systems on roofs of many houses , such as the nursery school and other houses that have this systems to produce energy .
We separated paper from glass and also to plastic .
The garbage picks up paper once a week , plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country .
My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community .
All people of the world have friends , I 'm not an exception .
When I was 10 years old I met my best friend .
We 're friends since we start to talk , but our friendship has change over the time .
When we were 12 we played in the garden with the balls and with the other boys and girls , but when we were 12 years everything changes we do n't want to play in the garden because we preferred cinema or watching TV .
Because of age changing we did n't see us , but in the moment that we grew up more , we met us the weekends and sometimes we 're upset about some problems that we had .
With the time we are more friends .
Now , we discuss sometimes but we love us because he always stay together in the good moments to take a coffee or talk about our lives , but he also stay in the bad moments , despite being friends since we were 10 years old .
For this reason I think that friendship is so important thing in the life .
I think the opposite , I believe that public transportation has a really huge future .
It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but , and that amount is growing up ; as well there are a lot of people that do n't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price , because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car , because the traffic , some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster .
The population is growing up so fast , we need public transportation , is important .
Public Transportation is convenient for some people and some people think is more convenient the car , finally we will need public transportation on the future .
In our opinion globalization is a good thing that happen to us , allow us to interact with all the world , so we can meet the cultures , monuments , etc .
It bring us a lot of opportunities to change and in some cases to get a better life in other countries like find a job with the highest salary .
Although we need to change some things in the world , more than these is to change a lot of things in the third world countries , because it is not acceptable that in the twenty - first century a person live with less than a dollar per day .
I 'm writing of my summer job at the Cinema .

I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English , if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write , but I think that speaking is most important than writing , because when you go to anyplace in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you ; in this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you would n't unsderstand anything ; but here is another topic , whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to realize what the person is trying to say .
According to your e - mail , we discovered the price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .
Please be advised that the right amount on the settlement date .
Awaiting for your amendment as soon as possible .
Ride bicycle is my favourite sport .

It is clear that technology has provided us with several options in communication .
Perhaps the clearest example of this is that unlike the past , it is not necessary to buy envelops and stamps to send the letter .
Another way this change is evident is that social networking or applications such as Skype , FaceTime and Facebook are widely used to stay in touch with their family , friends and relatives

If we want to have a good life , we must make good communication in our families
I live in the one of the most beautiful countries - Ukrane .
When I was at school my friends and I attended unior swimming school .
I was 30 years before .
My friend and I always had ice creame and fun after training .
I work at office and have no ideas where are my friends .
This year I decided to star visiting pool and swim up to three times a week .
Now , when I swim at the open pool , I am overfilled by positive emotions .
Nowadays the obtion of broaden the ming traveling is very commun .
In my opinion I think that it is not the only way but it is the best way .
Apart from that you see new places and you have fun , you also lern others cultures , historicals facts , you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums .
In addition you do n't think in yours problems and the only thnig that you do is have fun and do what you whant to do .
Besides you see new world and thirs form of lives and that helps to open you mind , see the world in other way .
In conclussion I think that it is the best way to opemn your mindn not the only way but yes the best way .
many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming , In schools teachers are doing their best to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy , also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,
Although government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages , in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city , also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive .
First of all , I disagree with that statement , because of these reasons I am about to give .
Once we stop using Public transport , it is going to causes problems .
For example , if we completely relaying to use cars it is going to increase the gasoline uses .
Apparently it is going to make more pollution more global warming issue .
How ever , using cars makes the life easier but when everyone or every house they will own at least three cars it is too much .
Although the traffic jams the accidents etc .. .
public transport it is really important and it has a lot of advantages for helping humanity .
In my opinion every country they should have different kind of public transport
For instance San Francisco it is a great example for incredible city , the variety of choices in the public transport it is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilities it is going be expensive but it is necessary .
In conclusion , The governments should work on that because the people need the public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car .
I hope to see it around the world , public trans port something we can not avoid or replace with another thing .
Cars will be safer and speeder than now .
Traveling by car will be the best suitable
way to move from place to another .
Recommend to friends what country we have to go .
I would like to recoomand friends to visit Italy .
first of all , nowadays wherever we go we can find Italian restaurant easily .
There are a lot of food all over the world .
but I think Italian restaurant is getting famous .
Second , beautiful tourist places like a Venice .
I have been to Italy when I was 20 .
There is no word to explain .
Venice is city that is based on water .
There are no car , no metro in Venice .
On the other hand it could be complicated . but nobody complaint .
I think that 's why this city can maintain the safe environment .
It brings many fashionable people .
if you are person who love fashion you will enjoy going there .
so it makes me exciting .
so if you want to visit any country i 'm going to recoomend to Italy .
The biggest anecdote , that I have with my friend , was our trip to Disney world .
Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom , Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom .
In adittion we could visit others parks , like Universal and Bush Garden .
But this is not the end of our trip , we went on a voyage in a Royal Caribean cruise , where all the food and drink was free , because it was also paid .
During the voyage , we disembarked in the Bahamas and CoCo kay , which is a private island of the cruise , we went to the beach and played so many games .
To sum up , this trip was the best experience we have in our lives , because we make friends , visit a new country and we have a lot of fun .

I think in future is n't necessary to use the public transport and why ?
Simple , the new generation decided do take your driving licence and I saw this around me , my colleagues , my friends , my family .
It 's just a question of time when everybody will have a car .
This afirmation : travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything , for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny , the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer buy car it more practical and fast .
Do n't forget the cust .
In my opinion the price of the ticket on bus is expensive .
Every year the price of public transport turn it up .
We can stop and do a mental arithmetic and we can see a lot of many we spend one year .
If we have a car I believe we do n't spend much money .
It 's just my opinion because this is my life so I now what I am talking about .
Every months a buy my pass for use on the bus .
I am part of the new generation where in future use car and the public transport are disappear .
I 'm from Italy , I live in Varese a beautiful town not far from Milan in Lombardia .
Varese has many attractions between which the lake , where I like to stay .
My favourite place in the town is Estensi gardens , where I go to walk with my friends during the afternoon .
But Michael sometimes has problem .
He is proud , it 's not a good way .
On Saturday they fighted and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
public transport is important for anyone .
The people should walk more than before .
Nowadays , many accident happened when they were driving their car .
They are going to travel around all over the world by plane .
the young people feel happy more .
The author claimed that the business dropping causes by the increasing number of skateboarded users .
Likewise , the skateboarded users brought numerous garbage that affects the stores in the plaza .
Based on author 's two concern , the statement that drew a conclusion to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , it is a contradiction in the argument .
If more skateboarded users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
It is against author 's assertion .
From this point view , the decreasing of business should cause by other factors , but not skateboarded users .
However , there are many reasons can cause the business dropping .
Probably , the stores are too old in Central Plaza which could not attract customers walk into , and have to renovate .
Furthermore , the produce sales in the stores that could n't fit customers ' need .
Those above reasons could influence the business in Central Plaza directly .
Second , author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems appeal that there are not sufficient securities in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboarded users take over pedestrian walking space .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and divide the different space for walking and skateboarding .
To sum it up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboarded users would bring more potential to improve the business in Central Plaza .
On the other hand , the author should provide profound discussion why people come to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
The condition of the stores and safety are two crucial factors to affect the business in the plaza .
To strengthen author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above in the argument .
I have big family consists of three sisters and one brother .
but when comparing my family with my father 's family .

when my sisters are married they have one or tow children at most .I think the Egyption family became simller with the passage of time
The cocaine it 's the most dangerous addiction .
Firstly , cocaine damage your senses and your mind , if you consume cocaine , you wo n't sleep this day .
Secondly , it 's so addictive , because the body need more and more , so if you consumed cocaine , you would leave because you 'll an addict .
Finally , the consecuense of cocaine are the dead , if you sniff all the time cocaine or a lot , you die early .
In conclusion , cocaine it 's the most dangerous addiction , because you die early and your body it 's destroyed with the cocaine .
Yeah , fist time is ok .
But if you want I see some work in special , feel free to show me via note or mention ^^
There is an increasing trend of personal transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future .
ultimately public transport would be negligible in future .
there are so many reasons that could be affected to public transport system .
the main one is , nowadays people are dead busy with their day to day life so that they do n't like to spend their valuable time for waiting on the way for the regular transport . also public transport is experienced lots of pollution which is harmful for human being .
for example , lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system . as a result , they prefer personal transport system for prevent from such hazards .
finally public transport system is not safe as always .
to illustrate , If teenage girls travel by public transport every day who will interact with society beyond the limitation.so it is a big challenge to them .
To who ever it goes ,

The graph shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream in two places - one is from an ice - cream while the other is in an indoor public swimming pool , from 2012 to 2014 .
The line which represent the indoor swimming pool remain fairly steady , from approximately 1800 to 2500,the period of every year from April to June and October to December own the highest outstanding achievement , whilst the sale is downwards overall .
However , compared to the line of indoor swimming pool , the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large .
Overall , the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool , from about 1100 to 5500 .
The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn , while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool .
The discrepancy of these two place is large .
The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively .

With the rising prices for the public transport in London , commuters are choosing using their cars more and more .
Public transport was create to release the traffic in big town centres and also to facilitate workers commute .
Nowadays trains and buses are usually packed and the ticket fares are very expensive .
I particularly decided to drive to do my day to day tasks such as , shopping , visiting friends , church and so on .

We were happy with this .
My advice for someone who want to play this game , you do n't have to be tall or fast , when you play you have to think a lot .
I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work , you have to understand each other .
It 's really important to be tall because you will score point faster and better .
He is Polish basketball player .
He is really tall hi have 202 centimeters .
My story with basketball were very short .
I ca n't give you to many advice but one thing I know , a team work the most important thing in this game .
To begin , all is very difficult here .
First place , my country 's politics is bad , and people have not work .
In second place , there are very important people , and they want to have a lot of money .
Young people want to find a good job here , but they are working in mc donal 's or burguer king for a low salary .

Television is an essential part in our life , we turn it on nearly everyday , since it can make life more interseting .
There are two pionts to approve it .
For one , the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment .
Teleplay are not just for fun , it can have a deep meaning , short story tells big deal , just like a useful book .
So , why not television can not educate us ?
For another , there are many different types of programs , which can broaden our eyes , they give details of education , plus other meaningful information , such as documentaries , talk show and so on .
These programs are not just for killing the time , but for educating .
To sum up , television entertains , it ca also educate .
It has all kinds of food even the really fancy ones .

It 's a very nice restaurant which I prefer the most
Invention of car has made people 's lives easier .
No more they have to solely depend on public transport .
Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions , increase network .
But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey .
Public transport ca n't help when one has to travel suddenly or to go somewhere where it does n't pass through .
Those times car is convenient to use .
Ever increasing crowd in cities and thereby traffic problems are increasing .
In present times the houses is very different , but in the future houses will be
The future houses will be different not from architecture , but the functionality .
Different people will be needed different functions , options and functionality of the future house .
This will be like in ancient times , but in the past the houses was the same all round .
Progress of the technique is very fast .
From : horses , steam vehicle , first petrol and gas car to future cars when the drive will be electricty .

The public transport in the near future
Nowadays there are many ways to public transportation such as underground , buses , and etc . but is a reality that the people prefer to move by car .
Currently traveling by car is useful than public that transport , you can move around the city and reduce enough time sometimes you can share your car with friends or family and this way of transportation will be cheaper .
Teacher , I know to travel by car is the most convenient .
However , I think your mind is similar to what forebear thought , because for them , society are never going to get the transport we have nowadays .
It is difficult for us to imagine a world in which there are not cars like we are used to see .
Nevertheless , I trust in that technologies can suffer a progress in the future .
Moreover , we have still a lot of things which we can and must improve like travelling security , comfort and economic sources .
On the other hand , we should know that every means of transportation can be changed by 50 years later .
Maybe , we could find with flying cars or electric bikes .
For all that , I think that we should be prudent when we assess means of transportation .
According to Wordsworth a poet is not a common man , he has a greater sensibility and knowledge .
The power of imagination makes him become a teacher : he has to show men how to understand their feelings and the nature that surround them .
Sometimes I give some information about where the name of streets or where the main monuments are .
I have any particular problem to help them , but I have often some doubt to suggest the place to go for a shopping .
The reason is that in my city there are a lot of shopping facilities good for tourists .
An example could be to have a free entrance in the Campidoglio museum if you buy a local newspaper .
Also , there are some well - known brand ready to give a special prize if you but a souvenir after 8 pm .
As you see there are a lot of opportunities for the tourists to spend their own money in my city .
You have only choose what is the best for you .
You will not regret .

At first the police detective thought one of the special band was stolen the painting .

wasting time is a huge issue in our life . a lot of knowledges related to time such as : history , education and healthy .
We discuss special topic about how we come faster than a time.this famous quote explains my previous idea " time is a sword if you did not cut it , it will cut you " .
Many people do n't care about wasting their time even when they busy .
Actually , in my life I consider it as a king of my system who controls whole of my day .
there is some people treat time As something of my own , they have the right to wast it and the right to look after it .
In the oposit side , some people let the time control their life .
However we should be balance from the both types .
she wasted it she can not get it back .
Imagine how you will live if you do n't have knowledge called ' time ' .
I did not care to time I usually said this is my life and my time .
But this is change after my brother arranges with me to organize our time .
He will leave me at home or pay for him two riyals for every minute if I late to him .
When I ask him to get me someplace . I can not count how many times I stay at home because I am late .
I think that there is future for public transport , because there are still exist people who can not afford to buy a car , even travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to consider people need to earn sufficient money to support their families and be able to buy a car .

This issue is not clear - cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding career in our life .
I think that on balance it is more important to try to get satisfaction .
We work eight hours a day so if we submerge in a bloody pond in a long time could definitely turn ourselves frustrated .
In my own case , I am working as a co - cook in a diner .
Costumers ' satisfaction brings me happiness .
Although the heat in the kitchen could burn us , the smile on the customers gives the best courage .
Also , the satisfaction from the customers pushes me to work harder and be better on my job .
Job satisfaction could make us to purchase perfection .
The more I can perform the much I can gain .
As a result , job satisfaction is a good way to get better paid .
I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customer a fabulous dish .
On the whole , therefore , I feel that it is best to go for a career that we will enjoy if this is possible .

At the moment we have a nice house with the garden .
But what will be in the future ?
Possible we will in a space or underground .
In the future everything can change .
It can be painted with new colour .

But I think that not many change .
Probably houses will be smaller or bigger .
They do not look like big white ball .
Variety of negative impacts appears under rapid urbanization .
Urban flood is one of them .
Not only the growing impervious surfaces , but also the " false " green infrastructure contributes to it .
Mountains of studies demonstrated that green infrastructure is an economical , beautiful and effective strategy to control storm water .
However , urban flood keeps raging even when the amount of green infrastructure full fills the storm water control needs in some areas .
What is the obstacle that stopped these green infrastructures from providing the ecosystem service of mitigating and eliminating urban flood ?

This article is about how I think about the efficiency of public transport .
As I lived more than 12 years on the countryside I was dependent on busses and trains .
In the morning , I needed to get to school and in the evenings public transport helped me to get home .
I hold the opinion that a more frequent and more regular transport is needed .
Spontaneous activities were impossible as you always had to plan to advance .
I was hardly waiting for my 18th birthday .
I do agree television advertising direct toward young children should not bet allowed for several reasons .
First , this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable .
Kids around these age ( 2 to 5 years old ) do not have a maturated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them .
For instance , when I was three years old I used to be captivated for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed .
One of them was " the ultimate max steel " which was about a hundred dollars .
Secondly , I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child 's relationships .
It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial .
One example is what happened with / to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia .
One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy .
Unfortunately , my cousin did not have enough money to buy it , but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia , do not speaking well with her for three weeks !
In conclusion , I am strongly favourable to this statement . Advertisement for young kids , not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid 's vulnerability and the risk to their parents ' relationships with them .
In last case , if the advertisements were still exposed , It would be essential some educational politics come with them , valorizing and teaching kids on understanding their parents .
You have asked about a server in your cafe .
I think , it 's a great job for me .
I 'm very talented to work with people .
In my education at school , i learned to cook and to wait a table .
Also I can work long hours .
In another job before , I worked per day for 8 ours .

If you are looking for a movie to see , I recommend you " Nemo " , it 's the most beautiful Disney 's movie .
The story is about a couple of clownfish who are attacked by a shark , only the dad and one baby egg survived .
The baby name was nemo .
When Nemo grows up , he goes to his first school day , there he is going to be captured by a man .
The only thing they found was a pair of googles that said the direccion of the man .
Nemo 's father knowns a fish called Doris that wanted to helped him , they cross all the ocean to go to Nemo 's location to save him , while Nemo tries to survive in a dentist house .
They finally meet and get happy again with a lot of good friends .
When I was young I tried Badminton , Squash and Teakwondo .
I do n't do sport now ,
It is a fact that pollution is the one of the biggest concernment of advanced world .
The reason can be attributed to increased consumeristic nature and unware about waste management .
In the following paragraphs , am going to analyze these issuses in a detailed way to provide solution .
I 've fully understand why is so difficult finding which activity is more important for You .
I think I would have the same perpelxity .
However sometimes we need to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
As you know I am a person who likes sport and music , but if I have to decide which of those activity are more important then I would prefer sport .
I think the physical activity can give us more profit in our life .
For example if You are active every day , you can keep your health in good condition .
Sport activity also make us feel more flexible and ready to force every day .
In conclusion I think you should give up your music classes .
Nowadays cars are more affordable than ever .
With the development of the technologies , people will use other means of transport .
Having in mind that the society is also changing , people will tend to choose their place of work , which is near their home and wo n't need to spend time travelling .
We are witnessing a great development of the work from home these days , which will also lead to fewer people using public transport .

When study hard at the high school you will be
By looking at current situation of people 's lives , we can imagine the changes that can occur in future .
People are not interested in physical exercise & healthy food instead they are very much interested in earning money .
With no physical exercise & Healthy food people are damaging their health and family relations .
Now a days nobody has enough time to spend with family , Rather they prefer to make more money by working extra hours
If people live the same way as now , in future people will be considered as working robots instead of human beings .
For some reasons , I really liked to play basketball , first , playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second , my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork .
If you play the basketball and enjoy the game , you just go to the basketball gym with a basketball , trying to throw the ball into the basket again and again .
Three paradigms result from the attempt to characterizing epistemologically Spanish tourism research through the study of the AECIT Conference proceedings .
Not everyone has car , so public transport is needed for every country .
Public transport is helping people to get work on time and help to reduce pollution .
Also , for low income families , they could n't afford to buy new cars , then transposition will help them to survive .
Public transport is also reduce the daily traffic .
it helps people to keep track their schedule .

Currently , I stand at Syntagma square in Athens and it 's tremendously hot weather ! The sun is literally burning ! I 'm going to have a meeting with other international volunteers here in an hour .

I get in touch with you to inform him that from November 1 different activities will be carried out in Caceres to attract numerous tourists of different places .
There will be leaflets , cartels at its disposal , in which it will be able to find museums , churches , exhibitions .
Also , this year Caceres is the gastronomic capital , therefore they will find typical menus with products of Extremadura in its restaurants .
The best thing it is what stay for visiting .
If it has some doubt , do not hesitate to contact with me .
We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport , if so , we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office , city , home and so on using private transport , however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car , thereby , if we use a public transport , we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time .
A comparison between people who like to use a public transport and private transport shows that first one can save money and time but also they are in relax much more than people who use private transport .
I hope that those people who wrote this article can change their thought and can likely to write a very useful article .

In modern growing world , The basic needs of general public are increasing day by day and their expectations on quality of life took a new dimensions .
When we were in our childhood , we used to deal with public transport for going one place to another because that was only a cheaper option available .
But today , Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life , Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory .
A car can help him to go anywhere and anytime in much less time as compared to public transport .
I believe , as soon as Automobile sector develop new technology in cars people will more keen to use their own vehicle instead or public transport .

The first reason is no other than generation gap .
What is more , parents always consider their child best .
Parents often compare child to others also plays a role in this case .
As far as I know how to better understanding between parent and child .
According to the present situation it is a pity that their relative influence happiness family .
Therefore it is an important that we should cerebrate this problem .
The sum up the above argument , we should take some measures and have positive attitude .
On the one hand , we may take a communication forum , it can share everyone 's cerebration .
On the other hand , we should stand in other point and think their reasons .
Only by talking your points with your parents can prove all the problem .
Furthermore talking with parents can provide argued with them .
All in all , if you were to do this , your parents will not blame for you .

Although I knew that there is some conflication between England and Scotland , but the vote has really shocked me .
However , just as I thought , more than 50 percent Scots voted ' no ! ' , so Scotland did n't separated from the United Kingdom .
- This goes without saying cars are much more convenient than late trains , but I can not agree with the overall statement although I do abhor using public transport .
I have been travelling with both for yeras , and I reckon each and everyone ends up needing public transport one day or another .
I would be a tad oblivious thinking vehicle ownership is granted beforehand when younger .
As a grown - up now , I know full well how more affordable public transport is albeit less than before .

Compared with the past when we use horse for transportation .
Did the people have the same opinion that there is no future for transport , and we only can use horse ?
The reason for why we have such improvement is that the technology and innovation have changed our life .
Cars replaced the horse , and even plane have replaced the cars for long distance transportation .
So I think there will be future for public transportation , and this may because of the updated technologies .

when they were in the hospital because Fernanda foodbone , they gave her some chicken soup with a ladle , so she could drinker easily , she started feeling much better so they decided her mom and Daniela to leave Fernanda on their house so she could get some rest and so she could ate more chicken soup , because they want Fernanda to feel better .
Daniela 's mom and her returned to the park , to continued piking the trash from the grass .
Later they went to see a grotesque stroke , after Fernanda crying called Daniela 's mom because she also felt bad with the chicken soup , and she wanted to know in how much time they 'll returned to their house .
So Daniela 's mom and Daniela arrived at home at 11:00pm it was obscure and they would n't me able to see Fernanda , on that time the light turned off , and they try to put them on but the lights did n't turn on .
They slept , at the next morning they light turned on , and they saw Fernanda standing in front of them very tired of waiting them , so she get angry with them and went to her room and she did n't come out from her room .
Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem , so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late , so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine , and her mother told the police that she does n't have alcohol or wine on her car , and they police did n't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car , and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she did n't have nothing so they , went from there to their house and it was late , so that 's the reason .
She had allude the police before that she did n't have anything on the car .
When Fernanda came out from her room , she started prying on her mom wallet if she did n't have anything about the police or something and she did n't have anything so she forgave her .
But Fernanda summoned up the courage to ask her if she was n't telling any lies to her , and her mom told her that she vow that is n't any lie .
thanks a lot for your respond .

We are married couple , both 32 years old , live at the moment in Flims in Kanton Graubünden .

Looking forward to hear from you and wish you a nice day .
If I told you that , Travelling with a car or by bus , which one you will pick .
a lot of people nowadays will take their own car , it 's easier and flexible .
But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going ? , that 's because of the people that changing their mind , they start like having their own way to travel , Privacy also an important reason , people need to have a private means of transportation .
that 's why there is no future for public transport

My favourite sport is football , the principal reason why I like it is because when I was younger , I played with my friends and we got together to play every day .
I remember those years and I would like that my children will practise it when they will be oldest , an interesting sport .
My favourite team in Spain is Real Madrid , the best team .
If I were football player , I would like played in this team , but I think that it is very difficult because , only the best players gets it .
Nowadays I like others sports to practise : tennis , Basketball , ... but I prefer playing football with my mates on weekends , and then we drink some beers in the pub to celebrate the victory or the defeat .
These moments are very special and I hope to be able to enjoy for many years .
Finally I recommend this sport for the child in order to get a healthy life , get together with their friends and forget for much time alcohol and drugs .
I love sports and I believe to practise it is the best to get a good life .
I am here to write about a composition about public transportation in Somalia specially the capital city Mogadishu where there is a little public transport comparing to our neighboring countries . there is a scarcity of public transport and there is one type and model which Van as well as very distracted roads which may cause collateral damage .
Sometimes passengers and drivers face risks and road blocks which usually happen when the Somali government leaders are travelling across the city and even abroad .
So having good infrastructure helps a lot and constant peace and the people of Somalia will not suffer any more .

As for as public Transport you can save fuel as well as pollution but it take more time to reach the destination .
while if you have your own conveyance you can save time and moreover it is safe .
the most important thing is there would be huge traffic on the roads and traffic movement will be very slow .
but keeping in view of environment we should prefer to use public transport

It is clean and environmentally friendly city .
The city has its own public transportation system , waste management system .
People live here take care of city environment , so the city became clean and green place .
The city contain about thirty public parks .
The parks are full of greenery ; these parks also used as playground for children .
Trees in the parts are not sufficient as per requirement of our city .
Ten year before , local governing body of the city decide to plant more tree and it asked advice from the citizens of the city about the proposal .
We planted trees near side of highway , unused lands , and outside of the city .
Now these trees are grownup .
It give shades , shelter to animals , and purify air .
The trees are also stop soil erosion in rainy season .
Our city have a well equipped waste management system .
Each house in the city have two verity of dustbin to keep recyclable and non - recyclable items separately .
In Morning , waste collection truck came and it take these waste .
These waste materials are processed with environmentally friendly .
The last film I saw was not new , in fact it was " The Others "
The others is a film that is based on a family that lives in a house and in this where many strangers things happen .
The principal character is Grace that is the mother of her two children Nicholas and Anne .
The hudsband of Grace is called Charles .
In the film there were servants , they were Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
Charles has to go to the war and Grace and her sons stayed in that house but not they were not alone they were with Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
The problem is that the mother started to listen many wear sounds and her sons were not doing them , so who was the responsible .
Her sons have a problem they ca nt see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants , so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys .
Then many things happened , and then they discover that the ghost were not the servants .
Of course I recommend this movie , because it is very interesting and in some parts is funny too , and Nicole is the principal character so I love it !
In my opinion I do not agree with what journalists do , or to me if I were a movie star , a famous man who has done many performances I do not like every hour of the day to be pursued by journalists .
In addition , everyone wants to have a moment of privacy and because journalists papparazzi can not have a moment to relax , tutoring for children or dependent on what else you want to do it and you can not because journalists .
And another reason why I have so right in what I had to say in the ranks above you feel if you were in game then people are always these people and destroy families because they declare false Intrigue sometimes .
Sometimes abuse the right to be a journalist with all sorts of questions with no response or have a partial response to these famous people can say that journalists have a stressful job for some people .
And finally I would like to say yes are against these people , or still might change their style and everything would be ok !

hello Pierre ,
I would like to thank you for you help me .
You send me a lot of information , but the most important was about the culture .
My teacher said that I have had a fantastic project .
Nowdays , the number of endangered species has increased .
Aactivist of animals rights claimed that the reason is the keeping animals in zoo .
But lot of peoples saying that , the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers .
So what should we do with that problem ?
To sum up , there are lot of cleary strong arguments for against keeping animals in zoo .
In my opinion people should bulid some kind of wildlife parks . This solution will allow
It 's really expensive sollution , but we must do that for
our next generations .
My town is called Assuit . the People here , have no knowledge about how to use their rubbish.people throw their rubbish everywhere . on the other hand , we haven't any kind of law , that can limit that action ; I mean rubbish throwing .
So if we still doing nothing new , out country will still unattractive .
Humans prefer luxurious life .
With the coming of cars , people are using public transport rarely .
Everyone prefer to have his / her own car.so the future of public transport is very dark .
This is an alarming issue that needs to be addressed at earliest .
Because if everyone uses his / her car pollution will increase and that will eventually affect every living being .
There we can eat a lot types of dishes but the most popular dishes are " costela " and " bacalhau na brasa " .
The restaurant is very well situated with a big parking and a beautiful landscape .
As your enter the place you are welcomed by magnificent setting , a lot of photographs of restaurant 's story and you have a wonderful view of the kitchen where you can see the chefs working so you can see the quality of the food .
The chefs take great care in selection the best quality ingredients and the service is great .
The clients do n't have to wait a long time until the dish is done while clients are waiting they always give bread and wine
The price of the food is expensive but nothing pays a good meal .
In the end of the meal you have to sign a book to recall in the future .

Why I enjoy my favouite sport ?
So I think my favorite sport is go walking through the nature .
I love it , when the temperatur is a little bit cold , but not too much .
I can relaxing , when i walk alone and hear the noise of the birds in the trees .
I live in a little village near a forest , so I can go everyday walking through it .
There are so much animals and when you are quite , you can see a deer or a fox .
And sometimes I take my camera with me , because I love photography and there are so much great motifs .
Rest ... aurant .
We all agree on that , eating food is one of the best moments on our day , it 's like word stops for a few minutes in which you are just enjoying your food .
But there 's a differenc between eating a good meal , and eating by the way .
In this opportunity i 'm going to talk about different cool restaurants we could choose at the moment of going out as the close of classes .
Michael decided to open the door and back for her , he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again , he like her , he knows himself and he wants to know her , he have kept all his feelings for a long time .
Which was the reason ?
The reason is the next , three days ago , he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told , I had one , come on you know my ex - girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing .
it was strange for Michael .
He remembered , two years ago when he had been working and he decided to back home early while he had been backing to home he saw his girlfriend with other guy they were hugging .
he arrived the home and he only thought and thought all night it was the second time that she has been unfaithful since then he is alone .
Today in the morning he have not gone to work and he was staying in a pub to drink beer , then a girl went to him , he knew her , she is Abigail .
This girl is an acquantance him .
They were talking about their lives and he remembered like he knew her on the bus , maybe she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit .
Finally Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first , I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine .
I can not eat anything even in New Year 's Eve and I was so tired that I can not play poker with my cousins .
Though everythings were depressing , I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family : we went to Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom.(I do n't know its variety~Is it from Japan??XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people .

There are some images for my family on the wall .
There is a coffee table made of wood with a clear glass .
Also on the sofas there are many colorful Pillows
There is a bookcase next to the rocking chair and when I have a free time I sitting on it and reading a book .
There are three sofas around a coffee table and it is so comfortable .
When I want studying for exams going to the living room and sitting front of TV
In addition , there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters .
There is a small gray carpet under the coffee table and it protects the things from breakage .
For this reason I spend most of my time there
It is very common that the bad economy of some countries force their people to emigrate to another country .
When this phenomenon occur most of the migrants need to learn the new language to adapt to the new environment .
As a consequence , they forgot their first language .
Another important point is the necessity of approval by some some indigenous groups or people that emigrate from the countryside to the city in order to get a better lifestyle .
It is not a surprise that this situation is something more frequent every day .
Public transport will be worse in the future than travelling by car because it is uncomfortable and slowly .
In Spain many people will travel in their car or by car with their colleague or friends , this transport is quick , but it is much more expensive .
If you travel with other people it is the same expens than public transport .
In my opinion sharing a car we will arrive at work on time and when we will finish work we can go directly home .
The apartments in the cities are much more expensive and the people prefer to travel in their car .
People who needs to go in the same direction , meet each other and use only one car .
This is convenient for the cost of travelling , because every cost is divided for the participants and is an experience to meet other people .
My country very interesting place , we have more ancient and mistyc places .
You can travelling to Samarkand , Bukhara , Khiva and another historical citys .
Our national foods are very delicious .
I think , you could nt work in my country , because its illegal for foreiners .
Thanks for you letter .
We meet near fast food and after that we decide where to go .
In the centre city we can go to other shopping center such as : " Passage",Europe","Scorpion".Last weekends we visited Passage .
In this shopping center I bought new blue skirt .
After that we went our favorite art - cafe .
We like it because cafe has beautiful design and tasty food .After that we went to walk on embankment .
Hope to hear from you soon !
All the best .
First of all , thank you professor to teach in the meantime , the entire course of the learn really benefited , especially in the first meeting , for British English , I still did not really understand , it makes me frustrated , but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English , I think it 's all because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's easy to learn , and you really very carefully and very humorous , you 're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student , using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really hard to study , all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opportunity to contact British English , it 's full of tone cadence , always feel particularly charming , and British culture exudes noble temperament , so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities .
And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental , I think it 's maybe the learning habit , when I heard a sentences , I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again , therefore , I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missed a few notes , such as -d , I did not noticed this because when I deliberately stressed -d , I found the tone and mood more likely to become very weird , this is the biggest problem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm not teaching English in my new school , but in the future if there is the chance I will definitely give it a try , especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , the biggest gain this course is to read picture books to read and record , because that and English proficiency is not just training , but will note that strengthen their pronunciation and intonation , and then each time peer feedback also completed the listening exercises .
If I have an opportunity to back on English teaching , I think I will try this skill to get my students to do the recordings heard training , then make their English better and better .
It is situated on the inland .
The first stop for most visitors is the church because the neighbors clean and cared .
The town hall put in the streets containers for trash and the workers of tomw hall clean the streets .
Besides this , everybody cleans their doors to keep it tidies up .
What 's more , all people once a year , plant trees in all village for it is more beautiful .
To begin with , nowadays more and more people prefer trevelling by car rather than by bus or train .
Certainly , it is more comfortable to travel by your own transport with your family or your friends . You can stop and have a rest wherever you want .
You can change your plans and choose another direction .
For differentiate between old computers and computers today , would first have to describe each type of machine .
I start describing old computers which we saw in the video were few simple machines ( at the time they were created ) and covering an enormous room .
On top of that these machines only worked when it is wrote an order to the computer .
These were experiential models .
Visually colors ranging on the screen were the black and green .
Currently in the 21st century , computers have had a very long technology advance which range from the software and the size internal memory ( bigger than the old computers ) , the size of the computer ( which is varied but more smaller than the previously computers ) and its shape , the weight of it ( they are more lightweight ) and variations in the colors of the screen ( visually ) .
Finalize can tell that with the passage of time people we change the way we see the world , comes into play evolution , not only of technology but also of society , religion , etc .
essential in the life of people , but sow will be factors that humans will not be able to modify and it is better to continue as they are .
Sometimes famous people want to be alone without any journalist .
In my opinion , staying alone means that you have something to think about , for example to think about our deeds .
Journalists follow you and they do n't give you to live such as normal pupil .
To be on my own and watch the other people live .
I always wear a mask , I can be myself only with my close people .
In the end , I want to tell you that we are not robots , everyone deservs that they want .
My opinion it 's opposite of them of this composition .
I did n't have a car .
Every day I used to taking public transport .
I live in a city , and for many people live like me , the most convenient transport is the public transport .
there is a heavy traffic , and the difficulty in finding a parking place .
Every day , the population spends a lot of time in the traffic congestion .
It 's a very good method to travel in the city .
A car problem is the expensive price of the fuel .
I like public transport and I love my planet . I think the best method for reduce the polucion .
It 's used to public transport .
but it 's only my personal opinion .

Have you ever have this experience ?
When I am in elementary school , I joined a speaking contest , but I failed , and I had broken - hearted .
But soon I made up my mind , thinking that I ca n't be so decadent forever I want some change , hoping I will be better in the next year .
No matter it is sun or rain , wind or warm . And also asked teacher for help .
Eventually , I got number three in the comtest .
Through this time , I learn that win and lose is not the most significant thing .
The most important is that you can learn a valueabe lesson from failure .
Resolve/ dertermine / insistence
My country witnessed a tremendous change in the last ten years .
10 years ago , I was a child , and I can seldom eat meat in dinner .
But now , I feel uncomfortable without food everyday .
Nowadays young people 's health is n't as healthy as for example twenty years ago .
One reason for the change may be due to the style of life that people have .
Currently we do usually less exercise than before because we use our car to go anywhere .
Whereas our style of food has changed very much .
We do n't eat at home and it 's very common eating junk food every week .
On the other hand , children are used to eat only what they want because in general they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruits , fish ...
They like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sweets and what 's more they do n't do any exercise .
All these reasons could be very bad for their health in the future .
So it 's very important to give them a healthy education .
To sum up , it is very important to be conscious about how food affect our health .
That 's the reason for we have to do more exercise , eat less fat and more vegetables and teach our children to eat better and healthier than they are used to do .
My opinion ofselfemployment
I never ever wanted to be selfemployed .
My dad and my grandfather had run their own business for more than 20 years .
My mother always told me that my dad had never time for her and my siblings .
When I was born my dad decided to quit his company to get more time for his family .
Nowadays , the car owners have been increasing in many countries , especially in developed countries , due to the convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some people claim that the social trend tends to decline the popularity of travelling by public transport .
Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society .
so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem .....
now traffic problem is the biggest problem . only solution to this use of public transport system as much as possible .
but now using public transport is looked as person of low status , so there is no future for public transport .
to tackle this problem we have to deliberately think about it .
thank you very much
Our life is keep changing everyday and we notice that huge range of the changing in each decades .
The lifestyle , technological material and the design of cars and houses keep changing annually .
We can admit that our life will be quite different from now to the fifty years later .
Changing is a natural habitat that makes the life more enjoyable to us .
It 's bringing the happiness to and the beauty to us .
For example , we can know the type of a car model by the changes that are made on it which it makes you idiotif the small new details in every model .
Even the kind of house panting can be changed by the time .
Now it is more colorful and designed in different ways Than it was at the past time .
We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable .
Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction .
It is bring the hope to their live and makes them taste the life in way that they had dreamed about it .
In conclusion , the changing of our life can help us to explore different benefits for the changing every decade .
It service the education and entertainment aspects in our life .
The ecological problems are very important for the last years .
An enormous quantity of cars and the traffic jams provokes a pollution of air and smog .
The urban authorities can not change the situation cardinally .
But there is an active construction of new roads , road junctions and an improving of roads .
But people are interested in it and this year I saw announcements about days of receiving of separate rubbish .
Our lawns also are the problem .
But the last time the street - cleaners mow all the young grass .
I enjoy watching Tennis in my couch , is weird that I haven't played Tennis because where I live we do n't have that kind of sport , so I just can watch in my TV .
But I hope one day go to a tournament , travel to Spain and watch my favourite player who is Rafael Nadal from Spain .
Since the first time I watched him play , eight years ago was the same year that I started watch Tennis .
I like how the players moved through the court and how the audience applaused them every time they won a point , although I 'm not in the court I could feel the feeling of the game , it 's really awesome .
Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament , besides I watched and enjoyed it , also could learn how real the game was , which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no - reason , all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players , is one of the things that I want to make real .
My advice would be that I you want to play Tennis just go ahead play it , not expect till others do it , because you can do that too .
At the beginning it could be a little harsh , but is the same with many others sports when they start , so just keep in mind that you can play Tennis with the most talented players from the world overall .
Btu , What about sharing a ride ?
Riding a horse is and old faschion way but still interesting .
Público transportation is excellent , you sabe money , tale care of the environment and make friemds .
Nowadays , Easter is associated more with the spring 's arrival than religious rituals .
People are more likely to take care of the gardening or shopping than participate in the celebration of Good Friday which makes the author connect Easter with a pagan spring festival .
Flamengo was champion on 2009.In 2009 Flamengo has a great team with good players , but now it fight to finish the competition among the first 4 teams of championship .
My mouth is dry and have an awful metal taste , head aches , still slightly spinning and there is a terrible ringing in my ears .
It must have been the aftereffect of whatever that clowns in masks have done to me . I want to shut down all the noises around , especially those whisper shouts coming from behind .
My best friend had always been like a sister to me .
Our mums had been to high school together , although they 'd never talked a lot .
The first time I met her , she insulted me , but I just did n't pay attention in what she had told me .
It was in school , when we were three years old only !
Even that , we start to talk more and more , until we were what we are nowadays .
She always helps me in whatever I need , and she 's amazing .
She 's always happy and laughing , and never gets angry when I get nervous !
She 's incredible , is like the sister I 'd never had .
In the other hand , she had never been a talktive girl , so it 's usually me who is always talking a lot .
Even so , now she starts to talk more often , and when we started high school we met lots of new friends !
I would n't imagine a life without her , she 's the best person I ever met .
My town was located along the middle coast of Viet Nam .
It is a really beautiful place and has a lot of scenery , such as the great beach besides a row tree , the obviously regularly weather ... Therefore taking care of the environment there is a vitally important mission of my town 's state .
When having an alarm about the pollution water , land ... by town 's civil , authorities must reposibile for this cause .
They often notify all the town 's civil that spending a free day on clearing all rubbish on the beach and on the roads of town .
Then , they will gather all rubbish to one place and burn or bury them .
Finally , state usually encourage on the radio , television etc .
It means that tourists and the people of town must have a crucial duty to protect the beach , the roads etc .
On weekends , I usually wear clothes depending on the weather .
If it is too cold outside , I put a jacket on , but if it is too hot I wear shorts , sandals , a light weight vest and sunglasses .
Sometimes , when I got to dress well , I wear dressy stuff , such as skirts , dresses , high heels and a sort of classy hairstyle .
When I stay at home , I can wear pyjamas all day long ( for example when I 'm sick ) Also , there are days when I want to go to the beach with my family , and so I put my bikini and a summer dress on .
In your message , you said that you need to find a famous people in my country and need some suggestions from me .
I would like to recommend that a famous people who names Mr. Chou .
Mr. Chou is the famous doctor in my country .
He constructed the hospital system in my country .
Best regard , and look forward to your reply .
In modern life , we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere .
It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it , so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport .
I could n't agree with the point of view for some reasons below .
Firstly , the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam .
That wastes people 's time and make people feel exhausted .
Not mention to say , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays .
Secondly , private cars are the main reason for the air pollution . We should consider the protection of environment for human future , not only care about the convenience we can see for now .
In the other hand , public transport system can reduce the amount of private cars in the busy area , like bus and tram .
For instance Melbourn , the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area .
Therefore people do n't need to drive cars for travelling in the city .
The last point is people go for long journey by public transport .
Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive .
For these reasons , it is unlikly there is no future for public transport .
On the contrary , We need more public traffice to improve our traffic system and find the better way to maintain the environment .
Alison read the note and it say 's " i 'll be back at 8 pm " .
It was 11 pm and her boyfriend was n't in their house , she started getting confused and temerously .
After waiting for 20 minutes , she decided to call the police ; they said " wait for the morning , maybe he went somewhere , now we ca n't help you " .
After that answer , she was n't satisfied so she decided to start calling all the hospitals of the area .
it was 4 am and she had none answer .
Alison felt desesparate , she notice that her husband 's car were in her house , so he was walking or someone pick up to him , she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends , nobody now anything and now they were scaried .
She was terrified , she starts thinking about the possibility of the death .
She got into her car and look for her husband for all their small city , Pentonville , after half an hour she saw him sleeping in a square .
George had lost her memory , and he could n't went back .
Nowadays , they are living a happy life and everyday Alison has to make him remember their life .
No future for public transport , it is one of problem if that fact .
now days , there are many type of transport in the world , bus taxi , train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city .
if you to travel from city to city , public transport is cheaper than others .
my favorite sport is playing footboll .
I think that this sport is very happy .
In my opinión , if you want to start to do this sport you could write a team . moreover , I think that it is good because you could help to lose wight .
The statement " public transport is our future " has been an interesting political discuss during years .
On one hand the public transport is good because it does n't pollute so much and you can muve around all the city .
We do n't use so much petroll like if we each of the passenger to use it own private transport .
In fact you ca n't use it if you have to carry a lot of things or when you have hurry .
In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem , is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages .
Transportation is very important in cities , villages as well as in sub - lines .
Many people has no vehicles , they only depends on public transport due to some reasons .
Any way in some cases , car is very useful to reach the destination very fast .
Public transport provide all the information about routes of the way which we are follow and give a idea to the passengers about the place .
Some times it may be very expensive due their taxes

First I would like to intoduce myself , my name is Joaquín Gutiérrez and I tell you why my favourite sport is football which is a sport than I have practiced since I was six years old .
I like very much this sport because it must be play with a gruop of people and is funnier than others sports which you play alone with other opponent , like tennis .
I have confessed that in the first time I did n't like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more .
Actually I play in the first divission of the club River PLate from Argentina .

Do you hear about Islam
What are your sources media or what ?
Can you ask yourself why we are here on earth to entertain or for what ?
Be honest with yourself
At first I would like to tell you that I do not agree with this statement . I could even tell that this opinion is opposite of the present and future situation .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so much more convenient , most people will always travel by a train , railway , bus and other types of public transport .
In my opinion people will travel by public transport more frenquely , because this type of transport is less expensive , more trustworthy and even more ecological than travelling by car .
In the other hand , we can say that it is really uncomfortable to travel by public transport , but even this we can improve in future .
We can discover new ways of travelling , take more care of our public transport and modernise them , so people would be motivated to travel by .
My trust in futuric technology is so enormous that I hope there are going to be a new ecological and cheaper ways to travelling around our world .
If this will happen , people are going to be more social and empatic , not even for peoples emotions , but also for our environment and they will treasure it .
To begin with , there are two ways of cutting down on pollution . which leads to global warming , that became a real threat of our life day by day .
to illustrate , when we use the renewable energy we reduce emissions so , our natural resources will be conserved for our future furthermore sons future .
for example , using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions .
Secondly , we should improve our regulations that rules impose people lowering using things make a lot of pollution illustrate , using big vehicles or about building big facilities such as big factories .
As a result , ways to cut down on pollution . for instance , when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same that make a lot of pollution for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future .
Another thing we can do to a better future is avoiding war .
Because , war destroys mankind and countries .
Many wars start because , people do n't know or respect the other beliefs very well thus , we need to learn about belief other people we are live with them .
for example , the fight between Muslim and Hindus in India or in Lebanese civil war .
Secondly , do more cooperation between countries .
To illustrate , people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing .
For example , United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . in brief , knowing each other and do more cooperation between countries it is to ways to avoid war for a better future .
for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future .
My most terrifying day was January 23rd , last year .
I was at school : while I 'm listening to the English lesson I felt a strong headache .
After ten minutes I asked the teacher of called my parents for returned home .
At home , my dad and I had lunch , but my headache did n't finish .
At 2 p.m. my mum decided to go to the hospital because I ca n't undestood nothing and I ca n't talked .
On the hospital the doctor did me a drip and after some hours I felt better .
I do n't ever forget that day !
currently a very significant problem for its social and economic impact is the chaotic public transport in Lima .
To solve this problem Lima has been making long term strategies .
Lima is one of the cities with less road culture in the world .
we do not respect traffic rules to drive only with the intention to go fast as possible to our destination , this often causes traffict accidente and congestion .
For this reason people is becoming acure of the terrible problem and is learning and teaching vial culture to new generations .
Besides public institucions are promoting this and also private companies make advertising for awereness .
Lima is among the top ten cities have the messiest public transport in the world .
This is due to Lima in the beginning has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways , and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population .
Currently this issue is so important that governments are investing and working to create solutions such a metropolitan .
I think we have really become aware of the chaos of public transport and we have begun to design and implement strategies that in 20 years our reality improve our reality
In my opinion I believe the public transport will have future , because this transport is very necessary for the people .
In all cities of the world , the people will need the public transport to move around the city .
The people think that the public transport is only the bus , but the public transport is the bus , the taxis , train and subway .
Maybe travelling by car is so much more convenient , but there are a lot of cars and this car produce a lot of smoke and the nature is dying , if we do nothing , the nature will disappear .
I would like the people to take the public transport for travelling , so we will be able rescue the countryside .
I usually take the public transport for going to the University , because the public trasnport is cheaper than the car .
I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money
With respect to the international dispute over the Diaoyutai Islands , the Republic of China should consistently express willingness to resolve the issue on a peaceful manner in line with the principles of the UN Chart and international law .
To this end , it has proposed the East China Sea Peace Initiative in 2013 called upon all parties concerned to the steps outlined below :
( 5 ) establish a mechanism in collaboratedly exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea .
He imagined he could fly like adragon .
As he pumped down the stairs , wings flapping cross Cairo .
He flied to Saudi Arabia .
Eventually he saw the Kabaa .
As he got closer , he saw alot of people around tha Kabaa .
They was doing rites of pilgrimage .
One there , a man raised his hands and called to the God .
It 's amazing .
He had never seen anything so fantastic , but all too soon , it was time to leave .
It had been fun day out but unfortunately he had to be home in the time for bed .
After he had arrived to home , he fell asleep and he started to think of his next adventure ..........
My neighbourhood is a very pleasant area , it is big enough and it is so green .
The populations estimated around ten thousand person .
My neighbourhood surround by the large sequences of mountains which they have scenery view .
We got a large shopping centre with some local shop , you can obtain plenty of things that you want from it .

All amenities that is necessary for your daily life such as fantastic school with perfect teachers and modern building is found .
Transportation does not make a matter because it has got many bus lanes and bus stations .
It is not quiet and it is active city in a different ways .
If you like active city with enormous activity , I guess it is excellent place .
My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day . I like it becasue it is the best way to loss weight and get your health better than medicine .
I think someone should get exercise by starting play some favourite sport instead of watching TV or playing game .
The purpose of this propossal is to provide details abouts shopping facilities in my hometown , Vung Tau , and give some recommendations for tourists .
They had a long tradition dating back to the 18 century when Vungtau was a a small commercial port .
Not only are they well - known for its long tradition but it also famous for the hospitality of inhabitants living here which attract domestics and foreign tourists come here to see the famous sights as well as shopping for souvenirs .
They are closely located the local art gallery which take about 15 minutes to go by foot .
They offer a wide range of choice from souvenir items such as pictures , jewellries to local specialities with a reasonble price to suit different interests of people .
You can buy them as a small present to your family members or friends .
I assure that high - quality and various products there should be satisying your needs .
It is conveniently situated in the town centre which takes 5 minutes to walk in a crow flies .
A lot of products such as consumer electronics , foods , souvenirs are sold here .
Compared with local shops , products ' price in shoping mall is considerably higher than that in local shops but it offers more varieties of products .
I highly recommend local shops to our tuorists for its cheap price and the hospitable manners of residents here .
good morning firstonce .
My name is Yusuf Hamid I am 17 years old and I visit the state secondary school in Scheßlitz ,
tob e more precise , I am in the graduating class .
I come from Hallstadt , in close vicinity of Bamberg .
My hobbies are meet Friends and hangout with them or play baskteball in my spare time .
I 'm easily excited and nervous because this oral examination will determine wether i can do my A -level on the college of further education in Bamberg what i really want .
My favourite sport is play soccer .
It 's played by eleven players who try to score a goal during ninety minutes .
There is a grass floor , but it 's also played on artificial grass .
I really enjoy playing it because it 's very exciting because everything could happens .
I usually playing it with my partners and my friends which do the game even more fun .
I hardly recommend whoever to play soccer , because i 'm sure that they 're going to enjoy it very much .
It 's also a full sport because people will improve their health condition .
First I want to say is that people use the car like luxury objet , not as transport machine .
People spend their first salary to buy a car .
So , normally the use of the car is for pleasure .
Peolple do n't use the five seats of the car to go to travel .
From the point of view of the invaironment this is a bad idea because spend a lot of gas by person .
The cities are crowded and there are a lot of pollution with noises and smoke .
A new problem is being in the small cities , because they are not disigned to harbor a lot of cars .
I think that the main problem of the piblic transport is the infrastructure between villages and small cities , because they only exit between the great cities .
Some countries have a good net of intrastruture and people use then mainly , because the public transport is cheaper than the car and more quickly .
It is a problem of mentality , if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally .
In my own town , people do n't use public transport , some months ago the council gave a public sercice bike and three months later they had to close it .
My name is Afsaneh , I'm from IRAN , I came to London 4 months ago and I want to talk about Iranian celebration of new year .

In during the holiday people going to see their family , friends and relatives in type of short time visit .

The television can entertain , and also educate the people .
Have so many educacionals programs , like Animal Planet , and so many others .
Sometimes , some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class , for example , Animal Plante can help you in biology , The History can help in history , etc ... In my opinion the television can be good as books , and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books , because TV is something fun , so you can learn and have fun at the same time .
Series also can help you to study , for me it helped me a lot because I love series and some q I watch helped me in school , such as breaking bad , which helped me in chemistry , and so many others .
last year I saw a movie called ' ' side by side '' , and talked a little of life in old history , and coincidence I was having this matter in school , then it helped me a lot .
in my opinion the television can entertain as can educate people on different ways .

Everyone says that our lifes are going to change in the future but that is what everyone says .
In the future I really want my grandchildren to be happy that is all I ask for . I may be young but I think I do n't see myself living on earth in the next 50 years i mean dream does not hurt .
I question myself everyday how can i survive in this madness world ?
I do not know how to answer this question honestly but i guess i will never know .
I think that public transport has a great future because every time there are more people who use it .
However , I think it is very expensive but with a decrease in the cost there would be more people .
Nowadays have a car is very expensive because you have to pay a lot of thinks .
Public transport would have more future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use more public transport but I hardly ever use private transport
Baja California is bigger than Aguascalientes for the beaches and tourist cities .
The transportation is practical because not all places are search , use more the car , truck and sometimes boat .
The tourist will never be able bored and will have much time to visit the city .
Baja California weather is not as cold as Chihuahua .
When you go to the beach you have across a large avenue to get there walking .
I 'm very tiring day , when I go and went straight to bed .
The last few days that I was in Baja California I 've got very little time for shopping and go to the beach .
Well I think you have chosen the best idea , because there are
First I believe you can travel from north of Italy to the south , in
Find a job in Italy is n't as easy as you think , because the
economic system is in crisis , so it 's hard just for Italian , thinking for
But it 's not all , since you know two languages , maybe you can find
a summer work in a travel agency , because they need someone to
reception who can speak another language over Italian .
I will find out someone who know the agency 's manager , and you will
have sent me your curriculum after the weekend , because he will surely want it .
I 'm very glad to read you again ,
I think the car is more convenient for public transport .
In the car you do not have a timetable to be respected , you 're free to leave , to go home when you want ... not sit still to snow , rain , cold .
And without getting stuck in a city for delays for drivers . on public transport there is the possibility that you 're standing on the whole trip , there is always a lot of people , is cold in the winter and in the summer it 's too hot .
trips are longer on public transport or by car .
although I do not know if this would always choose the machine .
By reading the history , we can know that some disasters happened every the year of Jaiwu .
There happened several serious natural or man - made disasters in this year .
In Taiwan , a serious air crash caused by the bad weather happened first .
A storm of food problems broke out next .
In the global , up to three air crashes which result from being hijacked or shot happened .
There were also conflicts between western countries and the ISIS .
In my opinions , all of us are supposed to be careful about all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , all human beings should stop fighting and devote ourselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Last but not least , we should do everything with our conscience .
Frankly it seems that the town that I have been living have not taken care about the environment .
It is easy to see when we walking around or when we go to some walk .
In general we do n't take care about nothing , water , recyclable things even our air conditioning .
This is such a chronic problem in all my country .
Here in Brazil is very difficult take care about it because it demands serious behaviour and skills from our gorvernants which unfortunatuly wo n't happens in a short time .
Although Brazil passed through several changes since last 40 years , the main one haven't started yet and I am talking about Education .
Our government prefer keep our population without information , because it is easier to manipulate their mind .
And why am I talk about it ? I am talk about it because the foundation of environment care is our minset , just with knowledge and information we will be able to manage actions to save , protect and improve the environment , and reverse we have the current result .
So if we believe it is a kind of important subject to take care , we need to move fast and our first step should be our election process .
this aphirism is famous and truth .
People try to build big and laxuries house but they forgot about the main .
it is warm which is needful for us .
we can have really good house where are many furniture , space and ornaments .
we can choice expencive things for interior .
but these things are not important if there is not comfortable atmosphere .
we have to invest our love , dreams , patient . and as a result we can create the best house ever .
building our house we make the most important place for us .
so we have to follow our dreams and create a warm and cosy place
In this report I am going to talk about how in my town take care of the environment .
First at all , I ask the council for this great problem which is the pollution and the way to solve it .
He is aware that the growth of the pollution is a big problem and that must be taken mesuares for trying to solve it .
It is not easy way but it is necessary to do it .
n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care the environment
On the other hand , the ask is if this solution could be enough or no .
In my opinion we should take conciencious and stop it , if we don , t stop it , after it will be later .
I love my family , we argue hardly ever !
For example : we go to the restaurant , we go to see my brother 's football match , we eat or stay at home all together .
We sometimes do presents at the party like the Birthday ...
The best present that I receive was ... I do n't remebmer !
Another thing , at my home there are some rules : I and my brother tidy our room , we clean the bathroom when we use it , we ca n't eat in the sofà ..
I always try to follow rules but I sometimes break them because I 'm lazy !
I do n't argue with only one of my family .. I sometimes argue with my brother for television channels but we make up immediately .
With my parents I argue about school , how I use my mobile phone , how I speak with them ..
My last argue with my family was yesterday
I 'll talk about Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia , Riyadh City specialty .
First , you should know is the weather , we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east .
Riyadh is the capital City it 's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities .
after what I told you about my country I hope you like it .
My village has around 700 residents
It has a lot of beautiful things how an old church of century XV but this church is in ruins but the new church also is very beautiful and comfortable .
My village has a wall of the stone , this wall was built by resident of the village in 1715 .
Other interesting place in my village is the square with his source
Also there the same supermarket , bar and restaurants .
For many years , people use public transport to go to work to study and to travel .
So , we use trains , buses and bikes to transport from place to place .
let us discover the aventadges and disavandges the
I think that a public transport will have future by the many reasons .
Man could have some problems with his health .
For example , if man had broke a leg , it might be hard to drive a car .
Also , for somebody it could be cheaper to travel by a bus , especially for a tourist from a foreign country .
Sometimes are better to travel by the bus because of thorny road .
Bus is one of the democracy transport , which is used by the students , kids , adults , rich and poor people .
When you are travelling with a big company , it is a best decision to travel by the bus .
Because everyone has a place in the bus .
And it 's funny and exciting to travel with the group by the bus .
Nowadays , people has a stressfull live so we ca n't spend time waiting for public transport .
We can think that there is no future for public transport because most of people use their own car .
Using your own car you can take the decision of what timetable is more convenient and what way your are go to use .
It 's more confortable go anyway with your own car , the problem is the pollution that this life bring us , and also the park problem .
If everybody go with their own car , their have to park and maybe the place is full .
Also , travelling by car is so much more convenient because you do n't have to go stopping in each town , so using your own town saves time .
Nowadays , people are really worried for their jobs due to the big financial crisis in which some people are lost their jobs and other are working in rubbish jobs for little money .
For all this , the question is too difficult to answer .
In my opinion , the most important is enjoy your work because we spent an average of nine hours in the office or in whatever work that we will do , as a result if you do n't feel comfortable , your life could be a hell .
The truth is , that the perfection would be that all people could work in their dream jobs and of course , making a lot of money , like for example Hollywood actors or football players but this is almost impossible .
In summary , for me , it is better enjoy at work every day , although you have not a big salary .
The most important is wake up each day with a big smile and work hard .
The scorch trials is one of the best films and thriller that I have ever seen , it is so exited all the thing that they do to survive in the outside world with all those people that are infected with a virus and the reason why they put them in the glade for them to be inmune if some sick person bite them .
one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them does n't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno , and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa ( i never like her ) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world .
it is a beautiful place where people can go to spend an excellent time and enjoy the forest and lagoons .
There are cabins where you can have a good time in front of the bonfire and sleep in a beautiful room made of ecological materials .
In the trip you can do many activities like climbing , swimming , paddling rafting and enjoying the place .
It is a beautiful place to go on your free time and get to know it .
I think I am the appropriate personn for this job because I have a lot of motivation and a good English level .
I would also like to get this job because I love the USA and I often do Babysitting so the company of children not afraid me .
When I was younger I went to summer camp in France , consequently I know which activities I can propose to children .
I hope I convince you .
This subject is beautiful and incredible . I like it very much .
I want to do this course everyday if it 's possible also now .
I want yours helps .
Can you help me somehow?Please I want to study this subject .
The day began as usual and no signs of trouble were but when she woke up and went down stairs she saw a dog but the dog was an unusual color .
Usually her dog had a blue color but at that moment it was Red
Recently , I have seen the Tarantino 's new film , Django Unchained , and I have to recognize that I am looking forward to watch the next one .
He took down every mistake he made last films .
Firstly , Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past , due to a great introduction without dialogues , where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm , it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino 's films .
Nowadays , In many country the youth looking for doing sports to be fitness and very active there are many sports to join it .
On the other hand , there are some arguments for sport specially volleyball .
When I play volleyball I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing but volleyball and the intensity of the game .this game i like to play .
In addition to this It pushes me to keep on trying so that I can get everything right .
It 's all about will power and the absolute want to get better .
On the one hand , there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries , The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone .
In addition to this , Injuries were more frequent during games than training .
In my opinion , Volleyball must then be considered among high - risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way .
I believe there are numerous possibilities on public transport because cars and public transport play completely different roles in our society .
First of all , public transport probably meets the demands of people who hardly or do n't use their cars to travel .
In Japan , which has one of the largest population over 60s , many senior people prefer to use buses to cars .
In addition , a new generation appear and they do n't own their cars because of a few opportunities to travel and high cost of having a car on their own .
Second , public transport provides a quick and easy way to visit unfamiliar places with us .
It is not necessary for us to know in advance how to get to the destination before the departure by using public transport .
So it prevents us to open maps to confirm every single route .
When it comes to our environment , the use of transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
Because of these reasons , I see a blight future for public transport .
it is out of the question the take care of the environment is regarded as turning point in our life .
it is upstearm that irrigates our economic life . and no doubt that Negligence has the ability to destroy many good sides in our life .and our government is doing her best to put end to negligence .
but we also must coparation to save our town . on the other hand we must Presentation awareness program for all people .
and we must throw rubbish in the street to keep the area clean and we must Maintain clean trees to keep the area attractive thus we can improve National income by attracting many people from other town . and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . to top it all we ca n't go without Cleanliness of our town .
Natural environment destroyed that is a people focus on frequently problem .
Many countries build more and more buildings affect people quality of life .
Setting up more large building can destroyed people and animals live environment and some animals maybecan extinction .
Governments should do some measures to deal with build more buildings will destroy the ecological environment .
There is no future for public transport , becasue travelling by car is so much more convenient .
I 'm not agree abaout this statement becasue in a big cities there are a lot of cars , if all people in a city use his own car at the same time , there will be a huge traffic , so travelling by car is n't much more convenient in this situation .
There are more problems in big cities , one of them is parking , there are a lot of areas in a city that is very difficult to park , and you only have 2 options , you can park in a private parking and pay a lot of money or you can waste you time searching for a place of parking .
I want to talk about my favourite sport game .
Have you ever heard about hockey ?
This is really my favourite sport game .

And I am glad to win a cup of championship .
I am waiting for a final of this game .
I want to give advice for children .
Do n't be afraid of hockey!You used to sit in front of computer , but the best choice will get up and go to the hockeyclub .

Your sincerely ,
I am was asking to me if you want to go to the party with me ?
what you think ?
the party is the next week on Julias house , it is going to start at 5:00 pm
I engaged in swimming in nine years old .
I had gotten first prize in a match .
As a result , I think that I have some intellent on swimming .
Since then , I meet my teacher in the pool .
She teach me a lot of things , and be the most important figure in my life .
She is a doctor , she told me that swimming will let my body more better .
From then on , I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax .
Consequently , I need to swim usually .
First of all , swim can help your health .
The research declined that swim can decrease disease .
When you in the water , you will feel relax .
Third , swim can get more friend .
You can go to the swimming club , that is a way to meet people with interesting of same .
You can try this sport from now on .
Many people think running is a wasting time or it 's very difficult but I do n't agree .
Firstly , you will be stronger , enduring .
Now my average jogging is 8 - 10 kilometers and going on 40 - 50 minutes .
My best result is 15 km , but I guess awhile .
I am less having a cold .
After that on the next day , I feel myself better .
Four years ago I had often cold and recovery long period .
Now I have more energy and health to become happier .
Cause of this was hurt my leg .
After rehabilitation I continued feel hurt in my foot and I still limped .
I decided to stop this and one gorgeous morning I starting running !
As result , I know the men can be harder than can be seem .
After these moments , you starting doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable .
I advise start from one km .
Two - three jogging in a week is norm for beginners .
3 ) Grow up .
First week one km , second one km and 300 meters etc .
4 ) Think about your initial physical conditions .
I found ad about this job on the Internet
I would like to start working in your cafe , because it is very interested in the kitchen and everything connected with it .
I have experience in working in a cafe .
My advantage is that I am very open and friendly .
My last job is working as dealer in a lot of shops .
I think I am good at dealing with people , particularly in the food .
I traveled a lot , because this is my hobby , I learned about a lot of food in many countries
I used to work full - time jog .
I am prepare for long working hours , that 's no problem for me , because I am young and I like working and spend timee with people .
I look forward for new challenges and tasks .
I expect a positive response .
do you have any plan on next Sunday ?
We want to go for a picnic to the park near my house at 12:00.My husband invited you for that .
Do you fancy for coming ?
If you come let me know do you like meat ?
Is Physical Education necessary at schools ?
First of all , It is true that not all the people like do sports because they are heavy and a bit stressful too .
We can also say that there are other subjects more important than Physical Education , like Biology or History .
However , Physical Education is necessary because makes people less lazy .
Despite the fact that sports are heavies , doctors are always saying that sports improves our health .
Schools have Physical Educations for teach this good habit since our childhood .
In conclusion , Physical Education are necessary at schools because sports improve our health and make us feel good and healthy .
I would like to make a reservation for the next month , from 24th may till 28th ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I have doubts about booking policy .
I mean , after reading the terms and deposit policy , I understand I must pay the first night at the booking time and the rest of the stay it would be paid upon arrival to the front desk .
Plus , in case I cancelled the reservation 48 hrs before arrival it would charged the 5% of the full stay .
I understand this part , but in case I have to cancel the reservation , how should I do it ?
To begin with I would like to say that doing a sport is very important to keep us thin and healthy .
My favourite sport is swimming because it is the one I have been practising for a long time ago since I was a kid .
I like swimming because it is a sport that makes me work all my body and it is also a really complete sport .
Nowadays it is really important to know how to swim because when we are in holidays we spend most of our time in the water at the swimming pool or even at the sea .
I like other sports such as football and volleyball too .
I would give the advice that this sport makes people healthy but it also help us to make new friends because while we are training we have mates in our team which we can talk to and make them our friends .
Otherwise it is a sport where you do not have contact with your friends what helps not to make injuries .
To conclude , I think this is a really good sport to start with when we are a little child to gain experience and year after year becoming better and improving .
No wonder if we say that sport is so important .
Actually there are two kinds of sports .
First one is individual sports and in this kind you practice your game alone and you are the only player on your team .
Second kind is team sports .
In this kind , you are one of the team and all the team play as a one person .
A lthough some people prefer individuIal games , but I prefer team games .
Because it teach as the meaning of cooperation and leadership .
I play football every day with my friends at club .
I found football interesting because it teach us a lot of morals such as cooperation and onest .
I also can get fun with my friends when I play it .
I think it is the most interesting sport
Famous people definitely deserved to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
I think everyone should have their private lives .
In our world lives many personalities , more or less known , such a film - stars , music - stars and so on , but why they ca n't have normal lives ?
They also have families , they also sleeps , have friends , and that 's normal . We can look at them like aliens .
Honestly , if I were in their shoes I would n't stand it .
I would feel like a prisoner , who ca n't do anything , because someone will make a photo of it , and I wo n't have peace .
Actually I have to admit , that , film stars , politicians and other famous people have to count on fame .
They must know , people will identifie them , walking through the street .
They ca n't complain , because it 's the way of life they choose .
In my opinion , everyone deserves for calmness .
With reference to your advertisement in the current issue of the summer camp job , I am writing to you to apply for it .
In the advertisement you state that you need a person who has skills for job with children .
I would like to tell you that I have done a course in which I have learnt to organise all kinds of activities with children since canoeing from swimming competitions , also , I worked in a summer camp last yaer where y could put all the things that I have learnt in practise and it was a very pleasant experience which I would like to do it again .
Because of that , if you want , I will send you a recommendation letter from my boss in that camp .
In addition to that , I am well organised at the kitchen and I can cook a lot of different dishes .
I look forward to heraing from you as soon as possible .
Yours sincerely .
Everything 's ok .
The concert was just flubbergasted .
What a pity , that you haven't been there .
If I knew about the thing before I would invite all my mates .
It really was amazing , I think , it was a breakthrough in my perception of music .
What 's more , I did n't have to pay for the ticket , because it was a volunteer work - closing the door after people that were coming out of the concert hall .
The good thing about it was the fact , that the band(actually I even do n't remember it 's name)was playing with so much passion , that no one probably even think about leaving the place .
There were many things that just stunned me in one moment , when the band started to play ...
In my opinion music like this should be diplayed more often in the radio and other mass media .
The bad thing about it is that the band is not popular , and not many people have ever heard about it .
Mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music , probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music .

Football is such a beauty sport because it is really a fun in a lot of many ways .
Football is my favourite sport and I think it is never going away in my life .
I play football for Waitakere college school first eleven as a deffender and I enjoy playing that position because it is easy for me to play .
I used to dream of playing for barcelona and because barcelona has good players I like I , for example Lionel Messi .
Because where I was born there was n't any chance for me to practise football so I can become really good like other players .
But even though I will never get a chance of playing for my dream team I still enjoy playing football . I can play with people who are good and I still have fun .
I advise young kids to train hard and play football because there 's a lot of fun .
Once you start playing football , on a young age you get really better at football .
The last hotel I went was one the best one of my holidays .
" The heaven " , this was its name , was a nice small hotel near the seaside in the south of Italy , near Paestum exactly .
When we arrived there , last summer in July , the owners welcame us with a magnificent basket of fresh fruits in the room and a variety of drinks in the fridge all included in the room 's fee .
Any room in the hotel has a balcony which overlooks on the sea so every morning , when you wake up , you hear the sound of the waves breaking on the beach .
During our stay all the staff was friendly and always available .
Even if all meals were delicious and plentiful , you could also drink or eat special snacks while you were on the sunny beach .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone because there you will completely relax and really it will seem to you I you were in heaven !
There is perhaps notthing more pleasant than when your favourite sport is as healthy as enjoyable .
I believe that many people would agree with me , as football is the most faurite sport in the world .
Since I was five I have enjoyed playing football with my friends in front of our block of flats .
The ball was object which provided us with lots of fun while we kicked to it and had friendly matches .
As time went by , football remains my favourite sport .
It still gives me great fun within incredible company of my friends and it keeps me fit as well .
The best time for football is a sunny day after recent rain when ground is nice and soft and air is fresh .
Football is great sport for everyone men , women , children , adults , even elderly people enjoy it .
As someone who has played this sport for ages , my advice to people starting this sport is : get right equipment , find friendly team , and enjoy the game .
I definitely recommend this sport to everyone who wants to keep fit , have fun amongst their friends , and live happy life .
How have you been , my friend .
it been a long time I never see you , and you always wanted to visit Taiwan , my beautiful country .
I heard about You want to have a trip in Taiwan , I lovely helped you when you came to Taipei .
Taiwan 's culture always talked about eat .
At any time of day or night , we could see people eating in all kinds of eating establishments , from restaurants to food stalls in the streets .
I would show you the restaurant where is my favorite choice .
We also could go hiking on the mountain or go swimming at the beach , so you would have a good time in my country , Taiwan
On the other hand , you wanted to look for a job , maybe you could have part - time job in the cram school .
Many children usually did n't know how to study Engilsh , and you could help them to get there .
If you have interest in my idea , I would help you to find one immediately .
your friend
The other team was profesional , they had won many competitions , they were really good but Tom and I knew that we could won .
Our competition was on Monday , we had one day left .
Winning , we knew it had a cost but one that we could achieve .
Tom was really tired and it was really weird because it was not a hard run , I knew it was because of the nerves .
After the run we continued with our daily routine .
I told tom I wanted to talk about our achievements before we went home .
He also thanked me and told me that if it was n't for me he would n't even think about playing tennis in a professional way .
I am a University student .
Two months ago I worked in a kinder garden .
I know how to look after kids I even have two little sisters and I take care of them .
I can also do different activities with kids for example : singing , running around the garden , planting trees , drawing , playing instruments , etc .
At school I learned how to cook different types of food and desserts .
I 'm the rigt person for the job because I 'm reliable and experienced .
Sport is an important for all of us because it helps us avoiding disease , and becoming healthier .My favuorit sport is swimming .So practising this kind of sport is the best because it helps me feeling fresh and relax .
Moreover , daily excrsise is very good idea which helps us to avoid overweight and to keep your body healthier .So I always want to advise people to practise this sport or other kind of sports to avoid diseases .
During the last months , we could see a huge number of new movies issued by many famous European and American majors .
The two I have enjoyed the most are " The wolf of Wall Street " and " The Secret life of Walter Mitty " , or more simply " Walter Mitty " .
The first one is basically based on a true story of the main character , a financial broker , who is acted by the famous Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio and on how he become rich by breaking the rules and speculating on the stock exchange market .
I would define it an action movie .
Walter Mitty instead deals with the fantastic story of the main character , an archivist , whose life will been changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors .
Walter Mitty is acted by an excellent Ben Stiller , now arrived at the top of his career as actor .
Far from the noisy and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street , Walter Mitty offers to the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character 's life and adventures , through which he will discover his true self and will restart a new life .
Although presenting a more vivacious plot , The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does .
I must say that The secret dream of Walter Mitty is a well - constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who would spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie .
Dear Sir or Madan ,
My name is Rebeca Costa and I am writing this letter about the advertisement for job in the USA Sumer Camps .
I am 32 years old and even thought I live in Brazil I have a fluent English level .
In order to improve my English skills and also have a chance to meet new people from all around the world I have got very excited about that position available .
I think that I can help you on several camps activities , because of my background in volunteer work I have experience not only in the kitchen but also organising and managing some youth sports games in my neighborhood .
Please I would like to know more information on how to proceed to apply and when this job will commence .
It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles .
It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport .
It can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways .
It is true in many cases as public transport like buses , trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops .
This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination .
Secondly , public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity .
In modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy , which in turn has helped people to have them .
Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car .
In conclusion , i would say that due to recent advancements in society , there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership .
It can therefore be predicted easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future .
I think that when you want to get famous because of something that you do ( for example : writing musical ) you have to accept what comes with it .
It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties which I find awful .
However , there are also those kinds of people that get famous for doing nothing or just being rich as it 's the case of Paris Hilton .
We can see that people get famous when they die , so , journalists are basic to create a negative or positive point of view of that person .
They are just people , but not like you or me , or at least I do n't have a fabulous ferrari to comfort me when I 'm sad .
The difficult to learn something .
In our word it 's impossible to live without using technology .
Some people said that the world could be better if it 'll return to the past where the life was more simply .
It 's impossible to stop the science .
The question is whether the older people are disadvantage in using technology in confidential way .
One can not ignore that it 's more easy for young people to improve their knowledge than the older .
It depends on the capacity of children to learn more fast than the old adults .
There are not doubts : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example explain well and calm the use of new technology to an old man or woman , at the end , also these people are in conditions to use it .
New technology consists , for instance , in smart phone , tablet , pc .
There are some old people who are interested to know how work technology , but others who are not interested at all .
For these last one , it 's not necessary to use technology , because they can continue to live without using it .
To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results could be lower than their expectations .
Dear Sir/ Madame ( director the film department )
I am writing this letter , because the last week I read a notice in your STUDENT FILM CLUB magazine about a movie or thriller that I like it and I can advise you .
Well , last Sunday , I went to the cinema and I watched THE TITANIC , perhaps the movie counts us , the typical story the rich girl falls in love with the poor boy .
But the best of all for me is the sinking of the ship , when it fell down to bottom of the ocean .
the film explains us how happened the fact of the same way that in the near XIX century .
The director has wanted to make the story the best real possible .
He explains us the building of the ship , why it sank , how it stood in the bottom ocean and how the people helped them one to others .
I really like the beginning of the movie , because we can see the ship when it was really new , with their chair , table and another furniture .
In my opinion I think that the love story is enclosed to explain better the sinking .
As requested by a local tourist office , this is a report regarding shopping facilitiesin my town and shops that will appeal to tourists with different interests .
One of them which includes all interests is Afi Palace Cotroceni .
Regarding the actual shopping , it has more than 30 shops with a variety of things , from fashionable clothes to delicious food and even squaint books .
Moreover , it is a source of entertainment starting with children to elders .
In fact .
it has 2 different cinemas , one with Imax option .
Called in a malicious way , there are 6 floors for jewerly , clothes , accessorises , gadgets , books etc .
On the last floor is the food court , closed aired which is by far too populated and full of smoke .
Being in the centre of Bucharest , you can go outside , in downtown to consider visiting new cultural things while shopping in boutiques and relaxing on a terasse with a cool lemonade .
In addition to that , cheap is the best word describing the costs .
To sum up , it would seem that Downtown is a preferable place , with better value for money .
Although using your own car is betten for moving around the city , public transport has shown to be a good way for travelling lost distances with a low cost and , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There is not probably a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living today ; that is , if enterprises continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .
In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to enhance if the companies in charge want citizens to use their buses , trains and other public vehicles in the future .
Those improvements may include lowering the price , reducing the times or offering new destinations and more resources .
The aim of this report is to share the experience of different students who had been working abroad during the summer .
Every single one of them said that if you work abroad , you will improve your English a lot since you will be listening and speaking it all day .
However , almost every student confessed having felt homesick despite the fact that they made a large amount of friends there .
Another drawback is that unless you are really motivated , it will be difficult for you to adapt to a new city .
there are few things which I am very keen and passionate of , in the whole world .
one of these it 's surely my sport .
I have been practicing swimming pool since I was six years old , now I am twenty one . this should not let you stay without a clue of how much I care about my hobby .
This is not just a sport but an extraordinary thing I do in the ordinary life , in the everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrating , sick of the passing fancies or fake friends , there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it : this is , of course , swimming .
So I let myself drop in the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged , all the problems , sadness and heaviness of life suddenly disappear , and that 's the most amazing emotion i could ever try .
If I had to suggest a sport to do for children , I would recommend it because whether it makes everyone be in shape , it is healthy and guarantee an upper level of wealth .
I advise the parents to let the children begin swimming as soon as they can , provided they are interested in it .
It is not worth saying each one should follow their passions .
I 'll finish saying that even when I was young if my father had asked me if I would have rather go to a swimming race or to a candy fair , I would have surely chosen the first one .
I find it difficult to have a healthy way of life currently .
First of all the environment is contaminated and these substances get to us by water , air , food ... also the clothes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves around , although we were living in the country or far from the industries .
If you want to live with health , you must understand it and try to choose between the few real options you have in your hands .
The main advice it would be to have a balanced diet : a lot of fruits and vegetables , few fats , to drink more water , etc .
Then it is very important to exercise because your body and your mind need movement .
If you do not have enough time for exercise every day you can make little efforts : do not use the lift , use the stairs or walk every time you can .
But the most important thing for having a healthy life is to be quiet , not feel stress .
Nowadays we have a hurries lives but we must stop and live our lives too .
Your health needs calm , friendship , happiness ... You must keep in contact with your friends and to spend time with yourself ( do not forget your hobbies and learn new things ) and your familiy .
I think it would be the best advice .
It is known that Internet makes things easier than ever and can be used for everything .
There are plenty of webs that can search people , meet them and chat with the same interests and commons you like .
I have very good friends thanks on the Internet .
However , there are a lot of malicious software around the Internet and you must be aware .
You do n't have to do the silly or illegal things , because you will be exposed to this malicious software .
In addition , that software is created by nasty people that creates this virus to damage other people computers .
In my opinion I must express the facilities given by the Internet .
It 's all so easy with it and useful , for example you can order a pizza to take to your home
To sum up , I 'm totally agree with making friends through the Internet .
Did you know that your brain is exercised when you read any books ? You should read the topic that you prefer like news , sports , novels , economics , health , fitness , food , cooking and you can choose the material that it 's easy and enjoyable to read like novels , magazines , newspaper , technical books and something like that .
When you have finished your studies and you have gotten a job where every day you do the same activities , the brain does n't work hard and you might have some problems like forget words , dates , information that you had learned a few years ago because your memory wo n't work in the same way .
I think that your brain is like your body , they both need exercise to be active and the way to get it is reading something .
I 'm sure if you read or listen to audio book just 1 hour every day , you are going to feel a change quickly . I know that getting reading habits is difficult , but you start to do it , you wo n't be able to get enough of them and you will read for pleasure .
Finally , if you get Reading habit you 're going to organize better your ideas and you may feel more energetic , if you do n't believe me , just try it .
Dear Sir or Madame
I wish to apply for the post of worker in an USA summer camp that was advertised in the newspaper this Monday .
This occupation is of great interest to me as it reflects my determination in life and requires my education , skills and experience .
With majors in linguistics ( to be more precise , the English and Chinese languages ) , I have recently garnered second higher education in psychology .
This follows that on the one hand I have extensive knowledge in how to be on good terms with different people and on the other hand I have a perfect coomand of English .
Two years ago I worked as an interpreter and an organizer of Waterski World Championship in Moscow .
In addition , as I was determined to build my career as a teacher since my very childhood and , moreover , I definetely have a way with children of any age , after graduation I gained experience at University and local school .
I have been teaching English for 5 years already and I would dare to say that this job was made for me .
In terms of my personality , I am very hardworking , enthusiastic to wide range of activities , open and friendly .
My opinion is rooted in my experience so I really enjoy interacting with people , especially children , and to tell you the truth I like cooking and experience new things in general .
I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this posistion .
I welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you .
Sincerely ,
Badminton for every Age
A wise man in the past said once , " If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climer , the strength of a shot putter , the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer . "
Badminton is my favourite sport art .
It 's exhausing and you have to move fast to get every birdy .
You have to be competitiv !
You can play it in every age .
My coatch was very nice and mostly we played in teams .
I had a lot of fun at the sommer sport camps and I met a lot of friends .
With the badminton club in our city we traveled to different city 's and countries .
If you want to start playing badminton you should look for a badminton club near by and should sign up for a training class .
If you do n't know what racket you should buy , you will get all information at the club .
Mostly the Badminton Clubs sell all kinds of Badminton equipment for beginners and professionals . Do n't be lazy !
When you start playing you should practice minium twice a week , better three times a week .
Envide your friends from school or work .
Practice together with people in your age is a lot of fun und you will get better soon .
I play usually three times a week and I had a tournament last weekend .
Every lost game gives me more motivation to practice harder and every won games makes me proude and smile for all the hard work that I have done in the last few mounth .
In our Badminton Club we have a lot of members over the age of sixty years old .
Those films are really good , you have drama , romance , and thriller , those films are very entertaining .
I think you are going to like them because you like that kind of movies and also they are worth the while and you are not going to regret it .
Another thriller that is really good is the cabin in the woods , that movie is really entertaining , and scary .
if you like scary thrillers this movie is the one for you to watch , i do n't remember it very well , but it is also mysterious so you are going to like that one
This place does n't appear in History books , however it symbolises better than others a change in our country .
This building is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a short walk from the magnificent Gaudi 's artwork it is n't as famous as them .
Particularly in Barcelona , the trouble was that they could fish on the sea but there was n't an aproppiate place to keep it so they could n't eat one or two days later .
That situation must have been terrible for the population but fortunately , there is always a possible solution .
A group of fishers began to walk around the city looking for a good place where they would have brought their fish .
Finally , they found an old destroyed palace and they decided to build there their own " fish 's shopping centre " .
Neighbours helped them to make the building and after a few months , they began to use it .
This is a great example of how Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without government 's help .
Nowadays , the building has been become a luxury mall with the most expensive brand clothes .
However , the structure has been kept in order to visitors can enjoy this popular architecture 's jewel .
As the story continued people kept thinking that fish were polluted .
The homeless man noticed it too , although he did n't care because he will always obtain free food .
As always after having fish for dinner he had a strange dream .
He was dreaming it was his time to go fishing ; he went so far that he saw a kind of battle between sharks and whales .
He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle was n't really a battle it was a revolution , were the fish where the citizens .
Which meant some of fish were damaged thanks to the revolution , which also meant that while they were reproducing , the genes of the baby were changed .
And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish , they will taste different or simply change its form .
The fish where going to the beach were , the people fished .
That was his entire dream , he was now scared to know if that was real or not .
But it was too illogical to be true ; the good thing was that he was n't the one that would go and fish , which will be the leader .
After a few days of waking and only eating fish , they continued having the same allergic reaction to the fish thanks to their nutrition .
They will notice quickly because fish will smell worse than it already did .
When he woke up from his dream kind of having a skeptic attitude , but he was diminishing it .
After walking for a lot of days , the ' survivors ' were worried , and thinking of how much they would still need to walk to find a city , also they were thinking that maybe they were going forward one day and backwards the next day .
You start live on your own , make your own decisios and plan your future .
On the one hand , there are a large amount of teenagers who have no idea for their future .
They do n't know which university and field of studying choose .
During a gap year you have the chance to consider all the issues connected with your future .
You have enough time to try to use your capabilities and at the same time discover your own calling .
Besides , there are a great number of people who graduated school but do n't have enough money to continue their education .
The year off gives the apportunities to get a job .
In the beginning it would be a simply and without high wages job but you would get some experience .
You can get to know other countires and new individuals .
On the other hand , I can see also negative aspects of taking a year off .
You start your study later comparatively with your friends .
It would be more difficult to start your own life by oneself .
It is also a point that when you do n't execute what you wanted to during a gap year , you are in the same place when you were graduating school .
To sum up , I think that taking a year off is an important decision you should give it a thought before you finally decide .
I am writing to you in order to apply for the position of a camp assistant in Summer Fun Ltd.
Last year I attended an art course , which taught me how to make interesting things only with my hands and fantasy .
I have a certificate for high achievement in areas of painting and designing things of clay .
In addition , recently I passed my First Aid Course , which was quite useful for me .
I am fond of children and I like to be around them , so that it will be a pleasure for me to gain this job .
Among my colleagues and friends , I have a reputation to be mature , responsible and easy - going person .
I grew up in a family , which members speak fluently Italian and Spain .
I believe that this will give me the chance to consider my application and got the job .
Nowadays , television is very important in our lives because there are a lot of benefits and advantages of watching TV .
In my opinion TV is useful because we can learn many interesting things and also reduce stress watching TV .
Everyone can choose something suitable for themselves .
The men usually choose sports programs , which are really popular on the TV nowadays .
It is a cheaper way to watch their favourite team than spending money for an expensive ticket .
I went late to the gas station today because I left my keys in the bathroom and I locked myself in the bathroom .
Someone came and opened the bathroom and I got my keys and started to work .
Today I had 2 hours driving session .
Driving instructor picked me at the gas station and from there we went to a parking lot near AMC and practised parallel parking and k - turn .
After that I practiced turns and driving on the road .
The instructor dropped me back to the gas station and from there I took a bus to Princeton and from there I transferred to another bus to my home .
Dear Madam and Sir

We were faced with the real problem of lack of time for translating , especially closer to the end when our translators have worked with very large texts .
Whether it would be possible for you to increase the period of one topic studying ? for example 2 weeks for each unit ?
It makes the studying more effective and comfortable for us .
We 're also waiting for information about you fee , order of payments and other terms of working .
You can play tennis either in a closed space or outdoor , so you can also play it if it is raining outside .
I do n't like doing a sport in a closed space , such as gyms , in fact , I always do whatever I can to play tennis outdoor though it 's not a beautiful day .
I find it helps me a lot because it takes my mind off .
If you want to play this sport , I have to make a really big effort and try to train as much as possible .
I reckon it 's a quite expensive sport , but if your parents give you a pocket - money , you will not have any problems .
I 'm trying to drink a cup of strong coffee but it does n't help .

Watching quiz programs are a main way to educate oneself .
Watching history channel gives us great information about the history of earth .
Watching national geographical or discovery channels takes us into a world of animals where we get to see numerous wild animals and their characteristics which are really interesting .
Daily watching news on television enlightens us on what 's happening around the world .
Being aware of current affairs are important in our life .
There are also many disadvantages of television .
There are plenty of entertainment programs which just consume our time with no other benefits .
Entertainments are a must , everyone should take time off from their busy or hectic schedule .
But it should be in a moderate level .
Estimated USA SUMMER CAMPS department of human resources ,
I am wrtitting this letter as an answer to the job advertisement for working in a summer camp in which I am quite interested . .
I am actually studying a marketing and market research degree at Malaga 's University , in September I will start my last year of course , which I hope to finish next year .
although I am still studying , I also work at weekends as a football referee in the province of Málaga , I consider myself as a person with a high control when I work with big groups and also a person who likes to lead groups and with a good ability to work under pressure .
I am used to work with children who are under 12 years old , because I usually do kids matches when I referee .
the only idea of working in the kitchens it really excites me , because I would like to provide my experience cooking , I started it as an obligation because my parents where always working but finally I liked it , and now I do all sorts of deserts and meals .
Finally , I want to thank you for your attention and I hope to have a future contact soon .
The first one is to catch an express bus from the airport to the metro station " Yuzhnaya " and then to change a bus for another one going to my town where I can meet you at the bus station .
I might pick you up from the airport by car .
As for the weather , it 's quite nice at the moment but I suggest taking something warm just in case as the weather is very changeable here .
I 'm really satisfied as there were about 200 competitors and so I would have never thought to be the winner .
I think he will be enthusiastic when I tell him the news .
Mr. Green , I 'm really keen to know who is the professional film director .
Waiting for your answer .
The perfect hotel I would love to work should be located in my country .
Since many European tourists attempt to have their holidays on the beach enjoying the sun shine and also discover the historical remanings from the past , Antalya ( Turkey ) is the best city to work .
So I could take the advantage of my foreign language knowledge .
The hotel should provide variety of cousins from the world , therefore the clients could eat whatever they wish .
For disable people there should be expanded services to give them easy mobility .
For couples who have babies there should be baby care services .
There should be a bar which is 24 hours opened .
The hotel should have all inclusive concept so before people go for holiday , they could calculate their costs .
Also the food should be provided from the company .
The most important aspect that the hotel should have , it should be opened whole year , not only in the summer .
lessons to their computers by their teachers .
This new way of teaching pupils has received a mix response .
Firstly , being at schools with lots of other children in a class develops your social skills , but learning at home , makes you lose contact with others .
When you do the lessons , you have nobody to chat to it about .
Also , staying regularly on the computer is a way to get glasses .
Electronics are bad for our eye .
Penultimate , there has been a sudden rise in obesity because of this new project .
Travelling to school at least includes 1 meter of walking , nevertheless staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and health .
Schools provide you with healthy food despite the fact we 'll just eat anything we want at home .
Finally , I personally disagree with cyberschol .
Cyberschol are n't interested in health and safety issues !
Now that they are back home , Paulina found out that her mom was in town , so by instinct she decided to go and visit her , as well his brother that has been evading her because she taunted him by being in love with his best friend , they are n't together anymore , but that was such a devastating thing .
Genuinely she knew , that begging him was n't enough , so by going to their old house as a surprise would be at least would give her the chance to confront instead of making a chaos about it , despite this insignificant fraud she knew her mom would be really happy to see her daughter .
She called Jimmy and told him where she was going , but Jimmy did n't answer since he was at work , so she left a voice message .
The condition of the public transport is getting worse day by day .
There are only limited numbers of government buses on the road and their frequency are not good so they get overcrowded .
People board these buses out of compulsion as they have to reach office on time .
On the other hand , metro service is a good medium of transportation , it goes over the road so you do n't get traffic .
The waiting time is minimum , you get a train in every 3 to 5 minutes .
The fare of the metro train is almost equal to the other transport means .
The only flaw of metro service is its unavailability in remote areas .
After a few kilometer , you will find a bus stop but Metro stations are built only in major areas .
So even if you travel through metro , you have to take a bus or auto to reach your destination unless it is located near a metro station .
People who are rich prefer to travel by their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience .
In public transport many people do n't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey , it is very exhausting especially in a long journey .
While in a private vehicle you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey .
If we take out the cost factor , there is not a single reason for anyone to travel through public transport .
Many crimes such as pickpocketing , eve teasing , violence , etc take place in public transport .
It has been an easy target of terrorists to plant bombs , so if you are traveling through a bus , you accept the risk .
Everyone can not afford a car so public transport would be there but in future as well but fewer people will use it .
Our company is a small and based company which works within the same field for almost 50 years .
One of our seniors workers will retire in a month and therefore As I 'm in charge of the Human Resources department has to start the search of a new employee .
It is a commonly held view that an experienced worker will facilitate the search of .
However , I would like to review another options such hiring a recent graduate from a renowned university .
Any experienced worker would bring a sense of calm , steadiness , wisdom , commitment and experience of course .
He will contribute with his life experience , and he will request for better working conditions as salary , family times , and health insurance .
However , a recent graduate will be avid to accumulate knowledge and fearless of trying a different approach .
In my opinion , recent graduates are ambitious , without prejudices and most of them are not family people as of yet .
Their lifes are focused on their careers .
In conclusion , I would say that a recent graduate would be a great asset for our company as they accomplished our targets .
Firstly , it is true that they have similar relationships that we could have many years ago .
The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch , such as emails and messages , instead of writing letters , which took much time to arrive .
In fact , it ccan help them to speak with their friends more easily .
There is a strong argument for believing these resources can prejudice their writing skills .
There is another problem relates to safety .
Generally , young people do n't have any problem in posting their personal photos on the Internet .
But when do this , they expose a lot of details about themselves , details that everyone can see , especially strange people .
In conclusion , I think that social networks can constitute a big problem , especially for people who are not aware of what dangerous there are on the internet .
I 'm so happy to hear you 'll come to visit me !
Now I explain to you , how to reach my home from the airport .
After leaving the airport , you have to take the bus number 14 and you have to get off at the third bus stop .
After you can take the bus , which drives you to Chiari .
You surely remember that place because the last time you came , you told me that it was the worst train station where you 've never been .
In May the weather is usually sunny , but in the evening could be colder than during the day .
I look forward to seeing you to spend together this month .
Television currently occupies a very important role in entertainment , however , one of the problems that society has faced since television became popular is that it is a distractor in education .
It is believed , there are ways to make TV can help educate .
In addition , many of the educational programs are not transmitted by broadcast television and people without cable system , have no access to these .
So the TV could become a useful tool in the educational process if more effort is put into this , from the television programming to the preference of society-
It is argued that whether the government or teachers have the right to determine what subjects should be taught in schools .
In my opinion , although there are some advantages if teachers were responsible for this task , I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission .
There are two main advantages of teachers deciding what subjects taught in schools .
Firstly , each teacher would be able to teach courses according to their own expertise , which leading to a more advanced and high - quality teaching .
Secondly , teacher can select subjects that are more useful for local culture .
And it will be difficult for examining students ' ability in a national scale .
Moreover , not all teachers have the ability to design a high - quality course map .
If the decision is made by central authorities , the most obvious advantage is that the estimation for students ' grades could be standardized in the whole country .
For example , a fair grade judging system is essential in an Joint College Entrance Examination .
Although some drawbacks may exist when this task determined by the central authorities , a committee comprising experts in different disciplines can minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusion , while there are advantages and disadvantages for both central authorities and teachers leading this task , I prefer the government to do so .
In my opinion it 's true , however , family is a very important part in your life and you have to take care of it .
On the one hand , friends is like a family because you live together a lot of experiences and adventures .
They are essentials to share secrets or any thing .
It is better to be alone than badly company .
Not only because they than taken at world but also they are always say the truth .
Not only what you want to hear .
They to want better for you , and always they will be by your side .
In conclusion , so family and friends are very necessaris in your life .
If you feel love , share it!Every day may be the last .
Both texts contribute different approaches to music industry .
Accordingly , the first one considers if the activity has been affected by file sharing whereas the second analyses the live performance success in the present technological era .
The first text asserts that file sharing benefits new artists and offers listeners a wide choice of styles , despite the fact it is believed that file sharing is detrimental for the music industry .
Additionally , the writer suggests that it has some potential which can be used by CD industry .
The second text assesses the attraction of concerts despite the present high quality of recorded music , and suggests that the reasons to succeed may be the communal experience and its offer of different songs and performances that make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , music industry should adapt to new technologies and habits of users .
On the other hand , personally speaking , I 've always felt amazed by the attraction of concerts over large audiences , thereby in my opinion , the second text offers a good reasons to explain this phenomenon .
I 'm very excited about your arrived in Santa Cruz next week ; I 'll give you some advice about awesome places to visit .

I think my favourite sport is cycling and swimming in summer or spring and skiing in winter .
Because I can cycling and swimming almost whenever . I might say in every season .
That 's the main reason I love it .
When it 's cold I always go to a cover swimming pool and when the weather is warm or hot and the sun is shining I always go to a reservoar .
Instead of cycling in winter . I would n't do it because according to my opinion it is quite dangerous .
And the skiing .
That 's the one of the possibilities which and I can do in winter when I want to be out . Instead of a walk or snowboarding .
But I like it because I go to the mountains with my friends every year and we always have a lot of fun and that 's a great time for each other of us .
I think it has more positives than negatives . I do something for myself because I 'm on the fresh air and I do some activity for my body .
On the other hand , I can have a cold and temperature or something like that .
Casar de Cáceres is located in the north of Cáceres , you can see a lot of amazing things in this spectacular villa .

Discover this beautiful town with the five senses ;
Watching the sunset die between the humble houses and four chapels , one in each of the cardinal points , dedicated to Santiago , San Bartolomé , Los Mártires and La Soledad .
You can smell and taste the gastronomic delight that offer , such as the stunning Torta del Casar with denomination of origin .

Owing a car certainly makes trips faster and easier .
Many drivers regard travelling by car as a future means to travel which helps people save much time .
However , others believe that public transport is better due to the fact that public transport is environmentally friendly .
To my belief , there does exist a promising future for public transport .
It is a known fact that travelling by cars is less green than by public transport .
In the present - day society , sustanable development is of paramount important as our environment is being destroyed on a fast pace .
Using public transport helps save up resources such as fuel and electricity .
If ones insist on travelling by cars , they are , in fact , producing greenhouse gases which are given out by their cars .
It is surely not envirnmentally friendly .
All in all , public transport should be an indispensable part of our future plan because we have to protect our beautiful environment . Travelling by cars , although much more convenient , is never a clever choice for the betterment of our future society with the severe environmental issues .
Public transport is still vital part of society and should remain as it is .
If everyone start using car for traveling ; the road wo n't be enough to everyone as there are seven billion people in the world ; and even for environment it is better to use as less as possible .
The government and public body should start thinking about it and to save the society public transport is the best .
Certain age people wo n't be able to drive a car so that they definitely need the public transport .
I can understand the use of public transport is decreasing now a day , but there is still future for it .
Everyone should think about it which is really vital for the society ; and specially the international body should do something about it to motivate people to use public transport as much as possible .
So in summary to save the environment , to make the road accessible to everyone public transport should have been used and we all should try to educate people about the importance of public transport .
Michael was a 25 years boy .
He was very beautiful and many girls wished him to become their boyfriend .
She was his neighbour and they love each other from when they were young .
They live in a little town in the Massachusetts .
He asked Jessica to come with her , but she did n't agree because before marrying him she would try to see if their love could hold out against everything , also the distance .
So she prepared her luggage and she went to say goodbye to him .
He was very angry , so he told her : " if you leave , do n't come back to me , nevermore . "
She was disappointed and try to explain her thought to him , but he did n't want to understand her reasons .
He was afraid to lose her and he did n't want to try to trust her and their love .
" If you think so go away , forever ! " told Michael .
Jessica did n't answer , but she looked at him for the last time while she walked away .
When somebody travels , this person wants to never forget the place he has visited .
Then it is very important going to this store and choosing an object that makes you remind the most exciting day of the trip , a gorgeous monument you have seen , ...
Therefore , you will be assessed politely .
If you are like them , it will raise your eyebrows due to the huge variety of sports equipment you will see .
Nevertheless , the sport store is a little expensive .
However , these three ones are the most visited by tourists , so they will not disappoint you .
Some people say that are not future for public transport .
They argue that a large number of people prefers travelling in private transport , because it is more comfortable and convenient .
But it is true ?
Travelling by car can give you a certain status quo and make you feel more independent , besides the comfort and convenience .
However I believe the public transport still be very important in our society and has a huge future .
Firstly , travelling by bus or in other public transport,(as underground ) , help us to decrease the emissions of gas , which causes pollution and global warming .
Secondly we all know that the public transport is cheaper than the private transport .
And the last , ( but not the least ) , public transport is muche safe than the private , because it transports much more people , and so , there is more cauttion .
Detoxification , a method people often use to lose weight , has not been proved by the science .
People think that it is a common and effective way , but I believe once there is no scientific evidence , it should not be brought to the weight loss process .
In fact , some people just understand an aspect of this method , that is to say , they have applied wrong method .
Take an example for this , some teenagers drink detox water instead of meals for three or four days in order to lose weight quickly .
However , the way has brought some unexpected results due to their wrong concept .
In fact , some deaths have been caused by bringing detoxification to weight loss process , because they follow the majority without carefully considering .
Generally speaking , the method has not been demonstrated by the scientists , so it is better to avoid it in order not to get some unexpected consequences .
Film stars and politicans are interesting for people because of their talents and special abilities .
Of course , people want to know some facts of personal life of famous people , but often star dont'n like when journalists try to get in their life .
On the one hand , famous people try to hide thier life from journalists .
In the everyday life , the internet has became one of the most important things and it is becoming more and more influental .
On the first hand , I would like to talk about the fact that with the help of the internet we can easily stay in touch with any of our friends .
There are community sites like Facebook , which have a built in messenger .
On the other hand though , people can become anti social , just because of the lack of real face to face meetings .
In the second part , with the internet we can follow the news and current affairs very quickly and we do not have to wait for the news on the television , and we do not have to buy newspapers .
It is more time efficient and in my point of view it is more easier .
However these news can be false .
In conclusion , the internet have pros and cons , but it can be very useful and fun to use .
Gnadenthal is a very small , consisting of almost only one single drivable road village , which is not famous for its size , though .
What is really special about this little village is the Christian brotherhood , living there more than 1000 years .
That probably is the reason why the local circumstances are still similar to the ones of the Middle Ages , exclusive of some infrastructural improvements that made deceases like plaque redundant .
The few houses themselves are set around a very old , Romanesque church , which is bordered by a traditional farmyard for growing sheep and cows .
Nearby , fields with growing vegetables can be visited , which never has been altered by any modern machine but only by the power of hand and cattle .
Gnadenthal is exceptionally suitable for people who want to take some time off their hard and stressful daily life in order to find calmness and to think about themselves in a way of their character .
Hi bro , Whats up by there?.I'm going to recommend you to give up from sport , as I told you too many times , sport its bad for health , it makes you to be all day with legs or arms broken or something like this , and the music is improving and stimulating your brain and intelligence .
But also I told you that if you are so good in sports you might get a grant for your studies which will get worth it so I do n't know , in my opinion I would continue with the music if you are good at cause is better for your brain but also sports can relax you and make you disconnect so if I were you I would think about it and compare which of both of them you like more or makes you feel better or relax more or just makes you laughed or have a good time .
Well there is my opinion I will ask some friend about and I will try to write you another letter in a few days to help you more , also if you have another problem , do n't forget to ask me for help please , I will help you in all you want .
See you my Nigga ¡
Generally , it seems a modest sport or simple hobby , but permit meeting more and more people along the urban streets who make jogging too .
So , I enjoy running alone or with friends , because this sport have a lot of possibilies , more than I believed when I started to run after finishing High School .
Therefore , we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths than pavement .
Later , I have had more roommates , colleagues and partners even who practised this sport , which is among the most fashionable ones at this moment .
Moreover , the races are masser and masser and more and more popular .
But , for the beginners , I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence , and practising with company because running may be bored , tired , dangerous , even , but if you get a strong spirit and will power , you 'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses .
Many kinds of sport which the favourite of mine is Karate .
Karate made me strong and let me know how to face something I scared before .
I enjoyed it and got achievability from it .
Through the train of Karate , I understand myself really .
The train of Karate helps me overcome many difficult things on my learning way .
If you want to try it .
Karate is not a difficult skill sport .
It 's an easy and a good healthy sport .
Just like playing a game .
Opening your mind , do n't be chicken and you 'll find different one about you !
Even though there have been many efforts to make people use their car less , we have to admit that this battle is already lost .
Since most of these public transport amendments have been remedial rather than something planned foreseeing future problems , they have only been of limited help and , therefore , they have only worked for some time .
This has resulted in only the very in - need people using public transport , and the vast majority of people still use their personal automovile , with the incovemiences and safety being an excuse .
One ca n't imagine how many germs ( virus included ) lay on a hand bar waiting for a skin to rush in .
Only thinking of eat makes me crazy .
So , little by little , and as economic conditions of people improves , public transport will eventually disappear .
At first , I have to admit that I hate any kind of sports , because I know I 'm not good at them .
In the past , I tried to play basketball , tennis , ping pong and so on , but the outcome made me depressed and less confedent .
However , after I came to New Zealand , I found a special sport which does n't need any ability , trekking .
The biggest benefit of trekking is that you can enjoy fantastic view from the summit of mountains .
Also you are able to choose a place to go depend on how you feel .
If you are interested in trekking , you should buy water - proof clothes just in case .
If you do so , You do n't have to be worried about bad weather any more .
Do n't forget to bring some drink as well .
In some place , you will find difficulty in finding it .
To conclude , trekking is one of the most enjoyable sports even for people do n't like sports like me .
Let 's start trekking as soon as possible , otherwise you will miss opportunity to see fabulous scenery .
During the last decades , the number of cars used in big cities has increased steadily . Proportionally , air pollution and deaths associated to traffic accidents have also augmented .
However , there is a great debate on whether this is really a good solution .
It moves more people per liter of oil used and contaminates a small fraction of what it would had been if every passenger had traveled using an individual car .
Instead of taking your seat right home , you need to go to a more or less far place in order to take a public transport , and wait for the time it is scheduled to arrive .
The action has to be repeated when you leave the bus or train at the end of your journey .
One thing which we could be sure is that the world is changing but public transport existed in the past and will be in the future .
First point , which I would like to menchioned about is cost .
You need to spend a lot of money when you want to buy it , when you want to insurance it and use it .
Cars are n't cheep and if you think that is easier to move form one place to another when you have a car , you have got a point but there is a lot of considerations which you should occur like : gas , insurance or parking cost .
Moreover , you should recon about comfort during the travel .
When you driving by the car you should be focus on the road , you need to think what could happen , what the other drivers want to do and which way you should chose .
That could be frustrating especialy when you have long road and you need to spend long hours driving .
Finaly , the word conviniend for everyone means something dirrerent .
For one person that would be option yaht you have car which is parked along your road or on your drivway and on any time you could go whenever you want , for the orher that would be pleasur that they coud enjoy the trip without thinking about any car 's issues , They are faitfull that they could meet some new people and take part with others life .
I 'm in the class 4B in Liceo Darwin in Rivoli .
I can start with saying something about advantages : we are not just classmates but we are friends .
Many of us hang out together during weekends and they have become a group , like me and my other three close friends , but also " best friend " .
Another advantage could be teachers : they are quite strict sometimes but they make us studying harder and this is not so easy to do with teenagers .
But the most important one is that if you are too bored or tired you can look out over a great sight of Turin or mountains from a class ' window .
But there are some disadvantages like stairs because we are at the second floor . We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many strairs to reach our classroom and that 's so annoying sometimes .
We share the floor with another school and it has a different timetable and the bell rings 10 minutes before and it makes me confused but I really like 4B and I would n't change it .
At the start of the 20th century , almost no - body had a car .
Furthermore , travelling by car is a very comfortable way of transport .
For instance we can use cars radio to listen to some relaxing music , or listen to news while making our way to the place we want to go .
As you may be concerned , cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages .
Nowadays people are depending on them too much .
Cars are being used even when not necessary .
In addition , cars have been increasing the world carbon emission and that causes the ' Ozone Layer ' to thin down .
Finally , for our car to work , we need to fill them with fuel , which is expensive .
Unfortunately we should be careful with the way we use them .
You gave me a fantastic new saying you are coming next year !
Italy is well regarded about its education .
Travelling could be a good way to improve your lenguage and to know better Italy .
You should absolutely visit Rome and Florence !
These are both amazing because are full of history ; in the first one you can still see Romans'monuments instead Florence offers lots of Medieval churches .
Meaybe you 'd choose to attend univeristy in one of these cities !
It is a turist country , you may work as a waiter in my city .
Tell me exactly when will you arrive as soon as possible !
Adam was twelve years old , a clever boy in his school , always gets the top marks and participate in most activities , known for all the teachers and students .
He also participated in the school football team and won the state club .
Despite all previous things Adam was alone , has no friends in school or in abbeywood street in Queensland where he lived in Australia and Adam was very annoyed about that and what make it worth a boy called Johnny who had insulted him and Adam did n't want to have a fight with him .
two weeks later , Adam began to make some friends but from his bad luck , they were n't very good friends , they used to make troubles and do n't do their home work in time .the boys were Fernando and Louis in their seventh year in school as Adam .
The math teacher in school Mr Michael was a very good teacher who takes care of children in school .
He realized Adam 's marks are getting low and he involved in some troubles in school and began to investigate him .
In the final exam Mr Michael caught Adam cheating and inform the school 's manager who suspended Adam from all other exams and forced him to repeat the year .
In matter of fact Mr Michael should have provided some advice for Adam when his marks got low but he didn't , and the consequences were very bad so , Michael closed the door and know at that moment he had made a mistake .
I live in big city , the capital of Spain , so there are different transport .
I prefer to use the train or the tube , because they are punctual and because there are a signs where you can see the time less .
Also , every three or four minutes you can get on the train .
There are buses too , but I do not like them . Depend on the dot , there are traffic problems and you must wait a long time in a bus stop .
I am from a small island where only there is a form transport : the bus .
I am from a little town and I must wait one hour to go to the city center .
It is awful if you do not have a private transport .
I propose to use fewer cars .
I know this is not easy but there is an ecological and cheap transport : the bicycle .
For short distance it is a good way to do exercise and to avoid contaminating .
Of course it is not a way for long distance , but step to step , the traffic problems will improve .
But let me tell you that I was confused in the best way , not because it was rather wacky but because happenend unexpected .
There 's no question that this film by director Louis Leterrier is the most original and thought - provoking stories I have seen in recent years .
In fact , the box - office hit when it was released and the film went on to gross over 350 million .
The plot revolves around an FBI squad who face , in a game of cat and mouse , a team compounded of the best four illusionists .
As far as the storyline is concerned I have to say that the film is really fast - moving .
Regarding acting , taking into account that it is a big - budget film there is not much to say .
It is fairly well played by actors , such as , Jesse Eisenberg , Morgan Freeman who play their role perfectly , making the film light - hearted .
If I have to stand out any weakness I will say that is a bit predictable .
As it is a movie related to magic tricks when a sequence is played and it seems simple and easily understanable you know that , indeed , it is not .
We must reduce exam stress from high school students .
Exam stress leads to many bad consequences towards High School Students .
These consequences vary , one example would be that students may get lower grades on their exams , or even fail them .
As a result , many High School Students may not concentrate during classes , or whilst studying since they have many things on going through their heads ( since they 've been studying a lot ) .
Based on all the problems listed ( and many more ) , we must find solutions that will help both students and professors to deal with exam stress .
One of the solutions I would give is to hand in study guides to the students .
This will help them as a method to study or review for the exam and reduce their levels of stress .
The study guide does n't need to necessarily be a long and complex one ( since those may cause them stress too ) ; they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises .
Another simple solution I think could help is to study as well as to review content during sessions before a certain exam , to help the students study whilst still having a class .
The previous are the best possible solutions I would address in order to stop once and for all the problem of stress thanks to exams , in which most of the cases , as the previous paragraph explained , leads to many more .
When I was a child I used to spend thousands hours playing football , anywhere I could .
Always dreaming becoming a great player , playing in a stadium crowded , clapping their hands looking at what I did with the ball .
When I grew up I realize sooner than later , that I will never be nor a good neither a bad player , and they said that I was one of the worst players ever lived .
Then I decided to study engineering and becoming one the best engineers ever .
Long after that due such I was a natural talent about engeneering , I began to write books and essays about everything realted with my job .
Life becoming bigger more and more .
Today you need more than what you needed yesterday .
People looking for comfortable easy life .
Many students today like to study abroad to get high level of life to get their life job and experience a new way of life .
companies are looking for well educated people with a good experience to hire and students more likely to fit their choices .
With your certificate you can easily fine a job .
Universities are also a rich place for big opportunity to get there if you have studied abroad .
Students who go to study in another country experience a variety of life .
Try new food in completely different places .
They can explore cities in weekends or academic breaks .
Learn how to do everything by themselves and become independent .
To sum up , studying abroad is a great chance to get a great job as you have higher education with much more experiences .
Moreover , you can learn many things and expand your knowledge , have friends from different backgrounds .
InBy February we 'll have finished our exams and we 'll have more free time .
For that reason we 're going to putting our name down at the gym and the swimming - pool .
Furthermore , on Tuesday and on Friday we wo n't have class and we will be able to go running and cycling .
Besides I 've a big surprise , apart from remembering our agreement , my father is taking up hiking with his friends and he has offered us to join in .
Nevertheless , what about having lunch on Saturday and speak it quietly ?
I know that this is something strange but I really enjoy it .
To begin with I am interested in birdwatching because from when I was young and I want to be a biologist when I grow up .
Birdwathcing really relax me and bring me closer to the nature .
Furthermore I enjoy being able to recognise the different species of birds .
So if someone really want to birdwatch , he should first know what species of birds there are in the area that he lives .
To sum up I believe birdwatching is a really exciting sport but you must like it to start it .
Sports or hobbies could be great options like new activities in order to plan in my college , however I believe there are others which could be provided for us and it would be interesting to take part in .
Do n't you know to say in the presence of a huge audence ?
Are you nervous when you have to speak on public ?
The new activity which I have thought it could be organised and it could have success is called " The Club of dicussion " .
It let us improving our hearing and speaking skills .
In addition , it could be interesting although you do n't have to do physical actitivy , because of your capacity to redaction a speech , support an idea , have a connected speech will be got better in this kind of activity .
What 's more , it does n't require a specific place to take place in , it could be trying anywhere .
I think that the allure of this activity is you can meet a lot of people and share with them that experiences .
Moreover , I think that it should become a reality because the field of the activity is so broaden and it could be useful in other plenty scope even in your daily routine .
In conclusion , making a speech contributes on our social relasionships and it allows us to define our personality .
I think that my college must provide an activity which is focused on the social abilities and it teaches you how you must speak in front of a multitude , and why not could be this ?
Thanks for your last letter .
I am glad to understood that everything is OK about you .
I am very grateful that you will help me with searching some information about colleges in England .
Actually , I am interested in science , especially area between chemistry and physics .
Also , it will be interesting for me tuition , which refers to biology and influence in different kind of chemical compounds over the human body .
You know that I had learnt biotechnology at school in Bulgaria .
Please , check for me , which colleges provide these subjects and when they start .
I want to know if it is available a grant .
If so , what is the criteria for giving it .
Last , but not least , what is the fee ? I want to find a college , which is not so expensive .
Customer satisfaction is much great when he gets service which has value or quality much greater than he expected .
If service meets only the expectation and does not provide anything more than it , means customer satisfaction is there but customer would not feel great .
If service is not meeting expectation of the customer or its quality just below expected , it causes customer dissatisfaction .
In this context it can be concluded that 78% of the respondents are satisfied with both the customer services of builders and results of Vasthu .
Rest of the respondents have positive feedback .
The factors which hinders other respondents from giving very positive feedback may be either dissatisfaction caused by customer service or failure of meeting results of vasthu to their expectations .
I like all kinds of movies . Comedies always make me laugh and I like it .
Also , I rest from the routine while watching it . I can relax and just watch , laugh and talk to my friends .
Another reason why I like comedies , there is a wide variety of this kind if movies .
Personally I , watch a comedy movie almost every evening .
They are short sighted and seems that they are brain - washed by radical democracy thoughts .
People who signed in the website were colluding foreign powers to suppress our own country , China .
I think this is traitors ' action .
Hong Kongers , being a Chinese , should not inhibit our own country , with other countries .
In fact , china will not be moved by this , and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong , China and the US .
It is better not to interfere the internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China 's politic conditions .
The US always keep " rule by law " as their catchphrase , but Occupying Central is betraying the Hong Kong law .
So it is very strange for US to say " rule by law " when they support Occupying Central .
In Occupying the Wall Street , the US did not seems to be much more peaceful than Tiananmen Massacre .
According to Wiki encyclopedia , FBI called the occupier as " terrorist " and decided to suppress the dispute as settling terrorist attack .
Apart from this , the president election in the US is full of unfairness .
I do not know if there is filter for president candidates , I just know that the ballots are counted in states .
There are different number of residents in different states , but it uses the states to represent the residents . I do not think the election is fair enough for the US to ask for " real democracy " for Hong Kong .
Is the US really target to get Hong Kong into a democracy area ?
I think not , but a democracy " country " .
The US always target on dividing China into many small , weak countries , then it can break up a competitor of itself .
Let us see counties that the US introduced " democracy " to it .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria , there were chaos for " democracy " everywhere , and the next , might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central would lead to chaos that similar to Tunisian Revolution .
The signature collection of the White House now ended .
I really hope Hong Kongers that signed in the website could think again what they were doing and how harmful it is to China .
And I really think the US could stop picking on China .
Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts both are considered crucial for students education .
Some people think that knowing fact is more easily and practicable .
Nevertheless , others consider learning ideas and concept is the best way to confront many academic and real - life problems .
In my view , l completely agree with the idea that it is important to students to learn idea and concept than learn facts .
First , learning facts can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face .
However , ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues .
For example , once I do n't grasp an idea that my teacher have explained in class , but just remember facts .
When I do my homework , I find the problem is different than the case discussed in the class .
While , I go back to my textbook and try to realize ideas and concepts .
From this experience , I learn that I do not just remember facts , but try my best to understand ideas and concept .
thus , I can solve many kinds of problem simply .
Second , learning ideas and concepts support self - education greatly .
It is easy to know facts from people around you .
However , learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks . .
Nowadays , there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in a certain subject .
When , students catch the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply .
For instance , when I was in senior year in high school .
It was massive materials on a specific issue , but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points .
In sum , absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy .
Not only do student learn more in their studying , but also they help students understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways .
If you ask me , who is the person who I admire the most ?
He is so brilliant , he speaks three languages , plays several instruments , and the most important of all , he is a man of remarkable principles .
When he was younger , he worked to the government but he had to quit because of the corruption .
He always wanted to have his own business , he used to say , if you work for somebody you are part of the problem , but if you hire people to work for you , you are part of the solution , so if you want to be successful , be your own boss .
He travelled a lot , he knows Barcelona , London , Paris , Stockholm , Miami and so many places .
He taught me my basic English , to playing tennis , to play the guitar , to dance , to sing and I can continue counting .
So , if I can end my days , been a little bit like him , the work will be finished and I could say I have been a good father just like him .
When I try to create in dreams , the home of the future the first thing , which I have in mind is new technology . in my opinion , homes in the future have to be different , this is connected with our society and development .
To begin with , I consider that many of homes , which will be create in the future must have robots .
They are designed to doing all things related to housework .
In general houses could have open space , a lot of windows and light everywhere .
And one of the most important thing for me , new homes should fly in the sky .
In my opinion , inside they will be looks still in the same way , maybe more technology connected with new inventions .
One of the most impressive solution will be swimming pool in the sky , near area .
All in all , future houses will be looking more like airplane , and less like normal home .
Because it was our first day at Algarve , we decided to explore , a bit more of the area .
We picked up our things and start to walk .
The first thing to visit , according to the plane , was the Albufeira center .
We find a very cosy and traditional houses , the market was very populary , with a lot of people walking around , and the people were very nice to us .
Near the restaurant we saw a very strange thing .
We saw a boy drawing my face , but I never saw that boy in my all life .
We decided to go talking with him .
He started being nervous when we question where he saw that girl .
He sad that girl , that he was drawing , is the most beautiful girl that he ever met in his whole life .
He explain that he saw that girls in the beach .
When we saw me in front of him , he immediately invited me to dinner with him .
Because I never heard beautiful words like that about me , I accepted the invitation without thinking .
When the night comes I went to the restaurant that he invited me to go .
I was dressing a short red dress and a black shoes .
The boy , Ruben , was wearing a shirt with a brown trousers .
Since then we have been in touch and by now we are dating . I think this is extraordinary .
Ruben is a very cute guy and I do not want to lose him never .
I tried with swimming , and I was found that so boring .
After that , I sign up into Karate classes but I did n't like combat sports like this .
But one day , my sport teacher gave me the opportunity to became a basketball player with nine years old .
Since that day , basketball became as my favourite sport .
The main reason which makes me love it , maybe that 's the teamwork , the feeling of unity when you 're in a big team and the sound of the net when the ball goes into the basket , it makes you go to the seven heaven .
You would like to become a basketball player too ?
If I were you , I would remember always a tip of Michael Jordan . "
A player could win a game , but only a team could win championships " .
All of us are surrounded of plastic , plastic is needed in our everyday life for a lot of things .
For this reason when a woman and her family decided to live a whole month without plastic they had to change treir live style .
Nowadays there are a lot of products which have plastic or they are wrapped in plastic so it could be difficult to live a whole month without it .
However this family believed that if they arrived their goal , they would reduce the amount of plastic rubbish .
So they would help to stop a bit the problem fot the UK 's recycling system .
This family says that they had to change their diet too , because of some of their usual food .
Such us yoghorts , biscuits , etc was wrapped in plastic .
So I think that from my point of view it could be difficult to follow this life style much more than a couple of months .
There are a lot of products or food , which are needed in our life , and they are match with plastic .
However I also think that it 's important to be concient with the environmental concernts , so some ideas like this could be good to reduce the rubbish .
To sum up I think that it 's important to know that we should recycle plastic as well as carton , glass , etc .
In order to do n't waste energy .
So we can use the plastic in a responsible way but we have to know that we should n't follow this idea until the extreme because we need plastic .
Sitting here alone , six floors up on my little balcony , when I heard shots and saw boys running .
The first thing I thought was that there was a CONFLICT between someone .
I watched till they DRAG him away , and then everything got quiet again as it there was nobody , so I 'm sure the cops will ENFORCE the guy who did this .
A couple 's coming slow on Frankstown with a girl by the hand , had to be the boy 's baby sister .
They pass through Mason 's bar and stop exactly next to the spot the boy died .
How do they know .
Then they started to put and REWARD flowers were the boy died .
How do these people find the spot .
Could they hear my old mind working to guide them , lead them and TREND them and get up out this damn wheelchair and take them by the hand .
But I was in POVERTY , so I could not go and take them .
The guy who killed that boy really need to have a INCENTIVE to kill him .
If there was a machine that can go REVERSE in the time , I might could save him .
But , unfortunately , were not in the future .
The other benefit of living abroad is an incredible personal experiences .
For example , you may meet someone who has travelled nonstop for 20 countries and visited most of the countries on the plants .
Therefore , this experience opens you up to different ways of viewing the world which may alter the rest of your life .In addition , it gives your children a much better understanding of other culture when they attend international schools .
This results in it will change their lives and expand their prospects in the future .
I hope you have had a high score at the school .
If you like mountain , you could start your travel on the North , a region called Asturias .
There are good meals and drinks : " fabada " ( with beans ) and " sidra " ( it looks apple juice ) .
Near the mountain ( about 20 kilometres ) you can find beaches , but I recommend the beaches on the South , Andalusia .
If you come here on February , you will enjoy a lot in Cadiz with the carnival .
If you come on Spring , you have to visit Seville , and you will enjoy the Easter Week and the Feria week .
You have many roads , motorways , so you can rent a car and travel by yourself , without table - fixed times .
Despite , if you dislike driving , you can use public transport : long distance trains , buses , etc .
At the end , to look for a job , I think the best option is Madrid , which is the capital city , and there you will find a job easily .
I hope you enjoy your travel and see you soon .
Not differently of much of the world sports lovers , I 'm sick about Football !
Not just a really competitive game ; Football is a full mix of art , creativity , dedication , hard work and team cooperation .
Even if you are the best player in the whole world , you have always to play for your team - or else , be ready to be overcame by your foe !
Sometimes , the real spectacle does n't take place in the fields , but in its surrounds !
Usually , when facing tough opponents or decisive matches , they turn the stadium in a really large party in order to intimidate the adversaries ; coloring the benches with flags and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaics to express their delight .
If someone asks me what is the most important thing to start practicing ( or even following ) this terrific sport , I 'd say it 's the passion in wearing your club 's jersey and the respect towards your adversaries ' .
For years of wars and difficult situations the history was creating people 's beliefs and convintions .
I think religion means a lot for people- especially polish people .
I want to describe a story of the Monastery of Częstochowa .
Its a city in Poland strongly connected with a dramatichistory of our country .
The icon , depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child , known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was imported from Russia in 1384.And since then a lot of pilgrims has been visiting that picture .
Some people probably think - there is not anything special- usual picture .
But in the 17th century there happened a miracle .
Polish people had to defend Częstochowa and rescue their countryBut the polish resistance was smaller and smaller .
In 1656 polish king John II Casmir made Lwów Oath .
He promised that the Madonna of Częstochowa will always be a polish queen .
When you were a child have you ever asked what are you able in ?
Athletes are extremely strong , probably they might fall in love with a sport at the first sight .
On one hand we have the people who lives on their sport , on the other hand there are ones who do any sport , indifferently , because it is just a way to lose weight or a way to spend their free time .
Unfortunately , I have not a favourite sport , although I 'd like to .
It is likely you would have got more self - confidence if you had worked harder during a course .
So , for the unlucky ones like me , my suggestion is If you did not fall in love with any sport , you should try a course ! You will surely feel better and more relaxed after that .
You can visit museums , roman monuments and also the cathedral .
It is an important city and there are a lot of attractions .
You can go by train , by bus o maybe to rent a car .
YOu could go to clubbing in Tarragona but if you travel in summer it is worth the effort go to Salou .
AT night has a special atmosphere .
Conclusions and recommendatios
Tarragona and surroundings are a good place to visit and to know their culture .
Everybody can be a good teacher for younger people .
First , Parents are a great source of experience which can be helpful in teaching .
Secondly , they have a close relationship with their children , which results by feelings and emotions .
As mentioned earlier , Experience is a prerequisite for every teacher .
In this respect , parents have so many things to teach to their children .
They have faced with different events in their lives and every event has had many lessons for them .
It does n't matter that they have failed or gained success on those events , the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events .
In this point of view , children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences .
I myself , have faced with so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents .
Once I was 18 years old , I had to make an important decision about my university major .
So I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities .
I was hoping that , my decision was the right one , but it was n't actually . I had chosen electronic but my parents told me to have some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronic .
I did their recommendations and I totally changed my idea .
There were some aspects that I was really unaware of them .
So by considering different ideas and opinions , finally I chose computer engineering as my university major .
So , Parents ' experiences can make them strong teachers for their children .
They are really close to their children in the terms of feelings and emotional matters .
They have a strong familiarity about favorites , skills , talents and all other valuable information related to their children .
So I came to my parents and asked their help , they presented the best recommendations for making the decision , then I could make the best friends that I can easily go along with .
I am really satisfied by my parents as my indisputable teachers .
they have really saved my lives in different cases .
So parents can be the best teachers regarding their emotional closeness to their children .
Also they have so many close relationships with their children , which makes them a trustworthy characters as teachers .
I hope a day that all the children rely on their parents as their teachers .
what I usually do in my free time .
I really like reading many kinds of books , magazine , etc.when the weather is bad , I love sitting in my favorite armchaire , near the fire place and reading .
I enioy to hear the rain while I am reading at home ...
Howhever I like very much walking too .
When the weather is good I often go out with my friend for a walk in the countryside or do shopping .
I also love watching films at the cinema or on tv .
I prefer comedy and romance , but I like triller and drama too .
At least I enioy to take care on my garden , where there are many flowerbeds with a lot of kinds of flowers .
I am glad to hear you and know you have bought a new computer game .
Actually I do n't like very much the computer games , because in my opinion they are so boring!I also think these games get a sort of dependency , like the alcohol or the drugs , so they can be very dangerous !
I really prefer doing other kind of things on my computer , like to surf the Internet , to study English , etc .
For example I use my computer to prepare exercises for my students or to look for funny and useful laboratory 's experiences of chemistry .
We like very much the sea , so we looked to rent a little cottage on August at a lovely place in Sardegna .
We arrived at the island in the morning , after a long journey on a ferryboat .
Then we got on a bus to arrive at the house which we had rented .
The cottage was really fine , with a fantastic view of the beach .
I looked forward to go on the beach and to swim in that wonderful wather .
But the lucky was n't with me !
In fact I was ill all the time and I only could look the sea through the window of my room !
I am always glad to receive your letter !
This is a documentary about the science .
I like watching it because in this programme I can get a lot of information .
For example I can know about the Big Bang , the origin of the universe , it 's fascinating !
I can also look about the astronomy , the fisic , the chemistry , the biology and many other range of the science .
In this programme I can have information about the last scientific discovery and the
technological development .
In my opinion it is one of the most interesting programme about the science on TV .
This is a job about all the information material on a cruse , and media manager works with other managers on a cruise .

Media manager follow information on panel , change information depending on weather , trip and many other information .
You can change all the information on a cruise and inform passengers about the plan change for the cruise .
We also have to take in mind taking care of our environment , in order to have a healthy life .
In my town we protect the Environment Around us :
By recycling , by tryng to reduce the transit , walking and cycling , that also impruves our health and fitness .
People from all eages must help to clean up the city and protect the wildlife .
At school , children had been tauhgt about how to do an apropiated use of the electric energy .
there are many people that offered themselves as volunteers to clean the city , and had been very helpful to make the city cleaner and more attractive .
There also a lot of plans for the futre , in order to start using electric cars .
" Seven " is a story about a psychopathic serial killer , who kills on behalf morality and ethics .
In particular , the killer kills seven people each one corresponding to those - that according to the Christian religion , are the seven deadly sins .
That provides , especially to one of the two detectives who are investigating about the crimes , a trace to follow in their investigation .
In the movies are some references to the Dante 's " Divina Commedia " Italian poem as well as to the Bible .
The film is excellent because of both a very exciting and engaging plot , and great interpretation of the main characters - the serial killer and the two detectives .
To my mind , shopping has both believers and opponents .
The first one claim that shopping is a big pleasure and fun .
In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable .
Many times when I was on shopping , I was unhappy or disappointed for different reasons .
First of all , we can like or even love shopping , but not always we have have enough money to buy items we want or need .
It 's nice go through shops and take leave with hands full of bags .
What is more , shopping may affect our mood or even body in a bad way .
When it comes to bargain sale , on such period people start to behave like animals and rarely think reasonable .
They walk very quickly , even run to get the last thing which is left on the store .
All in all , shopping in it 's intention is an enjoyable action which often makes us feel happy about it .
Nevertheless , some people treat shopping too seriously and as a result become addicted to it .

In the wonderful world of cooking that we live where we have a lot of products and chefs so good , I would want to visit an Italian restaurant because I love cheese and I think that Italy is the best place where you can eat a different types of cheese in the world .
The perfect atmosphere for me is a modern build that it has different rooms with different styles : modern , classic , gotic , etc .
When I eat in a restaurant I hate two things : people smoking and the high level of voice of the people .
Whereas , I love two things too : a friendly waitress with her traditional black clothes and a light on my table that make the night more romantic if you dinner with your couple or more relaxed if you dinner with your friend .
I think that an Italian restaurant is a great place for my class because there they can choose between different fantastic dishes for example : pasta , pizza , seafood or pork .
Besides , they can drink many wines .
However , not all it is ok , a trip to Italy is so expensive and many clasmates ca n't go it .
I enjoyed the time off from the University .
My time off from the University is significant to my personal development .
learning can also take place outside the University campus .
As such , we develop through interacting with their environment .
While on holidays from the University .
I travelled to my country of birth where I was able to meet my family member , relative and friends .
I was able to inspire some members of my family to send their children to University .
I told my friends and family members the importance of University Education to our community .
I visited many interesting places i.e. nature reserve , historical places , zoo , rivers etc .
Also during this period , I was involved in a local community project to build community hospital . while on this project , I interact and shared ideas with other professionals on the project .
While on the time off from the University .
I took a part - time employment with the local housing company .
This part - time job gives me the learning opportunity to develop my skills and understand the practical aspect of my career .
I enjoyed the monetary values of this job .
I earn some money to pay my University fee and rent for three months . I also received a very good reference from the firm which was passed on to the University .
They would like to offer me another opportunity for work placement on my final year at the University .
I live in Milan with my parents but I 'll move to the USA before the end of spring so I would like to find a job there to make some money .
My parents are both English native speakers but to learn more about the culture I studied languages at the university and now I 'm graduated in English and French so this job is also an opportunity for me to improve my English in another state and not only with my parents and family .
In Italy I worked as a babysitter for a couple of months , I took care of 3 kids : 1 child is 7 years old and the others 2 children are both 11 years old and back then I had to cook for them lunch and dinner .
At the university I was part of the football team and we won the championship against one of the most athletic football team in our country .
I think I 'm an energetic person , that likes all the types of sports and activities but the most important thing is that I love kids and playing with them makes me really happy .
I would like to take part of your staff so please let me know if I can work with you !
The convenience of travelling by cars benefits the majorities of us in a modern society .
Car manufactures desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of a car .
By making it more modern , powerful and economic , they have successfully attracted more customers than ever .
In Canada , the vehicles per capita is 60.7% in 2001[1 ] .
There was once an interest saying that North America are the nations on wheels .
Car has brought the epic change to our lifestyle .
We depend on cars so much as if they are our spare pair of foot .
As result , the rapid increasing of cars on the road brought negative consequences .
Firstly , vehicle 's emissions can cause detrimental effects on the environment in many ways .
In most cases , these fluids are toxic to humans and animals , and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed incorrectly .
In addition , traffic congestion has become another worsen problem .
It spread massively in much of the world and has many negative impacts of all aspects .
In 2010 , a recurring massive traffic jam that happened in China caught worldwide media 's attention .
The traffic Jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days .
Its comfortable , efficient and economic features have been attracting more young professional .
By taking a subway , you will be able to guarantee your arrival time for a class or an important meeting ; In some big cities , public transport plays a big role in a modern society . with great coverages and efficient routes ,
subway has become the most popular commute tool .
For instance , in New York , the subway system contains 232 miles of routes .
In 2013 , the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides , averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2 ] Shanghai Metro system are 14 metro lines and 329 stations , with an operating route length of 334 miles , with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013 .
On a normal weekday over 8 million people use the Shanghai Metro.[3 ]
In addition to the convenience of public transport , the fare is much cheaper compare of driving a car .
Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport pass as a benefit .
Even though our subway system is still developing , the main line that pass through downtown , several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourist , students and professionals 's prior choice for commute .
There are some park and ride stations allowed car drivers to connect with the subway , It is very convenient and encouraged more people to drive less .
If I have to get to somewhere on time in rush hour , I will first consider the subway over drive a car .
Eco - friendly awareness has positively affected young generations .
Taking subway to work has become a trend and all the changes that happening today will sure lead a bright future to public transport .
I know you 're coming next week to Rome and I would be really glad if you could come to see me .
First of all , once you arrive you will need to get the train , which stops at Tiburtina .
From there take the bus 45 and stop at Piazza Rubiani , I 'm do n't live very far from there , it will only take a couple of minutes .
So , from Piazza Rubiani take the second on the right which Via Priscilla and stop at number 27 .
I think it could be a good idea to try the restaurant " The old clock " .
It 's an ancient brewery which keeps a particular atmosphere .
The menu in not really wide - this is good in my opinion , because I 'm quite suspicious of the restaurants offering too many dishes ... The restaurant serves fresh food only , depending on the season 's products .
There is also a good choice of food for vegetarians , so Mike and Ann will have not a problem to eat .
The downside could be the waiting time to eat , because all the dishes are prepared at the time of the customers do the order .
But it 's a guarantee for the client : the food is great indeed !
The location is informal and the service is good , the owner and the waiters are friendly , you feel at home .
You can listen live music or a DJ on Friday evening , it 's really fun !
Last but not least , the price is good , especially compared with the quality of food and service .
I opened it and I could see a common C D inside .
When I got home , I played the CD on the CD player but it really was n't any sound !
At that moment the phone started to ring , I pick it up ... but no one answeared me when I asked ' Who is that ? ' .
I was beginning to get very nervous when somebody Knocked the door .
Suddenly a loud noise was heard in the room and I woke up .
I was lying on the couch with a mystery novel in my hands!. It had all been just a nightmare!.
What to you feel are the main causes of this ?
Obesity is one of the most important challenges of the current society due to the fact that people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly .
This essay will look at the some of the key causes and effects of overweight among people .
Firstly , food habits such as fast food and sedentary lifestyle are some of the main causes of surge in weight among people .
For instance , there are many studies by various bodies in the US show that more and more teenagers are spending most of their time in front of TV or computer playing video games , they hardly perform any sort of physical activity and also indulge in fast food .
This shows that fried or package food and complete lack of exercise are the chief reasons for increase in obesity among young people .
Secondly , bullying among teenagers and rise in heart attacks are some of the main effects among people who are obese .
For example , it should be noted that , recent studies by WHO has revealed that obese people are prone to bullying and there is rise in number of cases of heart attacks among young people with obesity .
This example shows that people with obesity not only suffer from bullying but also from heart attacks .
Having looked at both causes and effects of overweight among people , it is recommended that people take care of eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a health lifestyle for their own benefit .
How are your things ? I went to our new shopping centre last week .
I spent a really good time with my boyfriend , this place is outside the city centre of Granada , in Spain .
I liked this shopping centre because it has a lot of women 's shops inside , the facilities are quite atracctive and very up - to - day , the green zones are wide and it is supplied with a lot of wooden benches .
I bought two kinds of clothes , casual clothes for every day and outfit for an occasion to my cousin 's wedding the next month .
See you soon ¡
He had been stuck in this blizzard for a lot of time .
He did n't know what to do , he tried to call someone , but the line did n't work .
He was starting to get nervous , he was arriving late to his sister 's wedding , it was probably the best day of her life and he was n't there with her .
When the first hour had passed he decided he would go walking .
When he opened the door a cold wind whipped him hard but he did n't care about it and kept going .
The sky was cloudy , the temperature was below zero , the wind made him not being able to walk and it 's now when he realized why was her sister celebrating her wedding on these dates .
He could n't believe it , but he could n't stop walking he had to get to church .
Peter opened the door and everybody turned around to watch him .
He was wet , cold , starving and outside the weather had worsened , the road was flooded and the cars could n't pass .
For me , these are the most incredible sports that anyone can perform .
Swimming is one of the most complete sports because you use every part of your body in order to sustain and advance the water .
The ideal is to start practicing this sport as children , because the oldest you are is more difficult to overcome fear , but it is never too late to learn to swim .
This sport combines the movement of arms and legs with breathing , as coordination between these parties is crucial .
2 . burn more calories , because in the water , the muscles work 5 times more than on outside it .
4 . Eliminate back pain and bones .
5 . Relax not only the body but also the mind , so that the stress decreases considerably .
If you want to know more and learn to practice this sport , we recommend attending a specialized school , there are many good and not so expensive , where you can count with the support of a qualified instructor who will give you the confidence to start .
As per our discussion earlier on the Service Guide Sales communication , I would like to ask you if you already have started to prepare the background and sales communication materials for having these service guide and how to use them .

Following our communication to the marketing community , ideally we should also inform the sales community with the sales communication materials and guidelines .
I propose to have a meeting to discuss the process / timeline and align our communications to the marketing and sales community .

You welcome , I 'll be very happy to put you up . I'll show you the marvellous venues which are situated in my hometown .
To coming to my accommodation , firstly you must take the National Express ' coach .
Secondly you 'll get off at the Galleria .
On the opposite side of National express ' bus stop there 's the bus stop .
You have to catch 712 bus up .
It brings you directly to my subburn .
Finally you will find my apartment near the bus stop .
About the weather forecast for next month , I 'm afraid to tell you that the temperature might fall down .
I suggest having a coat .
If you need further details how to arrive at my apartment write to me soon .
As you do not have to wait for set time tables and follow fixed routes .
You can go anywhere you want and even during the night when the public transport is scarce or it could be unsafe .
Driving your own car gives you more freedom in travelling and increases your sense of independence .
However , a car is not always more economical to run because for example , you have to pay road taxes , insurance , and motor tests .
Not to mention the combustible .
Generally speaking , cars generates more pollution than any public transport .
The main reason of this , is that cars use diesel or petrol , whereas trains use electricity .
It is also important to mention that people who drives its own car most the time travel on their own .
Finally , another advantage over private cars is that it reduced the traffic chaos .
To sum up , I think the future in transport is just starting up .
From 17th to 20th March me and my schoolmates , and also the 2 M , went to a trip to Sicily .
We stayed here for 4 days and we visited Taormina , Siracusa , Agrigento , Marsala and a little part of Trapani .
We flew from Orio Al Serio to Catania : to me was the first time I took an air , and it was amazing , but at the beginning I had a little bit of headache .
When we arrived in Catania the bus driver bring us in a café to have breakfast .
Then we went to Taormina and we visited a lot of things : the Greek theatre , Corvaia palace and the Sicilian ' pupi ' , Roman Odeon and a public garden and other beautiful places .
In the evening we went to Siracusa and we stayed in the hotel because we were tired .
The next morning we visited Siracusa and in the afternoon we went to Ortigia island where we had a little bit of free time .
From Siracusa we moved to Agrigento where a lot of us stay in the hotel that night .
In Garigento we saw the ' Valle Dei templi ' and a museum and in the afternoon we moved to ' Santa Maria Dei Greci ' .
We saw also Pirandell 's house , and after this we went to Marsala . during the evening we stayed in the hotel and in the morning we saw a museum and then we moved to Trapani where we visited the saltworks .
Then we had free time for 1 hour , but soon we had to go to the airport to take the air and come back here .
Besides , my car is considerably powerful than other means of transport .
It does not need a fuel because there are different forces which raise the car in the air .
My transport is blue like the sky .
Using this transport I will go to New Zeland then Australia and other countries .
I want to see tropical animals , birds and meet with local population .
Besides , I am going to look migration of the biggest animals of the world - whales .
Travelling by car is muc more convenient , as many people say , but public transport is much better for the environment .
There are now 8 billion people living on our earth and if everyone would drive a car , the smoke would be so high , that we could n't live here anymore .
There would be much more exhaust if every person is driving a car .
Public transport will increase in the future , because every year there are more trainstations , and more streets .
It unravels in the modern New York among anonymous office buildings and empty - eyed crowds .
The hero finds all his friends disappear one by one .
Only by looking in the eyes of the stone - cold danger can he evade the disappearance himself .
It is an individual but also team activity .
In my opinion it is one of the healthiest sport there are beacuse you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breath .
I do not practice swimming in competitions but almost since I was 3 years old .
I always had great coaches who trained me according to my ability so that I did not go never over my limit .
During these years I have changed three times around pools .
At the moment I am training at the Turin Sisport near Mirafiori .
Is a sport quite tiring but you can relax when the coach says it 's time to take a break .
If I had to give advice to someone who wants starting this sport I would tell him not to worry if he does n't feel confident .
If he was afraid of the water it is not recommended to practice this sport , or be able to break down his fear would be a great goal .
All in all I would recommend to anyone to play this sport .
If we talk about my favourite sport , basketball will be .
I like basketball because it is one of the easiest sport .
I think playing basketball help me to be healthy .
If someone wants to play some sport , basketball is my first advice .
It is an easy sport to play for anyone who never play any sport before .
These are the story about basketball , my favourite sport .
Neither do I. However , I have a curious opinion .
On the one hand , your relatives are the people who will be always part of you .
Nobody can leave a family as there will be a bloody union .
It is more possible losing contact with a friend than with the family .
Otherwise , it happens that sometimes you have an argument with a family member and you need to talk to a friend to be cheered up .
If you talk to a friend , who is also a member of your family , the situation could turn out to be a little awkward .
All in all , how we can see there are many advantages and disadvantages of considering the members of your family your best friends .
From my point of view , friendship is based on the honesty .
What 's more , not only is your best friend the person who never lies you , but also is the person who is always by your side .
If a family member was like that , it could turn into my best friend .
The purpose of this report is to evaluate the range of options available for many twenty - somethings in order to choose their housing system in my country , as well as the main obstacles they face with each one .
Moreover , it will also describe the possible housing outlook in the next years and the consequences for young people .
Nowadays owning your own house has become an uphill struggle unless you were willing to pay through the nose for it .
Due to the enormous economic crisis that have shaken Europe and that have intoxicated the real - estate market , most of the prices are eye - watering expensive for college students that want to study abroad or simply emancipate .
Even if they manage to save the amount of money for a flat it usually has not enough room to swing a cat .
In addition the unwillingness of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something important to take into account .
Although renting is the first option for most of the youth , rents also had been affected for the housing bubble and their prices have shot up too .
Then , sharing the costs could be the solution for lots of students beyond all the problems that could arise from the communal living .
In order to save up for future plans , a large number of early adults prefer to stay under the wing of parents rather than leaping in the dark and go out .
That could be end in constant arguments because of issues like intimacy and so on .
The future remains uncertain until the economic situation gets over .
As there are no many signs for this to become real , young people must wait to start their own lives .
It keeps me fit , be healthy and full of energy .
When I run I feel relaxed , I forgot all my troubles and stresses .
It refreshed me .
Once , I took part in half - marathon .
At first , I could n't believe that I can do this .
In addition , I met new friends here , they are very clever and physically strong .
I keep practicing with them running around West Lake every Saturday .
After the race we get around in the cafe , drink beer and have a nice conversation .
My next goal is to participate in full - marathon .
Also running improves my willpower , because I have to wake up early in the morning and run , without fail .
I become more organized , and I managed to do more than I could imagined .
I think everything is possible when you are organized . You start to build your own timetable , which make your life more easy and effective .
This company has the intention of setting up some training courses for staff so I came up with the idea of having a course that concentrates on company morale .
I strongly believe in the idea of having a comfortable office environment , because when you like what you are doing and also where you doing it , you will do it the best you can .
I recommend that everyone at this department take the course , that way we could have the perception of all the employees and focus in what we need to improve and canalize it into profits .
This courses will last about a week and I suggest we only take from two to three hours per day so it does n't become tedious and we can keep everyone interested .
In conclusion this will get everyone feel part of the company and have everyone 's opinions .
yesterday , I watched a science fiction movie called blade runner .
The movie was first released in 1982 and directed by Ridley Scott who is the director of Alien .
The story of blade runner is about a police officer named dickard who is working as a killer for the most dangerous robots on earth which they called the replicants , and they are dangerous on human .
The film events happened in Los Angels in late 2019 , there are 4 robots in the story and each robot has his own character , and the most famous and dangerous one is called batty , he is a very advanced robot and has many skills and abilities .
Dickard the police officer killed three robots in the film , but at the end of the movie and before he tried to kill the last robot , he discovered that batty has emotions and feelings instead of his mechanism body because he saved dickard 's life at the end of the film .
Travelling has an important role in our everyday life , we need to get to work , school , want to meet our friends .
Most of those plans would not be possible , if there were not for means of transport .
But which one , public transport or our own car we will be choosing more often in future ?
On the one hand it is more convenient to have a car .
Owning vechicle is very comfortable and gives you independence .
It enable you to go everywhere you want no matter when .
You can also stop caring about how much you taking to work and on trips , being able to hide all those things inside of your trunk while it is impossible in any other means of transport ,
On the other hand , having your own car is expensive and no everyone could afford it .
For those people there is always another option - public transport .
It is not only cheaper , but also saves you from such problems as lack of parking places and reduce traffic jams .
Moreover , travelling by trains , trams or buses produces less exhaust fumes and as a result saves ozone layer .
To sum up , travelling using public transport is more beneficial for both environment and travellers .
I am convinced , that in spite of comfortable cars , public transport will be constantly developing .
Yes , I know , it was a difficult decision to take , but I am too stressed here , I need a break , so I decided to travel to England , the country I have ever wanted to visit but I 've never been there .
For this the first think I 'd like to do when I 'll arrive is to visit the country , I want to do this during the first month , every day I want to enjoy myself visiting new places !
After I 'll need to make some money , my parents will give me some but they wo n't be enough for six months , so I must find a job !
I need to ask you for some help , you 're the only person I know who lives there , so the only one who can help me .
The first thing I must ask you is if you could find a place where I can stay , a motel or , better , a shared house . I know it 's a lot to ask but could you send me a contact of a company that is looking for a part - time staff ?
They can also treat or prevent a disease or condition , and are used by the scientists in researches , and by the doctors .
I think it is a really good idea to use the stem cells in order to save other people 's lives , even if they come from an abroted foetus .
There are a lot of people in this world that are ill and need stem cells in their healing process , so parents that had an abroted foetus should let the scientists and the doctors use the stem cells in their research , and help other people .
Science nowadays developed a lot , and gave the population a lot of possibilities like storing the stem cells and using them to heal the future health problems anyone could have .
All in all , I suppose a lot of people disagree with this subject because it is not a good idea for them , but in my opinion it is a really good idea to save other people 's lives by taking stem cells from an aborted foetus .

In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable , especially for men .
When the women spend the hours in the shops , men must go with them .
It 's a suffering for every man .
First , they have to spend the many and waste time witch they could spend watching TV .
Shopping is not enjoyable also , when we must buy something , in this case we ca n't find what we want , generally , people do n't like the things which they have to do .
In this situation , we are nerves and stress .
Sometimes , your shopping turn out to be unsuccessful and you are desperate because you wasted money .
But , if you are woman and you are lots of money and time you will be always content during the shopping .
If we think about them , we would realize that we are lucky because of the simple fact of enjoy them .
One of the momentous human aims is to make eternal the life as much as it could be possible .
Nowadays , we have a lot of electronic devices such as microwaves , remote contols for tv , electronic devices for cooking , personal computers , and so on and so forth .
Each one make the everyday life a bit more easy , but a real progress on home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind .
An inner electronic system would compose the whole house ; it would include small devices of wave reception connected , in every side of house , to a gum headband whose function would be to identify the neuronal stimuli and to convert them on radiowaves .
This headband would be related to household chores such that if you would need to washing dishes or to sweeping , you only may to think about it and the robotized system of the house would send orders to each part of the house itself .
This system would also be connected to the Internet in a ' dual output port remote of information ' .
Having explained it , I am completely sure that this outline of my ' house of future ' will astonish and marvel everyone who read my sublime project .
How are you donig ? I remember you wanted me to tell you about my experience with helping at a concert I 've been to last month .
I am glad to tell you that it was awesome and I hope that I will be able to do something like that again . I am convinced that it was one of the best days in my life .
It all started when I applied for being a volunteer at this event .
I did n't think that I have any chance to get there , because of the big amount of rivals .
But I fortunately did it .
I attached to a group of people who were responsible for informing public about the programme and all the organisation stuff .
There were so many guests and I was afraid that it will be too hard for me to do it right .
But my new friends from this group were very polite and we worked together , so it was much easier , than I thought at first .
After some time I felt sad , because I realised that I wo n't be albe to see the bend playing at the stage , because I had to stay in front of the entry .
But after the first song , when the audience started to sing and dance , our manager came to us and told us that we can go see the concert .
I was having a great time through the entire concert .
After that we went to the backstage and spent some time with the band .
We took some pohotos and got autographs .
I hope that next time you will be able to go with me .
Michael do n't know anything about love and sweetness .
The only thing he knew when he came to Mandy 's home was this : The world does n't turn around him .
He came and the first word he said was :

And Michael do n't care what people think about him .

And that was how Michael was at this moment .

You 're always like that .
He taking his bag and he goes to the door .

But , considering the increase in private vehicles in our crowdly populated world , it is recommended by geologists and eco - scientists that we use public transportation .
By this way , we not only contribute to saving our eco - system , we also contribute to increasing the national revenue .
When mobile phones have conquered our palms , we have no time to even meet our parents and children .
Our interaction with human beings have pathetically reduced .
Cars are mostly used by people travelling for long distances in shorter time .
Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely , but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with our people .
They are safer , cheaper and faster .
Even if cars outnumber users , public transport will continue to help and support us in a safe and a healthy living .
For centuries the population of the world has been dreamt of commuting anywhere comfortably by car .
How many of us stand from our bed already exhausted from the only thought of getting into a public transport ?
It was thinking about this major problem that , the governments from around the world has launched the greatest and ambitious plan .
To start with cars are going to be made by using the high technology at lower cost , therefore affordable to all .
New motorways , streets , parking are not longer sit on the council 's offices , waiting to be signed , they are reality transforming the world landscape .
Could we ever think of such dream coming true ? All this is beyond my imagination and understanding , whereas the use of new technologies could be used to give the world a much better healthy environment and less egocentric .
I am very interested in to start a pet - care franchise because I like pets and I think all these services would be very helpful for a lot of people in my country too .
Can you tell me more about the possibilities of taking out a Petpals franchise in my country .
I would like to know with how many initial investment I have to calculate ?
How many hours do you work in this business and when are the working hours ?
Another thing I would like to know is how much turnover / profit can I expect in the first year ?
In your article you write from a education center with assistance for new franchisees .
Which training do you offer ?
Can you send me an offer ?
Thank you very much for you help .
We'll get lonely more and more and also selfish , too .
Everyone will get help from the machines or technological items .
Technology will be our best friends .
Despite this our appearance will change .Our fashion will be more technique .
Just for saving time ?
What about the relationship ?
Well , I do n't think that we will build a close relationship with anyone and building a family will be even worse .
The family might exist on paper but not in real because each member in the family will be busy and they will just send some masseges from the high technology phones they 'll have at that time .
I know , it sounds boring and pessimistic but if we wo n't change our minds imediately , the future is going to be like that , for sure .
This bar chart depicts an average of knowledge on reading and writing for female and male on six different regions in 2000 .
From an overall perspective it is notable a higher amount of illiterate women in all the regions compared with men , who are in some cases the half part of the total of women in each region .
Developed countries , Latin America and East Asia are the three regions that depict a low percentage of illiterate people , expresed below 20% , whereas Sub - Saharan Africa , Arab States and South Asia are above 30% of people who do not know read and write .
Developed countries figures are the lowest , being almost at 1% , whilst South Asia numbers rose extremely , reaching almost a 60% in the case of female gender and overtaking the 30% in the male gender .
As we can see , an unequal percentage are shown depending on the area where the people come from .
Buenos Aires is a city made for tourists , visitors can do so many activities in a small radio of the city , dance Tango , eat traditional meet or visit a beautiful library are some of them .
Furthermore there are many places where tourist can buy many things , such as a typical mate or a picture from the obelisco porteño .
But if visitors want something more than a typical souvenir , they can visit canteens or a bar where are set tango shows and take they own pictures or even buy a CD with the traditional music from Buenos Aires .
There are also places where peolpe can buy the typical clothes , dark dresses for women or a ' tango hat ' for man .
Even if you want just go shopping for clothes , there are so many places where you can go , Palermo is known as a little New York for the disigners and well know marks , and technology is set on Recoleta .
So , Buenos Aires , also know as the Paris from America , gives all visitors the opportunity for meeting Argentinian tradition in only one city that involves the history and the culture of the country .
Pontevedra in its way to become a green town .
Pontevedra has been one of the most polluted towns from Galicia for many years .
We had two factories and a great amount of traffic problems .
We did not even knew what to do with our garbage .
First of all , let me tell you there has been a great change in people 's minds .
We thought the factories were good because they allowed a great amount of people to work there .
At the beginning , this was a much controversial decision .
Later , he also ordered to clean our wet zones too .
Finally , he has championed moving Celulosas factory to a safer place .
We have suffered like every other city these rough years .
We want to move away the last factory from the river .
In many countries , it 's consider that the relatives are the close family and the only people with an individual can be just the way he is .
This point of view is based on , for example , that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
Maybe , most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages .
It 's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family , because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on , despite not always it 's true .
I should talk in the third person because I do n't have any brothers or sisters , but a close cousins .
For example , the debate about the statement that you can not choose your family , but your friends .
Thus , it fits perfect for those people who have a bad relation with their families .
They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people with whom they can trust .
In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family , like envy , refuse or hate .
Even , if you look for a good advice , some members of your family could help you from the heart .
But , family not always guarantees these functions neither friends .
However , friends can be as a family and fulfil all this functions , too .
Therefore , I only would like to remark that family not means relatives , but those people with whom you can feel as at home .
That is , in any place suddenly you can find someone who could become in your most close relative .
I decided to take one class of Liceo Oberdan to visit a Miramare harbor reserve .
It is a lovely place not far from our school , and I think it 's interesting in his natural habitat .
I decided to do this , in according to the biology teacher .
During this year she had explained the harbor world , in particular the world of Miramare , and I describe the same things under the geography aspects .
I was just a bit worried because in this class there are 28 students , but they are very respectful and clever .
We took the local bus and we arrived at ten in this place .
Here we found some very expert guides who takes us in a good touring along the park and the harbor reserve .
Every students were interested in the information and they asked a lot of explanations .
In this day the students had the oppportunity to hear very interesting things , but not as they were in a class during a traditional frontal lesson .
They had improved their knowledge making experience in the field .
I think that the students will not forget very soon what they have learned .
In recent years , whether using internet is beneficial or not has never failed to attract people 's attention .
While many people believe that internet brings a vast amount of problems such as reduction of interaction between people and some bad information resources ; in contrast , I have a strong position that internet brings manyfold benefit than drawbacks .
People should first recognize that searching information these days is much more convenient than in the past .
We must come to library to pay a lot of time finding information we need on the shelves the earlier time .
On the other hand , we can assess the information with only a click button nowadays .
Clearly , the assessment become much more efficiently with computer and internet .
Yet , perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using internet is that the vast amount of information contended in it .
Admittedly , some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough , it still offers us many other useful sources .
Simultaneously , some sources contended pornography and violent information which make many people afraid of using internet to search information .
Nevertheless , it remains a good way to reserve and supply information which hoped to have more flows in the future .
I think , one of the important historical places in Japan is the Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto .
It is well - known with a great beautiful Buddhist temple in Japan and it 's also famous among foreigner .
Kiyomizu temple was built in the middle of Edo era .
It has five stairs and one of the tallest historical building in Kyoto .
It is a great and famous sightseeing place and it also is an important place of Japanese culture .
Kiyomizu temple was used many times as a background of a lot of Japanese novels , paints and historical dramas .
Artists think the top of the temple is good for making beautiful , nervous mood of stories or paints .
Also , the temple became a Japanese proverb which is " feel like falling from the top of Kiyomizu " .
It means " very scared and nervous " because the temple is very tall and it makes people such a feeling .
I would recommend one of the most appealing scope , which is situated in really attractive part of my city .
Starting with The Blue Palace you can visit some other old buildings .

In the last ten years , Brazil has created a wide range of governamental programmes .
Educational and medical assistance , as well as infraestructure improvements are some of the recent advancement .

As a consequence of this investment , the state is contributing to the improvement in the career of Brazilian professionals .

He did n't mention it is a horror movie .
When I watched until the middle of the film , it is scary .
But I could n't find the remote control , I could n't switch off the TV and I watched the whole film .
I went to bed and sleep .
There were a lot of ancient things such as clocks , cars , weapons .
And shoot all down .

I think it 's very interesting discover how foreign people usually eat .
It is another way to discover one culture .
Italians to start the day generally they have a strong coffee and some biscuit or slide bread .
It 's typical eating pasta as a starter at lunch .
Which is cooked in different ways .
It is common having meat as a main course .
To finish the lunch in Italy we eat fruit .
In my country we have a dinner late as a habit .
It 's more common eat pizza .
We have it as take away or we go in some pizzeria .

Have you ever been worried when you do n't have enough time to study in the day ?
Well here , there are some advice or ideas that have worked for me .
Do n't forget to recognise the most activities and tasks for you .
It 's very important , because if you do n't do that , so it 'll never work .
You have to put a time to do your tasks .
For instance , when you stay at university class or something like that , you should remember how much time you have to do it .
Finally , it depends on that works for you , because you have to be constantly remembering the time that you do your tasks .
It was late night and Michael went surrounded with deep dark to the edge of the forest .
The visibility was very poor because the moon was hiding behind dark grey shadows , but Michael went on the memory .
Suddenly , a thumledown cottage emerged from the darkness .
Michael up two little steps and heard wail of the wind .
He felt a range and a fear of disclosure . " Why is she singing ?
The Nazis can be everywhere , " he thought and unlocked the door with a little key .
" Stop with the singing !
" he whispered , " someone can hear it . "
Then he calm down and took a little packet out of his pocket and put it on the floor .
On the other hand , she was related to him by blood and how could he said No ! when she came and bagged him for help .
He entered decided that he will stay over the night .
well since my chillhood I always love weapons , my father gave me my first rifle when I was 7 , but it was until I was 15 when I found my real passion , and it was the archery , since that day I am proud to say that I am an archer , and that the archery is my favorite sport .
I just love when you take your bow and prepare to shoot an arrow , and before shooting it your are part of the bow , and you feel that the bow is a part of your body , after that , when you shoot the arrow you are able to see the curve that it makes before hitting the target , I would say this is why I love this sport and why I enjoy it so much .
if I would have the opportunity of giving some advice to a person that is starting in this sport , I would tell him to do not give up , because this ai nt an easy sport , and that is more mental than physical
One of the most beautiful place that you can visit in this town is The Latin - Catholic - Dom , located in Unirii Square .
I should present a little bit of history of it .
After more than seven hundred years , in 1733 , the latin - catholic bishops residence was moved from Cenad to Timisoara , where the first cathedral became the church of jesuists monks .
The design of the actual Dom was realized in baroque style of Vienna .
The cathedral hasa height of 55 m. The Dom was rise at rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756.What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk .
The visitors programme is from Monday to Sunday , from ten o'clock a.m to six p.m. And a phone number where you can call for more information is 0040212345678 .
PEOPLE LIVES WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS .
This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages that we will find the next 50 years .
It will consider some relevant items which will be completely changed in the future , as well as arguing and explaining the pros and cons of everything .
First of all , one of the biggest changes in a medium term will be the transport .
Roads transport will die away as you know it nowadays .
Instead of it , imaginary road network will be built in our air space .
Furthermore , environment will suffer the terrible effects of current lifestyle .
Consequently , protected clothes , which will be made with materials and NASA technology , will be worn by future population .
This will be so because of the pollution , the radiation existent and the increase of global warning .
On the other hand , the benefits of healthy will be important .
In fact , the development of different vaccines would be possible to get over a great deal of diseases .
To sum up , it is vital that nowadays thinking of our future .
If we develop our different knowledge areas , we will achieve a better world .
My idol was , is and will always be Justin Bieber .
I remember the first time that I saw his videos , I did n't write his last name correctly and I could n't find him on YouTube .
He was always talking about follow your dreams and never give up .
In 2014 I met a couple from One Direction called Larry Stylinson but they ca n't " come out " because of his managers .
I admire them because no matter what their managers make them go through , they always find the way to show us how much they love each other and how much they want to be free .
I really hope this " hiatus " , this is how they called their break , they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends , managers or the media around them .
Famous people live completely in a different way than unpopular people .
It is believed they are extraordinary , perfectly beautiful and incredible happy like we see their in magazines and TV .
Everybody longs to be a well - known and admired person leading rich and carefree life .
Unfortunately , truly it is n't so amazing like it seems to be .
There are a lot of disadvantages of being a star , of witch normal people do n't realised for example not having a private life .
There are a lot of various viewpoints and I would like to consider them .
Famous people haven't got private life .
Almost every their mystery come out and they are still judged , criticised or joked .
Journalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance ath the cost of them .
Everybody makes mistakes , but their mistakes are wtitten and known by the society , what is unfair and harmful .
They deserve to have a normal life , have mysteries , a moment of peace without interest around them .
Being all the time in a centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming .
That is why a lot of big name suffer from depression or even try take their life .
On the other side , there is a price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this .
They got so lot compared with unpopular people , that 's why I think it would be unfair , if they have also private life .
People can not have everything and live like they want .
They ought to apprecciate what they have and stop complaining aboout their life , because there is plenty of people , who dream to be them .
They have not got expensive cars , detached houses , they ca n't afford travelling and their only entertainment is watching TV .
They should remember they are lucky devils not like they often think - victim .
To sum up , It is hard to simply claim , that famous people deserve have a private life and being left alone by paparazzi or not .
Everyone from time to time need a moment of peace to relaxed and recover their strength .
However , nobody has everything they dreamed ; it is normal , that always in our lives something would be annoy us .
Famous people have to notice , how much they have , apprecciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life , because it is not such a disaster like they often think .
Day by day , the power of consumption increases more and more and one of the areas you can realize this is in the traffic .
People who have facilities to buy or finance something and looking for convenience , have a great desire to buy a car .
The bad quality of public transportation and the lack of options like underground and train , helps people choose to use a car .
These things makes we think if the public transport has a future , after all to do all the things you need in your routine like to go to work , to go shopping or just to go out with the family , is more comfortable by car than by bus .
Cars nowadays have technology that allow both drivers and passengers to have a better travel while listening to a music or use the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey .
The government needs to invest in better conditions of the public transport , with more options to the transportation of citizens , in order to make it easier to go from a place to another , and hardest the decision to choose between car or bus .
People have been debated about whether private car or public transport is the first choice in recent years .
As a result , they offer low fee and play an important role in the environment protection .
It was reported that for one hundred kilometers running , each car was consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline , and released a certain proportion of air polutted .
Meanwhile , with the same amount of energy , bus carried fifties of people , and even up to as high as hundreds of people with the massed transportation .
Secondly , it could not be denied that travelling by car is convenient , however people who agreed with the idea point out that high quality and modern public transport such as Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable .
can also satisfy passengers who could not travel by plane and require to take long haut jouneys .
There are some places in developing countries , for example in remote or highland areas , people have not seen a car for many years , they have no choice except old buses to travel .
In conclusion , public transportation is still the first choice of people in the future .
Nowadays higher education becomes more and more necessary for starting a good career .
There are some similarities ; however , differences in the educational system cause differences in the attitudes to education .
In general most of employers prefer applicants which achieved an academic degree .
During our last English lesson we talked about the future for public transport .
If you want to buy some vegetables for your dinner you will have to wait until the next train arrives at your station .
So in the near future there will be no longer a use for public transport .
After only three years he passed on Benetton formula one team and two years after he won his first driver championship .
After won another title he signed a contract with Ferrari team .
At that point his work become very hard and stressful because at that time Ferrari was n't a very good car in fact that car was only able to go fast in a straight circuits .
Michael showed up his strength and his attention to details working close days and nights with his engineers .
Three years later after intense work Michael restarted to put his feet on the podium .
In 2000 he won his third driver championship with Ferrari and also won it consecutively for three years .
Then Ferrari with Michael decided for a new collaboration , so the greatest become a test driver tried to improve the car out of the racers .
In the meantime his mind always thought at Mercedes because of his youngest dreams .
Like every German , since he was a young driver , dreamed being a driver championship with the national car .
To summarize he arranged a meeting with the head of Ferrari and the media press because he would like to announce his defenitively
This unfortunately was only an excuse he was only pretending to retired as he already signed a contract to drive Mercedes .
At the end of the conference Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
So many people around me think that makes not any sense spending community taxes in public transport .
These persons usually give arguments such as that the public transport is never in time , or that is difficult to get your destination using it and without having to take 3 different routes or even that public transport is not as suitable for a made up short notice trip as can be a car in property .
In my opinion these arguments depend on how efficiently designed is the public transport system , having in count number of routes , timetables , cost of the tickets and facilities for users who use it frequently .
It 's quite well known the benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community : an important reduction of contaminant gases , a hight decrease of acoustic contamination as well as , as consequence of having less cars circulating by our streets , an increase of pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking , running or cycling .
All these benefits surely will contribute to a better future for all the habitants so let 's give a chance to the public transport .
The city began to take care of the environment only in the last ten years when the studies created technologies for not produce pollution .
In this area there are many fields where were built wind turbine for use the wind and creating electric energy .
In the roof of the supermarkets are situated solar panels and it exploit the sun for produce energy .
This means of renewable energy are better than the old methods because they do n't pollute .
All surfaces are used in the better way possible .
There are many green parks where you can do sport and other activity without pollution .
The cars are n't use more because there are many places where you can rent the bicycle and naturally it is free .
During the winter the means of transport is efficient and not very expensive so the people can do n't use their car .
The text discusses about some kinds of Asian Bamboo that have a unique form of flowering and seeding cycle , these cycles just happen at long intervals and all the members of the species tend to flower and then seed at the same time .
And if we consider the speech where the woman said that at the present this phenomenon is a problem because this bamboo is the main source of food to the Giant Panda that still lives in the jungle .
the Giant Panda is an endangered specie , the pandas have to survive to the hunters and the destruction of him habitat by the humans .
Besides , when the bamboos flowering and seeding they die , so until the new bamboos grow enough to be eaten by the pandas takes a long time and this fact forces the pandas to move to new places in order to look for food .
Therefore , the risks of the extinction to the Giant Pandas are real .
I am on the point of finishing my Engineer 's degree in Mining Engineering , specialization in Energy , at Vigo University .
I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing the First Certificate Exam , planned for July and June , respectively .
I would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level , and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these targets .
Thus , the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of realizing an internship in your company .
The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence cost , so the company is not required to pay him a salary .
Furthermore , as the programme is endorsed by European Union , the trainee disposes of accident and liabiliy insurance .
As for the duration , the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months , being 3 months the period covered by the subsistence grant .
I will be completely available to do the internship from next September on .
I can assure you that I will put all my effort into learning and making the most of my stay in your company .
I hope you will consider my application , and look forward to hearing from you .
Dear Jo , I do n't know if your is a good idea .
Now Italy has quite problem with the occupation , it 's very difficult to find a job and the most people find a job in supermarkets .
If you want to try , you can ask in some hotel : you are a native English speaker and you can welcome hosts at the reception .
I live in Valpolicella , a famous land for the wine , and I had already worked in a four stars hotel for high school .
IT was a good experience , the hotel has every comfort you can imagine : a reastaurant , a S.P.A. , a gym , indoor and outdoor swimmingpool , a beauty center and a church .
The personal were n't so much helpful , but someone luckily gave me some advice , especially the porter Artan .
He was amiable and liked Metal Music like me , so we always spoke about our favourite groups .
I do n't know if he still works there , but I 'm sure that you can find a great support in him .
Valpolicella has many location that worth to see : first of all Lake Garda , a lake with the famous phallic shape which divides three different regions ( Veneto , Trentino and Lombardy ) .
Orlando Duque , with the desire to come to the World cups of 2017
Colombian became the first diver to win a world cup in High - Jumps .
Orlando Duque , the Colombian diver , is the champion of high - jumps of the FINA World Cup 2014 , stated that since 2007 he is thinking about retirement even though he feels with force and desire to go to the World cup of 2017 in Guadalajara , México .
" I am thinking about retirement since 2007 . I have been lucky because I injured , I got better " , said Duque during the press conference of the World Series that this year will end up in Mexico on 17th and 18th October , after the competition of Bilbao ( Spain ) .
Duque , who was born in Cali on September 11th of 1974 , took a break in his career because an injury in his right leg in 2011 and after that , he returned in 2013 with the purpose of win the World Cup of Barcelona and the World Cup of FINA .
" I was 40 years three weeks ago , I feel motivated to train , while I have the motivation I can continue ; now I have no an exact date ( … ) I just have set 2017 in Guadalajara " , said Duque , who was the first sportsman who won a world championship of falls from height .
" Jumps have been my life , I have spent all my life in the jumps and it motivate me to do it , I want to continue " , explained Duque when he pointed out that he still has several screws in his right ankle and he is still lacking recover completely .
" The event of the Natural Well of Ik Kil ( Yucatán ) of 2011 was the last one that I had before the accident ; now , I am getting over the accident and I feel at the 70 per cent " , explained the Colombian sportsman who noted down February , 2015 as the date to return .
The Colombian high - jumper presented in Mexico the one that will be the last stage of this series which is promoted by an energy drink in the Natural Well Ik Kil , in the Mexican state of Yucatán .
The Natural Well Ik Kil , which is located three kilometers away from the archeological zone of Chichén Itza , will be the final one of the Jumps season , 2014 and in that season Duque and the Mexican Jonathan Paredes will face each other in order to be between the top five spots of the season .
The Britain Gary Hunt already secured the prize of this series and from the second to the sixth place will be disputed with the Russian Artem Silchenko , the American Steven LoBue , the Colombian Duque , the Britain Blake Aldridge and the Mexican Paredes .
I am located in the fourth place , but we are so close to the second to the fourth ( in points ) so , the idea is jump very well even though the Natural Well is a difficult because it is dark " , explained Duque about his plan for the event in the Ik kil on 17th and 18th October .
In the male test , the high - jumpers are thrown out into the water from a height of 27 meters in height , whereas in the female competition the launch pad is placed 20 meters away .
One may ask why among all those possible activities , this one was chosen .
Of course I do not count running indoors , but only outdoors , while the breeze is blowing in one 's face during the exercise .
There is not exactly a good day for running , for even the rainy days are excellent for a good run .
If one has a sunny and windy weather , it is nice because the sun warms one up and the wind helps keep it fresh .
On the other hand , if it is rainy , the cold water cools it down and make one feel less tired during one 's time .
This is my favorite sport for it improves health in some many ways and boost the resistance and quality of life .
The first times may be hard , in that they require a preparation a sedentary person does not have .
After the first trials , however , improvements are shortly noticed and the results come quickly : better breathing , uninterrupted and quiet sleep , and an unmistakable sense of well - being .
It even helps reducing your belly !
Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce the uncomfortability and keep one 's feet in a nice temperature .
Notwithstanding , a formidable pair of shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period .
Go to a doctor , ask him to analyse the type of step to make up with an ideal footwear .
This way , there will be less trouble when practising the exercise .
Everybody can do , it is practical and simple , and the goals can be set in accord with the person 's needs and restrictions .
Take that pair of snickers and go for it !
I always considered football as a piece of art .
Does not matter how hard the players tried to win , the only thing that matters is the result .
Players must be considered as a paintor working in a piece of art .
Only results will be recognized at the end .
It 's not the efford they have applied or all the hopes they had .
There expectations will be considered unuseful .
Poeple wo n't stare a paint at a museum thinking how hard the artist tried to do a good job , they will judge it only .
Do they like it or not .
After that , if they played a good game will be a plus .
So if someone ever is woundering start practising this sport , they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win .
I would recommend them always remember that , so if things do n't result as they expected , they wo n't feel disappointed .
We are people and all of us must have private life including celebrities .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazz who are trying to know more about their private life .
It is quiet hard to have a rest when journalists are trying to know some exciting things about your private life .
On the other hand famous politicians and film stars have chosen such life .
It is a part of their everyday life , they are used to be on public and they are used to say something about themselves on cameras , so all the people will know about their life .
There are some moments when celebrities need some time to be with their families and friends and journalists must not touch such moments .
Everybody must have free time for yourself .
Good to know from you .
There is a lot of things to visit here .
Starting for the top , like Bilbao or Asturias .
You could do that and then , finish it in Barcelona , were I live .
Finally if you want to find a job for three months Barcelona is a good option to stay .
There are a lot of places where you could work for a short period of time . Beeing a witress or something like this is well paid and not so dificult to do .
Hope that you follow my ideas and you like Spain
In the modern world , the company which has excellent stuff is more competitive , and these employees are usually motivated .
It is clear that staff would spend more time on their tasks if they were motivated by their boss , while unmotivated employees are more likely to spend less effort in their jobs .
Generally speaking , there are two basic methods of employee motivation : rewards involving money and non - financial rewards .
Many leaders believe that money is the best , however , from my own perspective , the non - financial rewards are the best approach to motivate employees and I will prove my opinion in this essay .
I had never been very frightened until one day that something strange happened .
One night , I was talking with my sister about her last trip around Europe , her best friend , Michael , also was there .
My sister claimed that in her trip , she had seen completely astounded buildings , but while she was talking , we heard a very loud scream .
Outside was getting very cold and the sky was dark , so we could n't see anything but nevertheless we continue walking through the trees when suddenly we saw a very big shadow in front of us .
In that moment we started to run , except Michael .
When we got in the house , my sister and I realized that Michael was n't there .
Ana and I decided to go outside to look for Michael , when we went out , he was in front of the house , doing strange sounds , when he saw us , smile to us in a malevolent way , then made us to back inside .
I have noumerous reasons why I choose this sport as my favorite .
For example , if you play basketball and the ball is passed regularly then your team is more likely to win because passes cause confusion and exhaustion to the opponent team .
On the other hand if he chooses to play professionally then he must try hard .
Regular exercising is potentionall so that he / she can build up strength and endurance
To conclude , I hope my advice should be helpful to new starters of the sport .
The whole town is gorgeous and you seem to be in another age of history .
The restaurant has a characteristic decoration indeed because you seem to be inside a train .
However , the most impressive thing is the game of flavours that explode inside your mouth .
My favourite one is a golden egg made of foie .
The connection between quality and price is plenty balanced .
In fact , there are always plenty of people every day so I recommend ordering at least one week before going .
I really think it is suitable for the class because each one of us could know in advance how would pay to eat there and besides this could taste the main courses of this restaurant .
Without shadow of doubt I am absolutely sure this could be the best option for our class .
I 'm not a great fun of films based od fiction , unrealistic facts and events .
I have always preferred to relax during some series or soap opera , but after watching ' Flushed ' I change my point of view .
If you haven't seen it yet , after reading this short text you 'll go to the cinema if you only have a chance .
THE BIRTH OF NEW STAR
I guess that a name Ann Smith tells you nothing .
And that 's obvious because it 's the first serious production of this young , prospective director , whose ' Flushed " became a worldwide hit .
It is said that a well - known cast enabled her to be highly granted for her piece , but I have some doubts about it .
THE STRENGHT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS
And that 's why I find this move so excited .
An enormous amount of additional attractions for viewer provided me with unforgettable feelings .
Everything came us a surprise and you did n't expect that this or that action is just taking place .
The movie requires from us to be strongly concentrated on what is going on and I find it to be one of mostly conceiving factors for those who still have some objections .
The director gives a choice to broaden our mind and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe imaginable ending of the gripping story .
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no cicumstances can we miss it !
The profile of millions of recent graduate and professional people in Spain is a young person , well prepared and without work who are thinking of going abroad as a good chance to get a job .
To work abroad can offer you a good opportunity , maybe it would never happens in your own country , instead .
Furthermore , as well known , salaries are higher in other European countries than in Spain , so your life conditions may increase the same as your career ladder .
On the other hand , going abroad without your family might be a really bad experience , because you may thoroughly miss them , maybe because you are not able to visit them as much as you can due to living far away from home .
For example , if you go to work to England you can see off the bright and sunny Spanish days and say a big welcome to the frightful English weather and depression .
To sum up , the disadvantages of going abroad are higher than the advantages , but every cloud has a silver lining .
Maybe , many people who have studied did it to get a job opportunity in their own country , but life is life .

When I was eight years old I visited Thailand , it was wonderful and we lived at a hotel so close to the beach , I could nearly touch the sand from the pool .
One day we were out to three different Islands in a diving- group .
One of the islands was a cave you had to swam into it , it was very beautiful .
When we were in Thailand we saw many different animals , everything from big leguans to rainbow fishes and deadly sea - snakes .
Every year at the sport - vaccination me , my mom and my sister are going to Switzerland to go skiing in the alps , it 's wonderful and really fun .
We have never seen a marmot but I so want to .
We have went to Champéry a couple of times .
In Champéry you can ski over to France , that is awesome .
We have also went to Verbier , I loved the cabin we slept in there .
Three words that describe me best is perhaps , animal lover , happy and a perfectionist ?
A weakness I would like to eliminate is that I often think or say " I do that later " and never doing it or say the same thing when it 's time to do that .
I like food , especially Italian food , It is my favorite food to eat .
And of Italian food I like pizza ( thin with tuna ) or some delicious pasta the most .
My favorite restaurant is " La Piazza " in Djurholm and it is of course Italian , I have actually been in Italy twice , in Rome and Florence and in a small town named Lucignano in the countryside .
When we were there last summer , I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called Hoopoe .
I like to read too , my favorite type of books is horse books or just random books its hard to explain but I mean , books with daily action not sciene - fiction or romantic .
Some of the books I like is named only way is up and steal the show and is written by Emmy Abrahamson , I think she is a very well author , another author I like is John Boyne who has written the terrible thing that happened to Barnaby brocket .
Right now I read a book called " the maze runner " it is very exciting .
When I grow up I want to be a vet , it 's a dream come true for me , I hope I will go to other countries like Australia and job there as a vet for a couple of years . I have never been blood scared or something like that and I would love to have a job I think is fun lifetime out .
Another dream job for me would be an art - director .
I love to design presentations and edit things at the computer but also in real life like my room , clip - art and more .
Parkour is a discipline in which its main proporse is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and faster way without causing no harm to your body .
Parkour was developed in Lisses , Frace , around the 1980 's .
One of the faundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method created by Georges Hébert .
Basicaly , the method is based in develop the main foundations of moviment of the human body , they are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped moviment , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
Raimond Belle was a former Vietnam souldier and worked as a fireman in the French army .
He had a great background in gymnastics and , sice he was a teenage , he used to do a lot of exercises .
The roots of Parkour was developed by him and he taught some of Parkour thechniques to the fireman which he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too .
David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment and then the actual Parkour was born .
Some people say that David criated Parkour but , in fact , his father develop all the idea of the discipline .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosofical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a frase Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that in a dangerous situation you will be able to save yourself and other people and so on .
Therefore , is due to its philosofy and the joy that I fell before , during and after a train , this is why Parkour is my favorite exercise .
Nowadays our society has become very lazy due to the use of the car or the motorbike .
There are less people who use the public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than in public transport .
For this reason , the use of public transport is going down , and some experts say that there is no future for the public transport .
For lot of people , travel by your own car is more comfortable than travel by public transport like bus or metro , because you do not depend on a schedule , that it is very common when you take public transport .
Conversely , when you travel by your own car , you save a lot of time during the journey .
However , public transport has also advantages .
On the one hand , public transport affords you to waste money , because the price of the ticket is not very expensive .
On the other , travelling by metro or bus pollute less than going by car .
The reason is that when you use the car , you normally go on your own and when you travel by metro or car lot of people are travelling at the same time as you .
For me , people have become very lazy and they prefer the car rather than puiblic transport , because you can take the car when you want and go where you want whotout spending hours waiting for the bus .
The consequence of this is that in the near future the public transport will disappear .
The product will be registered with Ministry of Helath and SriLanka standerds Association and adhere their rules and regulatiuon for production , storing and distribution .
We will not compromise the quality of the production process or the product for any cost .
The company will ensure that , the low negative environmental impact due to the production process .
The company will set the retail price same as other bottled water products in market .
But we will give a good price to retailers and hotels to sell our products more in market .
The direct supplies to offices , households and hotels also will be given good price with the delivery service .
We will rent water dispensers with a maintenance services to required customers in future to attract more customers .
For example , cars are the main kind of transport because of this most of the families have more than one in their houses .
However , changes always has a negative side .
According to the last studies , pollution increases this year in the biggest cities whereas it goes down in villages .
On the other hand , cities are more worried about how to recycle their rubbish than in villages .
To resolve this trouble , my village has created a plan to teach its population how important it is to take care of the environment and how to do it .
For this reason , we have new containers to separate all rubbish : we have to throw away bottles , cans and cartons into the yellow ; paper and cardboard go to the blue and there is another one for glass .
The council also has put over one hundred bins around the village to keep clean our streets .
At the school , children are learning how to spend less water or electricity at home .
Turn off the lights when you do n't stay in a room or do not waste water while you are brushing your teeth are some of advice .
I hope these simple actions can be used for other people because the environment needs that we work together for a better world .
Name of the factory is Baťa .
Tomáš Baťa had own office , but do you know what is a little bit strange ?
He had to control his employees and this way did n't take him so much time .
When you get on the last floor , there 's a large terrace and cafe .
You can offer a delicious coffee , tea or cake and you can watch the beauty .
It may not be your cup of tea , but I think it 's the most interesting and beautiful place in our town . I 'm looking forward to see you !
When visiting Copenhagen during summer time there is a huge variety of shops and restaurants that will give you a sense of the Copenhagen lifestyle .
Start your day by joining the many joggers along the city lakes , there is a small cafe , " Kaffe Salonen " , where you can grab a coffee to - go and enjoy the morning sun on one of the many benches looking out on to the lakes and many birds .
Lining the streets are small second - hand shops , cafes , markets and boutiques that are daily visited by the local people .
If you get tired of wondering the streets then you can always enter the big shopping store Magasin for more indoor shopping .
The shops close at around six and eight o'clock in the evening .
When you are tired of shopping take the bus to the West Side of Copenhagen where there is a vast choice of restaurants , everything from Italian to Chinese to Danish cuisine .
If you like an evening stroll or a night out , walk through Istedgade for a glimpse of the old Copenhagen and the nightlife is offers .
Fashion , a popular topic .
We all wear clothes , do we ?
And most people think about what they wear , although some do n't care about there clothing .
I talked about this topic with a few other students and asked them what there opinion is .
The first question we discussed was : ' Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufactures ? '
Their opinios first varied a bit here .
An argument some called was:'In case we remove this whole industry , then there would be an humangous group of peoole unemployed , and that would be a problem . '
The others answered on this with the question : ' When does a company starts making something , just because they want something to do ? '
This question made the other group doubt a bit , they did agree that a company does n't just start making something to have something to do .
Next question we talked about the following question:'Does it have too much effect on models ? ' They did n't have to think about their opinion , they all directly said ' Yes ' .
They told that if you wanted to be a model , you had to fit in a size of clothing which is really small .
There is immense group of girls who really want to be a model , caused by the fact that they do n't fit in this clothing yet they have to lose weight .
Much girls are losing too much weight right then because they want to be ' perfect ' and got anorexia and those things .
The following question which we talked about was:'Does it have too much influence on young people ? '
In their opinion young people , also themselves , were very busy with fashion and clothes .
An example on which they all agreed was:'In case you just met your new class , and you had to choose next to who you had to sit the most people were going to sit next to the girl or boy with the trendy clothes ' .
The next question was:'Does it make society materialistic and competitive ?
The students were a bit doubting but agreed on the fact that people who have stylish clothes are usually the most popular .
And there 're a lot of people who want to be popular , so they are going to buy trendy clothing .
The last and probably the most difficult question we discussed was:'Does it affect the way you dress and the kinds of clothes you buy ? '
They all said it kind of did affect however they also bought clothes they liked .
I asked them the question:'If you liked a piece of clothing but your friends did n't , would you then have bought it ? '
But where do we decide on which clothes we wear ?
And do you have to like your clothes or someone else ?
It was a lovely and sunny day .
I was gardening since the beginning of the morning , when the postman arrived .
At that moment , my dog was kidding with a ball that was small and green .
I was not expect any letter .
I totally do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transportation because of car existences .
General public are using the public transportation more than before .
students who are not allowed to drive still using the public transportation and they will always do .
Moreover , the traffics on areas such as down town enforced people to use the public transportation as train , since the trains are faster .
Insurances are so expensive in north America , most of householder are not using the car because of insurance , and also because of adding cost as fixing the cars , changing car oils and etc .
Furthermore , Government are enhancing the public transportation by services they are providing with lower cost . the fair for raid in public transportation are more less than the cost of driving the car at the same distance .
Finally , none will argue that the benefit of using cars over public transportation , but that does not excluded the public transportation .
Although I was watching it from backstage , the atmosphere was the same as I 'd have been watching it in front of the stage together with other fans .
There is a lot of work during the concert preparation .
We had to check if everything is correct : sound , light , special effects .
Besides , we have to watch if the band have everything that they need : something to eat and to drink , I was responsible for it .
I had to satisfy all of whims of the stars .
The opportunity to meet your idols in real was the most exciting .
Attachment we return you back text of the doctoral thesis of , directed by Dr. , requesting you to fill out the detailed report of evaluation , also enclosed .
If you have any incident on receipt of it , we kindly ask you to inform us , to put it in order as soon as possible .
Vacation is what we have waited for three long months of hard studies , homework , tests and more .
Even though we have finished the term exams , they have just given us a week free .
From there we went to the mall and for last to Juanca 's house .
Saturday I helped a friend with his party and made 64 dollars .
Sunday I went to the mall with the same people .
The group is named Hogwarts
From Monday till Friday I was in .
Boquete where I did nothing and Saturday I came back .
That night I went to Oz with my friends till 2 in the morning .
The last day I went to Nashla 's pool and ordered 50 chicken wings .
I did not do much
The summary of my vacations is that the time I spent with friends I had a good time but when I was with my family y got bored .
But the same as I thought you 'd never love me for much long time , if you could ever do it , I always thought that Nastaran would be the girl of my life , if there were any .
But I lost her after a little kiss from the cheek in the first date .
Of course after that I never thought that I ever had the chance .
But once one of her friends told me that before the kiss , everything was to be ok .
And since then it 's the most pain .
I know it may seem as a meanness of her .
Since I have a specific feeling by now , I thought of sharing it with you .
And I used the English 'cause it would be more spoiled in Farsi .
Belarus is not a popular tourist destination nowadays but a lot of people would be surprised to find real medieval atmosphere in Grodno , a western city of the country .
Founded in the 12th century , it came through all important events of Eastern Europe history , from Tatar invasions till the World War II which was a real disaster .
Two ancient castles remind us of the times of kings and nobility , quiet pedestrian streets show us the life as it could be in the 1800s .
Grodno is situated on the crossroads of great trading ways that 's why one could hear Polish , Jewish , German , Lithuanian there .
Its multiethnic population was the reason to organise and held the Festival of national cultures every two years .
It 's worth visiting because traditions of the ancient Belarusian , Tatar , Russian , Jewish shown alive make us feel history itself .
City of different religions , different nationalities and " talking stones " is waiting for you .
The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve or Zoo makes it very attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities .
These include facilities like ample vehicle parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge , elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls in the case of carrying very heavy loads of purchases and relaxation spots like Cinemas and gaming centers for kids .
In addition , most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people ; as this is a statutory requirement to building a shopping mall .
As a matter of fact , Shop - rite is one of the best place in my opinion , that I would advise people to visit .
It products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors .
Besides , this shop is not too far from the known natural games reserve in Lekki area of Lagos .
This is where you would find several shops that sell most African traditional artifact .
I will rather advice tourist to pay this market a visit to enable them have choices of priceless products .
I hope from the explanations , I have been able to convince you with respect to my opinion about the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities that abounds as you take your time in considering visiting them .
In developed countries , four wheels gain high appreciation in everyday transportation .
In capital cities of Europe one can easily notice how many people prefer their own means instead of the pushing crowd of public transportation .
It is however well known after a plethora of scientific publications that cars harm the environment dramatically .
On the other hand , modern citizens like to be part of green revolution and carbon footprint has an effect in everyday decision making .
Many organizations and public authorities encourage workers to use public means of transport to and from the job place in order to minimize greenhouse gases emissions and save natural resources .
As a result , before private transportation reaches its pick for 21st century , it is more probably green mobility overlaps it and dominates in people choice .
There is great future for public transport , same for bicycling and on foot travelling instead of cars and other polluting machines .
I 'm pretty excited to be in London from the 11th .
I 'm arriving at the train station in the morning at 6 o'clock .
Do n't be afraid not to recognise me because I haven't changed a lot in two years , but for your confidence I will be with a bright orange suitcase .
I 'm waiting for meeting with your family and in this case that we will be staying with Eileen , I want to bring her something .
What can it be ?
I would like to visit Big Ben Tower and many other places that you will propose , but I do n't really want to see common tourist sights , so if you could show me something that not everyone can find , I would appreciate that .
Best places to young people visit in New York ?
I am doubtless it is an easy task : here you can visit many entertaining facilities , where you can find technology or culture , for example , and there are also many places to eat , dance , etc .
The Statue of Liberty is by far the most famous building at the city .
The Times Square is a good site for buying too , although the excessive quantity of advertisement is a little bit annoying .
Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , antropology and viewing a lot of types of arts .
Talking about places to eat or dance , near the Grand Station you can find the ' Num Pang ' , a good place to eat sandwich .
Remarkably , teenagers like eating this and it is where you can find one of the best .
Around the Central Park , there is one of my favourite bakery : '
Have a good travel !
I utterly agree with the statement : travelling by car is much more convenient , because you can go wherever you want without waiting for a bus or train at a bus stop or station .
I think that travelling by car is also more inner and comfortable because you only travel with people you know .
Talking about money probably car is more convenient , even if you have to pay for fuel , highway and everything that is necessary to the maintenance of the car .
As a result , if you use public transport , you have to pay an expensive subscription and different tickets .
So people prefer travelling with their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way .
On the other hand , if we do n't use public transport and every person use a car , pollution will increase a lot .
We can also say that with cars you have to find a parking , so you can waste time and sometimes pay for that .
Eventually we should use public transport to reduce pollution , but they have to be more checked and repaired .
I agree with the statement , fmous people deserve to have a private life without life jouralists following them all the time .
Fame is a choice of many people , it was their dream .
But it does n't mean they haven't got some rights to have private life .
Many of them have got family members , who do n't want to have anything in common with fame .
Usually journalists also following them all the time .
Sometimes happens , that journalists write some silly gosspis about famous people , which are not true .
It may be a danger for family of a celebrity , politician , famous person , because of them some could broke up .
They want to be rich and famous and they know , that journalist will be follow them .
If you 're a queen , member of royal family , from your birth you 'll be observing by press and magazines .
Altought it does n't mean , that press should write about privacy .
Public activity is one of the most important thing .
In my opinion , the television has an important role in the society because it can influence in people 's life .
I mean people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language with different programs that television offers or just put subtitles to make it simple .
It 's important to know what it 's happening in the world because it can enrich your knowledge culturally , politically , etc .
Besides you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if many severe situations are being occurred in your country .
Children learn a lot of things with cartoons , it can help them to improve the speaking and to know new vocabulary .
So , for that reason I think television can entertain and also educate .
I 'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if it 's sad or the break of someone 's on its free time .
Watching TV can be funny and nice but watching it in excess can be bad and not healthy for your life .
I always believe I can become an engineer and computer technician to invent more things since I was small .
After I receive more and more information about some successful engineer and inventor such as Steve Jobs , I realize that no matter who you are and how smart you are , you can not live without a healthy body .
Consequently , I believe physical development is the necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful for providing me opportunities of extra - curricular activities .
I like the feeling of getting sweat and a great passion in swimming .
Therefore , to maintain my body healthy and my interest , I keep on joining the School Aquathon since I was secondary one . I participated the same events each year .
It allows me know my body state and whether I have relapsed .
Besides it gave me a motion to train harder and never have a thinking of giving up that I need to keep my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body .
Also , under the harsh training , it trains my willpower and setting goal .
I learnt setting a proper goal as it is a significant factor to success .
This goal push me forward to do better and better each time .
I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after take part in School Aquathon and saw others got improved but not just me .
I reckon learning and trying more kinds of things can change my school life to become more colorful .
School work and examinations gave me huge pressure so I found a way to strike a balance that I learnt playing windsurfing .
In my eyes , windsurfing is special and indispensable to me .
When I step on the surfing board , all my vexation and misgiving were gone .
Under the recommendation of my instructor , I joined the Joint school windsurfing competition .
On that day I found something wrong with my position on the result board . I was shocked and decided protest for the wrongdoings of the race committee .
After several meetings , I got my position back and I have learnt that we should believe ourselves .
Also I got trained my body and become more healthy .
The hottest issue nowadays is the global warming .
Therefore I paid more attention at global warming and ways to deal with it .
It is part of my dream that I wish I can have an invention to solve the problem in the future .
To know more information having a green lifestyle , I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013 .
One of the purpose of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle , so I got a better physical development .
To have more different experience , I have joined the " Dialogue in the dark " experiential exhibition .
In the total dark environment , I experience the feeling of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their livings .
After undergo this experience , I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future .
I get a greater passions in engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life .
Also I have learnt the communication skills with others and be considerate .
Under the colorful school life , I undergo different type of experience and I finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician .
I think it is not a good engineer who only got skills of engineering .
Therefore I reckon my experience can trained me to be admitted as a suitable candidate of engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal .
People differ from each other and everyone have various professions .
Being a politician or a filmstar has something in common : those people are famous .
And , as a draback of being acelebrity , they are followed by papparazzi almost everywhere .
But do n't they deserve to have more private life ?
I think that journalists should remember about the private life of famous people which is deserved to stay in secret for other people .
There are a lot of cases known when journalists would make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists .
And for some people it does n't really matter if it was found out that someone was in a bar for example as long as their films are really worth watching .
Besides , being foollowed by unknown people ought to be quite a scary experience .
Some people would say that it 's necessary for usual people to know how the politician lives so they could know if he should be trusted .
That 's for sure an important thing to know for voters .

It is a fact that the public is getting worse year by year specially here in Peru , however we have to think about the benefits that public transport has , for instance it can be a cost - effective way to get to work , so there will be no space for public transport in the future ?
Hundreds of people take buses at any time , one of the main reason for this is that they have not got their own car .
As a result , not only is public transport the option they have , but it is also the only one .
It 's known that over the years the system have improved and new means of transport have been offered such as trains and trolleys all of them with just one objective to transport a mass of people at a quick time .
On the other hand the number people who can afford a car and the cost that it involves have gone up over the last few years and one of the main reasons they have it because of the comfort , also they claim that they can get their work faster than public transport .
Michael sat in the bus and take out his dairy to calculate how much he have to invest in the tennis court .
A girl came and sat in the seat next to him .
She asked him when the bus is going to depart but Michael replied that he was also not aware of the departure time .
The bus starts after half an hour and Michael start talking with his parents over the phone and discussed his business .
The strange girl who was sitting next to him was listening to music and looking outside trying to ignore the details that Michael was sharing with his parents .
It was a 13 hour journey and the girl wanted to talk with Michael and so she offered chips but he denied .
After some time the bus stopped for 5 min and Michael bought two chocolates , chips and a soft drink and offered her a chocolate .
This is how they start their conversation and while exchanging conversation , they felt as if they know each other for a long time ... they got attracted towards each other and in the midst of that they kissed each other and even exchanged phone numbers .
Their bus was about to reach their destination next morning so Michael offered her to drop at home and the girl agreed with a smile .
At that time they felt not like parting but they have to and Michael dropped her home and returned back to his own home .
After returning home , Michael flash backed what he did in the bus .
Michael took a deep breath and look at the entrance door that was still open .
Dear Sir :
This advertisement requeste a group of young people to work in summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , my name is Lorena and I have twenty - three years old and I am from Spain and I would like to job in your summer camp because I can improve my English level and earn money ; my English level is so good due to all this year I have been in English academy to learn the language and now I am going to take another certificate ; and just like that I will be able to communicate with children .
Secondly , last year I stayed in a beach summer camp and there were children aged 6 - 13 , besides my partner and I prepared water activities when the weather was good , against ; when the weather was bad we prepared puzzles games , adventure games , etc .
The advertisement talks about work in the kitchens ; our summer camp was little because it was in a small town so we had to cook children food and I could do it without problems .
Yours faithfully .
Michale will never forget the day as long as he lived .
It was on Saturday morning around 10.30 .
He went to the church on that day .
It was the Seventh day Adventist church which the ritual was to worship on Saturday .
Honestly , as eight years old boy who knows Christianity close to nothing , his knowledge of Christianity was lower than a 3 year - old child .
Anxiousness got the better of him as he prepare himself to enter the sanctuary .
In his mind , the only reason I was there was just to see the girl he had my crush on and to know some of her church friends .
WHATTTT I MISSPELLED MICHAEL!!Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transport means travelling around the world and cities by using trains , buses , taxi , airplanes etc .
Some years ago people believed that private cars would be the main vehicle to move around but nowadays , due to economic crisis , most of the people have changed their minds ; they believe that public transport would be the main way to move around in the future for many reasons .
First of all , travelling by cars is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars should pay for gas , insurance , repairing , environmnet fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .
Secondly , people who use public transport are safer than others who use private cars ; if they drink more than usual and drive their cars ; there are a lot car accidents due to drivers are drunk .
Finally , the traffic jam is much less if people use public transport than using private cars ; the developed countries have built a public transport system so to avoid traffic jam , why people not using it ?
I strongly believe that in the near future public transport will be the main vehicle to travel around the world , safe and cheap .
Michael had just woken up , he felt a Little bit thirsty so he went to the kitchen for fresh water .
As he could n't sleep anymore he dressed up and brought his brother to the park .
His mother would be probably working , she was a realtor and would be selling a house .
It was a windy day so they kept their jackets and scarf .
When Michael and his little brother , Jackson , arrived at the park , noticed that there was n't anybody around .
The park was sealed by a green tape which said " danger zone keep away " .
Suddenly two people dressed as astronauts were leaving the park and advertised to the young boys to go to their house and wait until these unfortunately event was over .
Tom and Jack were curious about what had happened but they did n't know from were to take answers .
While they were walking back home they heard a journalist commenting what incident have happened to the park .
The only thing they could clearly heard was : - But this can only be caused by the contamination , although these windy day hasn't helped .
Jackson stopped walking and get distracted by a beautiful dog , Michael continued on his way unaware Jackson was n't following him .
Almost arriving at home and mulling over the thoughts take his own conclusions to what could might have happened .
And wanted to share them with jack but ...
What I think it 's stupid is that most people use to hide their faces from behind the screen and no one wants to appreciate a sunny day anymore !
What I disagree about this video is because he is generalizing too much .
I think it is cool to have a social network , and there is nothing wrong to let kids enjoy the technology that became part of our generation .
However , they must be controlled and especially by their parents .
I believe the old values should have been taught for children in schools .
I 've experienced this , so that 's why I am saying .
The internet has caused me depression once , I felt really alone and I used to be someone who I was n't in the real life , but I learned how to deal with it .
I am afraid more people pass through for the same thing
Some people love shopping and some people can not live without shopping .
I Am from the first type of people .
After that , we can go at cafe and take some good coffee .
Some of brands are excellent and really cool in my city .
For example H&M. It is brilliant shop .
There are all of styles of clothes .
Sportswear , elegant clothes and of course accessories .
Everyone can find right his styles , so I recommend it .
Visiting the centre of the city is really fascinating : Piazza del Duomo is one of the most suggestive squares in Italy with the particularity of the white marble facade of the Dome and his multitude of pinnacles .
The surroundings are dedicated to the fashion : you can find the most important shops for whom Milan is known in the whole world .
In the same area , people often have the chance to attend free concerts of Italian singers and some foreign artists .
The Sforzesco Castle is another suggestive historic monument and the green Sempione park is one of the best place where people can practise sport or can attend a yoga class in the middle of the wildlife .
Finally people can experiment the Milanese nightlife in the area of the Navigli , which are really crowded from 19 till late .
Here you can experience the typical Milanese aperitif , during which you can have a cocktail while eating whatever you want and you can get to know many young people .
Jack Pollard a street fighter known as Crazy dog lives downtown LA .
One night when he is walking aimlessly in a privacy alley he sees a shadow which gradually comes to him .
At first he does n't care but suddenly sees it in front , an owner - less shadow .
He turns his head around to find the source of shadow but ca n't find anything so he feels fear but controls himself and yells : who are you ?
Hey if it 's a kidding , stop it , it 's not funny .
Suddenly , shadow covers him and crazy dog falls on the ground and dies .
The police announced checkout is the murder motivation .
A detective named James Reilly wants to find out the reason for murder and to arrest murderer .
He realizes crazy dog killed an innocent man named Joe Mendez last year but his body was not found .
In Mendez house in the suburb , Reilly found some old photos showing the sequel of criminals .
They all were tortured viciously before death .
It was around 9 PM when Reilly was there .
Suddenly he hears a weak voice whispering ; do not try to stop the shadow , let it kill the criminals or you 'll die .
He sees a shadow out of the house and follows it until it stands at the end of graveyard .
He goes there and sees a pile of garbage quickly brushes aside it and observes a hole in the ground .
He goes inside it and discovers a half decayed body that was compatible with Mendez identities .
He understands that the shadow was ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez 's murderer .
I think this thriller is exciting because it shows a ghost with killing ability .
I think since this idea is creative people will like to watch it .
She knew what does that it meant , Jason was alive .
She kwew that he will be staying away for so long but she will wait .
She loves him and any World War was able to separe them , because she was pregnant and this baby was coming , it was a boy and his name was going to be Taylor just like Jasons ' father .
Alison took a pen and a piece of paper and wrote an answer for Jason , as fast as she could because the postman was leaving in one hour .
She was so excited and happy , she did n't kwen what could she write for her lover , she noticed that he was alive so she just wrote ' Dear , please take care of yourself , we will be here waiting for you , i 'm pregnant , it 's a boy , if you let me his name will be Taylor as your fathers ' name , I have always loved you and I always will , do your best , come back as soon as you can because I need you , love Alison ' .
She could n't stop smiling because she had just noticed that she would n't be alone anymore
The purpose of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in Pamplona , and to outline some recommending shops that might appeal tourists with different interests .
As might have been expected , a main city as Pamplona is well equipped to deal with a large number of tourist and residents going shopping .
In addition , several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located on the centre with easy access and cheap rates .
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionite about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
Moreover , a store known as " KUXUMUSU " offers all kinds of bulls - related souvenirs and genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country 's culture .
I would strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter about their interest , should visit the special shops aforementioned .
There is little doutbt that they will not only find original products , but will also enrich their minds .
Famous people should realize that if they try to gain famous all the time and waste their time on it , they will not have their own private life .
On the other hand , they are still normal peolple , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
Probably , they want to go on holidays without recognise by other people , without giving autographs and taking photos .
Moreover , from time to time they prefer to leave house without make up and beautiful clothes .
Wahat is more , I am sure , that most of them do it on purpose because their main aim is the famuos .
And celebrities well know that they have to be controversial cause that is the best way to achieve their lovely famous .
So big names try to go somewhere without guards , without make ups to show themselves to cause some juicy gossip about them to gain famous in the easiest way .
To sum up , famous is ambivalent and people who want to be famous should realize it before become a star .
I found the advertisement on you website and I 'm sure that I 'm the person you are looking for .
Although I 'm Italian native speaking , I 've been studying English for seven years ; furthermore last summer I spent two months in Philadelphia so I can communicate quite well in your language .
I 'm really cheerful and hardworking , and I have good marks at sport .
I link a page of my school magazine where you can find my CV .
As I enjoy cooking , I 'm suitable also for the work in the kitchens .
I have saved some money to pay the air fare .
I live in Italy , so I ca n't easily meet you for the interview , but I hope we could manage for an interview on skype in the next days .
I 'm available every aftenoon from 5 to 8 p.m. , while in the USA is morning .
How is it to be famous ?
How the famous people feel and what they miss ?
Everyone deserves his own privacy , own peace , time just for him and famous people too .
Many of journalist or photographers think when they write some gossip about politicians or when they take some " curios " photos , it 's ok .
They may hurt these people , they may ruined their life just using a bad word .
It must be really stressed when you ca n't come anywhere without journalists following you .
And also it must be really uncomfortable for friends or family who go with you .
It is a big pressure .
Of course some of famous people might like this feeling that they are so likely and favourite and they , who do n't like it they have a posibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalist following them do n't exist .
If I am honest , I have to say , I would not be famous if I would lose my life .
My town uses only uses electric cars because they do n't dive out carbon dioxide .
Public transport is going to face a huge decrease in the near future .
New technologies are changing the way of thinking private cars in a new much more save and ecological way .
On the one hand , public transport is well known by their large amount of benefices like less pollution and more economical aspects .
Moreover , large crowded cities using underground or bus are usually a good way to avoid traffic jams , saving time and stress of sad drivers during commutations .
For that reason , fomenting the use of public transport has been the main concern of most of modern governments .
On the other hand , huge technological improvements in car features like self - driving , electrical engines , solar power and others , have created a new perspective of conceiving the way we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving . Resulting as a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time we are driving .
However , that is really close to change by Google 's Self - Drive Car which is a new technology able to drive our car to any destination without humane intervention .
That exiting news open a new world of possibilities for the use of cars .
For instance , imagine going to work and order the car going to park home after take your children at school .
In addition , many other improvements like electric engines from Tesla are getting new benefices to this new concept of Intelligent - Cars .
To summarise , cars are going to be so independent , ecological , cheep and intelligent that we will never take a public transport again .
I like to play soccer , dance and sing . I like to dance because I can do a little bit whatever I want when I dance and only a few people is judging me .
I like to play soccer because I get to hang out with friends and train at the same time .
My favorite food is sushi , and my favorite drink is a pink drink with Pineapple in it . I like sushi because it is fresh and sweet and at the same time it is sour .
I want a kitten but my mom is allergic so we ca n't have one .
I was born in July 25th 2003 .
I have a brother named Markus who wants to be a professional tennis player when he gets older , he is 17 years old .
My mom 's name is Katarina and she likes to sing , she turns 50 this year .
My dad 's name Björn and he likes Tang So Do and to swim , he is 52 years old .
we did n't seen for a while so you do n't know much about me lately .
Last month I was training at a concert by decorated the scene and seriously came out better then I expected to .
The bulbs were red and the ground was full of yellow flowers .
Seems simple but looks beautiful , sometimes the simplicity is the most perfect accessorise .
I was happy helping those people , because money from the tickets were donated to a nursing house .
Nowadays people care more about themeselves and making good things for some of them is wrong !
I 'm sad when I see a nursing house but you know , there , people will never talk whether they do bad or good and in the end of the day , they will not care only about themselves and their insecurity .
We need more caring person !
I am really happy you write to me for some advice and I am very honourated that you want to spend some time in my country .
Now you have got lots of free time and I think that you must make a really good tour of my country .
Firstly you have to decide if you want to visit the North or the South part of Itlay because if you do a full immertion tour of the intire Peninsula you visit neither a half of all you have to visit .
If you decide to visit the North part I think is good if you start from Trento and his new museum about nature called Muse .
It is very beautiful because it is structured like a mountain ( and so you can start from the last floor and then you go down visiting other floors ) .
There you must see the center of the city because we have the Dome ( the Church ) , the gallery near the Dome , the little hidden church called S.Satiro and , at the end , the Sforza 's castle .
Then you must visit Venice the city on the water where every part of the city is a little treasure .
If you like the Egyptian story you can go to Tourin where you can find a huge and beautiful museum about Ancient Egypt .
If you want to visit the South part of Italy you must start your trip from Florence , the bithplace of the culture , then you must go down to Rome the capital city of my country .
After that you have seen the Coliseum , the Basilic of S.Peter and the Trevi fountain and so on you must visit Naples .
In that wonderful city you must visit the statue of Jesus Christ called " il Cristo velato " made by marble and then you must visit the centre of the city , full of fantastic features that make this city really particular like Spaccanapoli , Hidden Napoli , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio Church and so on .
If you are a little bit tired of all this trip you can go to Sicily where a beautiful and special landscape can welcome you .
There ale lots of things to visit in Sicily and the most important cities are : Palermo , Messima , Siracusa , Noto , Ragusa , Trapani , Agrigento ..
The idea to find a job that lasts thre month is great ..
I think you could work as an entretainer in some tourist villages roun the country .
In that way you colud improve your way to make a relationship with people and also it could be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your hability , so I think that you could do some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .
Honestly I think that it could be hard ( just because you haven't so much time ) but I know that sooner or later there will be a photo event ... It 's not much but you can start from it to let other people know about your talent .
I hope that my advices will help you and I also hope that you have a great time in my country ! !
Let me know if you enjoy yout tour and take lots of photos ( I want to see them soon )
Nowadays , people have different viewpoints about whether the most principle concern of choosing an occupation is salary .
Personally , I disagree with that the money is the most important consideration for deciding a job , because there are several factors equally important .
Working in a company which is built up with good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily obtain the fulfillment and keep passion in job for a long time .
We would believe that this job is worth contributing to for life .
Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring workers the senses of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence the working quality may arise greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessary for people 's daily lives , satisfying their basic demand .
For example , the expenditure of food , drinks and commodities need the support from the steady income .
Furthermore , we may need much more money to have some activities , such as worldwide travel or outdoor camping for days .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , health - care would be increasingly important with people getting older , hence enough amount of money as a stable income could not be disregard .
Karate gave me a new purpose of life .
This is one reason why it is my most favorite sport .
Once entering a class , you are able to fully concentrate on the sport .
There are certain procedures in the beginning of a class which encourages you to empty your mind and be ready for class .
Especially in our hectic world it is very important to find to yourself and just listen to your body .
As a martial artist you start to get a great fitness and your balance will improve a lot as well as your flexibility .
Many characteristics will increase immensely such as confidence , self - defense or responsibility .
You will find that you will not only benefit from those in your normal life , but also in your job .
Karate can be started by anyone and any age .
However to see any improvements you should attend regularly and at least twice a week .
Only then it starts to make great fun and you certainly will not regret that you have taken it up . Enjoy ! !
Good Morning :
I 'm writing to apply for one of yours advertisement publised in the local newspaper last week .
I mean , the " Usa Summer Camps " .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the priviledge of working as a teacher all my live , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care children .
Due to my experience as a teacher I am sure that I could have any difficulty in organising sports and inventing a wide range of activities in order to entertain children .
As well as , take part in activities about cookering .
In addition to this , I bear in mind to improve my English through my work and of this way be able to teach the children some basic skill about this universal language .
I would be grateful if you would send me more information of this work and you can get in touch with my on 671234567 .
I look forward to hearing from you early .
In my opinion if you want to meet people of our age I suggest going to the most famous local or places of the city .
We can see each other in the centre and then we visit the city all together .
Although the weather can change more easily , so you should bring different kinds of clothes both heavy and light .
The perfect outfit can be a pair of trousers , a t - shirt and a jacket .
At night , the noise was annoiying , I was not able to rest properly .
Besides , the phone did not work properly , it was imposible the use of it to call the receptionist .
In addition the elvetor was out of order .
In the end , to my surprise , the price was more expensive than I expected as it was announced in your web .
It seems a tax was the excuse , but in my opinion this is a deceit .
I regret to inform you that if you do not offer my apologies and a compensation for all the disturbance caused to me I would go to the main authority .
When I was about three years old we moved here , to Danderyd .
I lived in a yellow house , not far away from where I live now ( probably just five minutes ) until a year ago when we moved to a much bigger house .
I live here with my wonderful family based on my mum Aylin , my dad Tom , my two really annoying brothers Hans and Oliwer , and my two cats Tiger and Smilla .
I go by cycle to " Fribergaskolan " every day together with my friends Tekla , Julia and Bianca .
On Monday and Thursday I dance at a dance - school here , close to " Mörby Centrum " , called C - style .
I also like riding horses , that is one of the thing I often do when we are at Gotland , by the way .
Right now I 'm actually in a riding course every Sunday .
We are just three girl , and I think this kind of riding is so much more fun than riding at a stable with big groups and so on .
I really like Spain , we have been there like six times and the reason is that my dad has a project there and sometimes he has to go there for a week or less and we have the luck to be able to join him .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " it 's an Asian buffé and they make the best food .
My favorite subject in school is probably Swedish , English or biologi .
My favorite book is right now : " The fault in our stars " because its a really good subject and it is sad but great story .
On the holidays and after school I 'm often with my friends and family .
I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost everyone of them in my old school ( called Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other big hobbies is photographing .
I got one own camera , it 's a Canon .
I wanted to go out to her so I open the door on the wrong side by putting my long finger and ring finger in the little crevice .
Suddenly a powerful wind make the door blow up and squeeze my finger really hard .
I screamed and it started to bleed really much .
My fingers were almost cut so my dad wrapped my fingers in bandage and we drove to the doctor as fast as we could .
They had to sew my finger but in the end everything went fine .
And today I got normal fingers .
Three words who describe me best : committed , animal lover , loyal friend
That was the most important fact about me .
In camden every block counts with three or four containers to recycle paper , plastic , glass and old clothes .
The council recollects , once a week , door to door paper and organic waste .
What is more , people are encouraged to collect rain water to use in these activities .
Public transport was made accessible by reducing the fares and making it free for students .
Nowadays there are a lot of information about healthy , in order to have good food habits , sleep the amounght of hours recommended by specialist doctors , etc .
For these reasons I consider that could be a good option doing any sport that you like or you may be interested in .
In my case I really like doing spinning , I use to do it only twice per week but now I do that every time I can .
I think that in particular , spinning is a hard sport activity because when you was approximately 1 hour over your bike you 'll probably feel taired .
During the process people works a lot their legs , mixing different positions and speeds , And the most important thing , the musis is always running .
If you want to lose weight this type of sport is perfect because it belong into the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food whereas it is suitable to people that only just doing exercise to entertainment .
Furthermore from the first time that I was in the gym I have known nice and friendly sportsman who try to give me advice not only how improve my techniques but how avoid injury .
Although it is kind of hard for young people who finished school finally , to understand that it 's definitely not finish yet , education do n't stops from then on and it is one of the most important things to continue going to school .
On the the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't really have the opportunity to choose , if they want to go or not .
They finish school at the age of 23 - 24 including a further study without a chance of work or anything else .
To this , I think , it is a way which goes in the wrong direction .
Try to motivate people for education , studying and school is a very hard thing if they all know all those Imaginations are not going to happen anyway , whereas people in Switzerland have to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possibilities look like .
Therefore , education should be reachable for everyone , in my opinion , as long as possible , but only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
Only if all of that is guaranteed the motivation will rise .
Now shopping became one of the best way to spend time with family or friends , but not everyone like it .
For the most of men shopping is so boring and exhausting , but for the women it can be the best way to make better their mood , because they are so happy when they buy many clothes on sale , cheaper than in regular price .
I think that the shopping is not enjoyable for everyone when in the shops are a crowd and very long queue .
In the big shopping centre your pocket can be stolen by pickpocket and you can lost a lot of money .
Personally I really like shopping , because I am interested in fashion and I like look good .
So for me shopping is very enjoyable and I always forget about my problems when I try on new clothes , which suit to me .
But I do not like wasting my time too , so I usually do shopping in Mondays , because after the weekend shops are always empty .
Nowadays the technology and the society have changed in different ways and most people have more free time than years before .
This could be good , allthough some people say we need n't all this time and we have to work more .
First of all could be said that the society is spending more time doing relaxing things such as going to the beach or meet friends , and some experts say that we have to spend more time working or studying because people is becoming lazier .
In contrast , the technology have been becoming more useful and it could do works that we had to do some years ago and having more free time could be better for us .
Another point is that we can meet more friends or visit our family if we have more free time and that is allways good .
In other words could be said that if we have more free time our lifes would become better because we can enjoy with friends and do thigs with our family .
Frome my point of view , having free time is perfect because we can do more things that we are fond of and our quality of life would icrease
how things are going ?
You ca n't imagine how I 'm excited about tripping to the UK !
After all those letters we sent each other , now we can meet for real .
I 'm looking forward being there to spend some time with you .
I 've never been to London and what 's more I 'm scared of big cities , therefore I 'll literally stick to you wherever we 'll go !
I 've been searching for a lot of stuff we could visit once I got there , for example Piccadilly Circus .
At a glance it seems very original and particular , is n't it ?
I think it would be fascinating go sightseeing around there and I could find some souvenir for my family .
Oh and given you 're a huge soccer fan like I do , what about planning a match involving some friend of yours ?
If you manage to organize it beforehand I 'll have the time to prepare all soccer stuff ( boots etc . ) .
Shortly I 'll give you some other information .
When I was 17 I moved to Kyiv .
I study filology .
A few years ago I worked as literal editor .
Now I am working as a jornalist at National Radio .
You may ask why is that .
First of all I get less than 100 dollars for my work .
My programs are for the old people in different villages .
But instead I am writing abour stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .
Next year I 'll be a PHD .
I want to have kids and family .
I 'm trying to choose the best time for all these .
My country was attacked by Russia .
God , save us from the evil .
Friendship is one of the most valuable sentiments for people , especially for people who are in school days .
Making new friends and sharing interests with others are always exciting parts of social life .
When it comes to the best way for students to make friends , some support that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable , however , from where I am stand , joining a sports team is the undoubtedly the best choice .
First of all , for the energetic students , doing sports is their favorite .
Therefore , joining a sports team from where they can share same interests and relax is the easiest way to know each other .
Training in the same sports team , the students can not only release them from whole day 's pressure , but also can build up good relationships with others through the communication and exercise .
For example , the champions of Olympic Games , China 's famous synchronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia , the two girls enjoy a really good friendship .
They became to know each other because they both joined the same sports team , and then after exercised and played together ; they finally become two enviable friends .
Finally , joining a sport team will provide a long period of time for students to get along with each other .
However , if students participate in community activities , for example , doing volunteer job in the town 's library , they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is full of working .
Meanwhile , students can play with each other during traveling , but only several days are deficient and most people will not keep in touch with others after the trip .
How are you ? have you something new to tell me ?
Is everything ok with your family ?
Well , I have a good news for you ! I met a wonderful girl last weeck when I went to the cinema .
She has a wonderful body , but in her face you can see the perfection .
I want to introduce her assap !
My country 's media this year celebrated a doctor who works in Afghanistan .
He set up a hospital in Kabul to take care of the mine 's victims .
In my opinion he 's a hero of our times .
He left his job in a safe and comfortable Italian hospital to move in a country that lives a civil war .
He 's very brave to work in one of the most dangerous places of the Earth .
In my opinion we need to thank people like him .
I am writing to you , because I 've heard that you 're planning a trip to our city - Katowice .
We have so many interesting places to visit , but if I must limit to only one I chose the centre of the city .
It is renovating , but you can see many beautiful buildings .
First of all , I have to show you our theatre and if you want to , we can go on an art .
In this theatre perform fantastic actors and I would like you to see their best play which is " Jackyl and Hide " .
Besides btilliant actors they have incredible decor and it 's perfectly situated , that is very near to the bus stop .
I hope you 'll enjoy our city centre , there you can entertain and learn something about our city .
It is really interesting place and I think you 'll appreciate this .
In case of any questions , please , write me an e - mail I answer them with pleasure .
Yours faithfully ,
Some do not like but it is a personal business .
Some people go shopping to feel better for themselves .
If they have bad day or if they have a good day .
Tend to be people who are dependent on purchases .
I personally love to do shopping and spend my money for new clothes .

It 's placed in Rosario , Argentina .
It was built on June 20 , 1957 by the architect and engineer Angel Guido to celebrate the Flag Day .
In the same place where Manuel Belgrano first raised the Argentina flag on February 27 , 1812 .
Inside the " Monumento a La Bandera " you can see historical objects about the history of Argentina , in the underground it 's the hall of honor of American Flags .
If you want to enter to the hall of honor or enter to the monument it 's free but if you want to go up to the viewpoint , unless you are younger 5 , you must pay an entrance fee of 10 $ argentines .
Hate them or love them , villains are the funniest part in every story board .
Since I was a child , my favourite characters are being the cruellest one .
Obviously because in every story , book or movie , despite heroes are weaker than bad characters , they always win !
For example , in Terminator 's movies villain was always stronger and more equipped than hero , but at the end of the movie the righteous wins the battle .
Finally , latest movies are based on cruel , bad , dirty and strong character ! Enjoy them !
In recent years , social media sites have developed and interpenetrated our society as the essentials rapidly .
There are enormous numbers of users all over the world , and social media sites such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are utilized for acquiring some information , contributing ideas , sharing photographs and communicating between individuals , individuals and organization or between organizations .
While social media sites change our society more convenient and more comfortable as compared with the past , they simultaneously accompany some issues .
There are two advantages and a disadvantage of the current social consequences , and I mention conceivable effects of social media site in the future .
Before they start school they have to finish preschool .
Usually children go to kindergarten up to 5 years old , and after that they start preschool .
So if the child is born in the first few months of the year , parents can choose when their child will start school at 6 years and few months or 7 years and few months .
Most Bulgarian parents are not agree their children to start school at 6 years old .
However , Bulgarian government was thinking change the law so all children have to start at 6 years old .
I think I ca n't compare education of children in school or tertiary education between Bulgarian and Australia , because I still do n't have children and I am not studding in university in Australia .
Kortrijk is a small town , located in the northern part of Belgium .
Kortrijk is nearby the French border about 15 minutes by car .
The town has 100.000 inhabitants .
Ou
After a day of shopping , you can go at one of the many restaurants Kortrijk has .
You can choose between several types of food such as Japanese , Italian , French and many other food .
Of course you can eat the typically Belgian dish mussels with French fries .
In summer Kortrijk organises little concerts .
The last few years a lot of building has been done in the area .
Many green zones have been implemented .
We had a number of problems ; the first one is concerning the number of beds : You offered space to sleep for six persons so we excepted six bed , but we only had five .
So , two of us had to share one bed , which is hardly acceptable
The other problems is about the offered excursions : You promised a number of attractions , but two ( the walk up to the mountain as well as the visit of a historic castle ) were not available .
Unfortunately , we also had problems with nutrition : In your brochure it was told that we will have a number of restaurants around , but in fact there was only one which was , in addition to that , really expensive .
This is in our honest opinion not acceptable , because in the brochure you talked about more than one restaurant .
To sum it up : We were not very pleased with our holiday as we could not enjoy some of the things you promised to us in the brochure .
We are the opinion that you should not offer things which are in fact not available .
Yours sincerely ,
Anna Olsen and family .
How people 's lives will change in the future ?
It requires a rich imagination to try to put a view of the future , first of all the means of transport will change , depend mainly on the solar energy or the nuclear energy , a flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work , you will need to supply your car with spinache after they invent a spinache - using car .
Also the food will change in the future , capsules of your favourite foods will be available at the future in the mobile supermarkets , these capsules turn into your lunch as soon as you put a small amount of water on it .
In the future water will be very expensive to the extent that you will have to work three hours of overtime everyday to be able to pay for half a liter of clean water , but the one thing that will never change in the future is the smile on your mother 's face when you surprise her by cleaning your bedroom without using the robot that belongs to your older brother .
I think today 's television is still a good value , because there is more choice than ever before .
You can see whatever you want , whenever you want!There 's always something to watch for everybody .
Of course I think that we should n't watch too much television .
I think that 's the only negatieve point from today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
Some people just watch tv the whole day long , and stay in their houses .
They just ca n't stop watching television , because there 's just so much what they like to watch .
I think that we should promise ourselves that we just watch maximal 1 hour TV every day .
In that way , we can enjoy all that new technology from today , and all the enjoyable tv - programms !
On the background you can see the river Amur .
On the left you can see people on an observation area .
The city looks beautiful in this time .
By the way , in that day Everybodys were celebrating the Day of the City .
Afterwards we went for a walk .
We felt happy because we have not seen for a long time .
We used to engage in dancing and singing .
When we were schoolgerls we used to spend all our free time together .
Lots of modern messenger like WhatsApp , Skipy , Vier make it possible for us to talk , chart as much , as we want .

After so much time at school some people think they need a break .
On one hand , it is true that leaving school means passing from the basis to your future profession .
After sixteen years of continues work , it is the perfect moment to take a rest and enjoy your life by travelling .
To know about other cultures and get new knowledge completly different from school .
However it could be a great time to work and earn some money for paying university or simply for saving it .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break until university the routine of working and studing every day could break .
So when univerity starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and as a consecuences the marks will be lower .
to conclude , I think after school we need apply for university in order to continue working in what we like .
The year off should be taken after university studies
As the number of traffic accident has increased dramatically over the year , finding the best solutions has putted the government under pressure to whether implementing stricter penalties or using alternative regulations .
Personally , road safety can not be ensured with either former or later methods .
Nobody wants to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison , so fear of punishment might be effective and prevent people to make the offence a second time .
Its penalties , depends on the severity , could include fines , licence suspension , community services or imprisonment .
Consequently , those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only , therefore , minimize the amount of accidents .
By the same token , a sole method could not solve the traffic problems as driving offences are not the only reason that cause traffic accidents .
Authorities should enact more safety policy on road and ensure by improving the quality of traffic facilities .
In many developing countries , government rarely attach special important to both the quality and quantity of the traffic system , especially in rural areas .
People easily get accidents when driving in narrowed or severely damaged streets .
Furthermore , vehicle collisions are rising greatly due to number of unclear road signs .
Traffic education is also an compulsory measure , especially to young generations as they cover majority of offences .
People should be educated carefully about all the safety regulations and laws when they get driving licence , the more they know the rules , the less risks are taken on road .
In general , betterment of reducing traffic accidents is important .
Therefore , it should be considered carefully on how to combine both severe penalties and many other regulations .
However , the increasing number of car ownership has been taken place of public transportation , providing more convenience to get around places to places .
Traveling by cars gives flexibility in our schedule .
We do not have to concern to catch a bus or train at certain time .
We can get on a car whenever we want to go to places and drive .
Such convenience of cars can enables us to use our time efficiently .
However , cars can not take place of public transportations just for that convenience .
Maintaining cars is cost associative .
Driving a car requires to fuel gas , and gas prices are becoming more and more expensive .
In addition , cars require regular maintenance such as oil change and checking tire pressures .
Mechanical problems can often be a costly problems .
Unlike public transportation , one has to be responsible for his or her tool of transportation , and it could be expensive sometimes .
On the other hand , the public transportation is inexpensive .
Not to mention not everyone can afford keeping a car with their budget .
In other perspective , cars require to drive .
Driving is not everyone can do .
Children under certain age are not permitted to drive .
For those people , public transportation can be an optimal choice of transportation .
In conclusion , cars are convenient , however , it is not for everyone use .
Therefore , the public transportation has its own means of existence , and there is a future for public transportation .
Our congregation has carried educational family camps with the support of NNNs Integration programme for 8 years .
We have a hugeexperience in organising seminars and camps for families with disabled children .
For many of children participating in this camp is the only opportunity to spend time with the coevals and to feel fully - fledged members of the society .
Words fail to express emotions that all participants experience .
Health improvements of some children can be considered a miracle .
Reduction in financial support from foreign charity foundations leads to make our camp not possible to happen this year .
Our budget is fixed for only 75 people , it is almost twice a number of participants last year .
We do n't know and we do n't want to know how to refuse a participation in the camp to children in this situation !
The greater amount of money has already been collected thanks to the trustee board of " NNN " community , but we still need additional $ 13000 .
We are asking you not to stay indifferent to disabled children and to provide feasible help .
The idea that newspapers will diminish by time due to people 's perspective toward surfing the internet for the worldwide news does not necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted .
One of the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of the society deals with newspapers as a daily routine .
They ca n't withstand one day without skimming through their pages with a cup of tea in the morning .
To the best of my knowledge , it is a way of behaving more than a way coping with the latest technologies .
To begin , the reason for decreasing the popularity of news papers is that most people , recently , rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world .
On the other hand , newspapers are presented in a definite place , with limited time in addition they are daily payable .
It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectful reputation are the ones which could be accepted by thousands of people .
Furthermore , reading habits have their own taste , specifically for those elderly people .
That marvelous tasteful generation ca n't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences upon the modern society .
In light of the forgoing discussion , it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect toward globalisation even in daily news worldwide .
However , the newspapers still have their lead in that perspective .
It can be suggested that combination of both arenas will positively influence the ways of delivering news .
Last week one friend of mine told me about a new cafe that had just opened near my house and that she thought it was a magic place .
At first , I did n't belive that this place would be as amazing that she said .
I have to be honest and recommend all of you this magic place .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe , comfortable chairs and sofas , beatiful features and a really good - taste coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think in .
Althoug the most important thing is that there were not only friendy staff but they look like if they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
I strongly recommend this café if you want to enjoy an excellent coffee with a careful decoration and brilliant performances in which you can participate while having a drink .
I 'm 50 years old and I 'm living in a little city named Monza .
At my age is very important to keep fit so I ride twice a week .
This sport is not so hard , give me the opportunity to do an activity that is not too expensive and could be done outdoors and not in a closed sportshall .
When I came back from my job , in the afternoon , I wear something comfortable , take my bike and go away over the street alone with my thoughts and no one could disturb me .
Whenever I go out with my bike I stay on the way for two hours and I enjoy so much this time for myself that I 'll remain outside for ever .
For everyone who would like to start this sport is important to remember that you are alone with yourself and must have the power to improve the time you 'll stay out and never give up .
The visit is a movie in which two grandparents get to know his grandchildren for the first time .
They have never met his grandparents because her mom had a fight long time with them even before they both where born , that it caused not to know more about each other .
The girl is making a film for a school project about the journey about knowing his grandparents .
Then both kids realize that something is going wrong with them .
because sometimes they start acting really weird and after 9:30 pm weird things happen to them , then both kids understand that his grandparents are hiding a really big secret .
I think this thriller will get your nerves out of you , the movie reveals many things as it continues it 's actually so good and for those that are scared about thrillers , this movie is more like suspense and I really think you can enjoy it .
When facing a decision on whether to shop in a shopping center or in small stores , many people will choose the shopping center because you can buy all types of products at once .
Others , including myself , believe that shop in small stores is the premium choice .
First , small stores provide products with more unique feature and different selection .
That is to say , most small stores may have their own logos on mugs or even T - shirts and it is more likely to find handmade products in it .
For instance , my friends once bought a nice scruff with cute animal figure in a small store and I really like it after she showed me .
Therefore , the next day she brought me back to the store , we found out that they did not have the same scruff because it is the only one .
Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores , you can always find something unique .
Second , it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together .
However , most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive .
In conclusion , I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting .
The changes on television are evident , it could be because the society are changing too .
If tv 's programmes are a lot of rubbiss , is because some people prefer those .
So , we have to take care of it .
Maybe , there are a lot of repeats of old programmes , but some of them are still watched for a long number of people .
And sometimes , programmes are so aggressive and gives people bad messages .
On the other hand , there is some channels , which show documentaries and programmes about specific subjects like science , math or history .
And there are musical channels too .
I think there are good tv 's programmes , but people do n't give them the value that they should have .
The television has still something important to show .
I am writing to congratulate on the excellent Dumplings Festival which I attended in Cracovie last November .
I spend a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concering the organisation .
I was far from impressed by all dumplings which housewives prepared .
In my opinion dumplings with spinach tasted great .
I am impressed a cabaret who performed during the festival .
Them jokes were very funny .
However , there are a couple of small sugestions .
First of all , the vanue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
It could be a good idea to find a large location .
I saw a parents with children but kids did not have many attractions .
I would like to suggest fire special animators wgo will entertain kids .
In addiction tickets were too expensive .
you should think about reducing proces or prepare special discount for xample for students .
Once again please accept my compliments on a job well done I hope you find my suggestions helpful and I look forward toa n even more successful event next year .
Yours faitfully
These days , the use of technology is increasing , especially robots .
According to Russell and Norwing robots are especial machines that have intelligence to executed activities on their own or by command ( as cited in Chijindu & Inyiama , 2012 ) .
They represent an innovation that has changed the world in distinct ways and have implanted in different areas of society ; for example in security , health , army forces , education , industries and agriculture .
More accurate surgeries , emotional bond and increase of communication are examples of positive consequences .
Negative impacts such as the human dependence on robots for doing basic activities and pollution of environment can be cited .
This essay will describe the positives and negatives social consequences of the robots , and possible implications in the future .
Each day , the environment suffers different problems caused by the global warming and human are the unique guilty of this issue .
We need to analyze and investigate the main problems to find solutions which may get better our world .
First of all , transport is the most relevant carbon dioxide 's emitter .
As we know , in all cities a lot of cars are used every day unnecessarily .
Probably , if we used up public transport like bus instead of private , we would reduce the greenhouse effect because of the CO2 produced .
Secondly , the huge amount of litter floating in the rivers and sea 's water destroys the ecosystem and has a high visual impact .
Sometimes , cities get rid of rubbish throwing it to the water .
Last , I 'll propose a solution of a common and near problem .
Reusing things that we do n't utilize ( like clothes , furniture … ) and give them a ' second life ' .
I think we must be down to earth and creative to cut down our daily trash 's production .
To sum up , it 's necessary to solve the environmental problems to keep safe our planet , so we had better start resolving closer issues .
If we avoid them , the earth will get worse .
I 'm happy that you wrote me to ask some advice .
Well , to travel there in Brazil , you have to choose some places to go , because here we have a lot of beautiful places to visit and have fun .
To help you , I need to know what do you prefer to do .
If you want to go to the beach , I 'll tell you to visit the Northeast 's beaches because there are the most beautiful beaches in the entire world .
You have to pass some days in Fernando de Noronha .
For these places , the best season is the Summer .
One other place to visit in Summer is the pantanal .
There you will see one of the most beautiful biome that you have seen .
In pantanal the weather ir hot and wet , and we can drive into the river deeper in the wood and see the wild animals like the alligators .
If you want to come here in the Winter , you have to know the South .
There , you will see beaultiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice wine factories .
For work , I advise you came to Sao Paulo .
Here , you 'll find most of kinds of temporary job , like in restaurants , bars , etc .
I hope that I helped you and see you soon .
Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese no one of those languagues are so popular as English is .
Over 1 billion people around the world speak English as a second language because of that it is considered the universal language .
Nowadays , it is an obligation to get a better job .
Even though , study a language become easier because of the internet , fluency is harder to get when you study by yourself .
Brazillians need learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
In Brazil , regular schools teach for students the basic aspects of the language and do not let them emerge in the language .
It can explain a little bit of Brazil 's lack of English speakers .
Learn English as a foregein language will make a huge impact in brazillians ' professional life to get a better position .
To conclude , Brazil has deficiency of English speakers .
The brazillian educational system should be aware to develop more students ' language skills .
Learn English as a second language will help brazillians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
To the national championships in swimming , she was preparing since last summer .
After all , this is a hard work from an early age and on the list of players does not enter by accident .
But the daily duties , which she had as a teenager , and the murderous workouts till midnight , built in her the strong will to fait .
She knew that besides her , the race will be attended by the best girls from all over the country .
Dressed in a swimsuit , she was waiting in front of a swimming pool for the next judges command .
Only a few seconds separated her from the jump to the water .
The judge ordered to take place at the sites .
Anna looked again toward the audience , where her the best fans in the world were sitting - her parents , friends , coach and friends .
They all were keeping their fingers crossed .
She swam so fast , like a former fish , not a human being .
In the water she feels like at home .
Only after a while , after a few quick and short breaths occurred to her that she fulfilled her biggest dream .
Anna won first prize , regained confidence .
It was one of the happiest day of her life .
I am not as patient as a teacher has to be with all his students although only some of them are naughty .
Many of my friends are teachers , they like their job despite the fact that they often have to deal with lively children or lazy students and heavy parents .
Teaching could be a stimulating working environment for students and teachers if it involved a rewarding career and the improvement of teaching skills .
First , it is necessary for my job ; second it is my hobby .
My pronunciation is not always correct , as a result I have some problems with listening . I know English economic terminology very well but my everyday English is rather poor .
I score 56% in my last test .
I enjoy visiting museums , travelling in my free time .

It is said that no future for public transportation . I think it when I was young , but it is changed while I am getting older .
But it is changed recently , I fell down and hurt my knee , so that I can not drive by myself .
There are a lot of benefits by developing public transportation .
Most developed countries developed the public transportation system to low the impact of growing population .
Shared cost let the huge expense on developing and building the public system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally .
Public transportation is proved less energy consumption .
I still think the public transportation system will be growing on in such a crowded era .
How long haven't you use public transportation ? do you agree that there is no future for public transport ?
I personally think so , the reasons are as below :
First , As we all know , Cars play a very important role in our life , the more and more cars come into our family .
Also travelling , of course , that 's a big part of the function of the car !
The very well developed highways , roads , city streets provide a good foundation for the cars , look at the North America , the highways were developed anywhere , it 's really your own lose if you do n't drive a car , drive on them(highways )
Second , Human start to learn driving at the age of 16 , and they can master the driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) , soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it .
so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore ?
Third , The public transportation sucks , when you think about it , you can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind .
The wasted time also should weight in , whether it is waiting for the trains , or waiting for the delayed buses , not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car .
And driving your own car can be very convenient too , it can right come to your own garage .
All in all , Public transport is not as fast as a car can be ; it 's not as convenient as a car can provide , so it 's future is in doubt .
Firstly , no one like to be sad .
Life is full of good things why do n't we look to the full side of the cup instead of looking at the empty one ?
All of this will affect your life badly , maybe you will lose your job or your health will not be good anymore .
Secondly , Eveybody seeks safetiy in their lives .
Look around you , crimes and death are srounding us , all this people are dreaming to live a peaceful life without all the aspects of killing and sadness .
People are fighting as they can to only reach a calm life where everyone of them can be safe .
Thirdly , I lived two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
The war in my country make me feel no longer safe .
For that reason I beleive that being safe is absloutly better than sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that the life will go on and oneday all of us will be satsfied with this life .
In conclusin , I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy , because you live a calm life without anything makes you sorry .
If I could change places for 24 hours with a famous person , I would like to be Paula Echevarria
I start telling something about Paula Echevarria , she is a very pretty and famous actress , she also writes in a fashion blong , she is 34 years old and she is married with David Bustamente who is a popular and hadmesome singer in Spain , they have a daughTer , her name is Daniela and they are like a perfect family .
I have chosen Paula because she is popular , famous , rich and she has the perfect husband but above all I choose her because she is friendly , intelligent and she is always smiling .
Therefore she has everything good aobut being a celebrity but the most important is that she is a great person .
Let me conclude by saying that I would like to be Paula for one day because Not only is she a good professional but also a wonderful role model to be followed by everyone .
I would like to talk about my hobby of breeding birds , this hobby is very pleasant to me and also for many people , especially when you have different kind of singing birds like canary or finches … .
This hobby give me pleasure and good sense of nature , especially when I wake up with the sound of the singing birds in my house .
At present , I have three kinds of birds , one of them is yellow canary , the second one is finch , and the third one is combination of two kinds of birds , Each bird has his own special voice .
I 've started this hobby since 2007 , and since then I have tried to have many different kinds of the singing birds , I spent one day in the week to take care of them , feeding them , cleaning the cages , change the water .
I would like to recommend this hobby to many people , because it give us the sense of nature , and fills the house with the joy and happiness .
By increasing the veriety of cars with new technolgy , people 's demand hasnt ' stop .
But are these new comers will be placed by public transport ?
As technology enhanced the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it beacuse of many different attractions that these cars have .
Another reason for using their own car is that easy access in a second .
Furthure more , there are advantages travelling by a car , like seeing the scenery and also the costs is less in compare to plane .
But it 's not possible that every one have and use their own car .
In this case there will be a huge chaos .
Trafic jam will cost a lot , such as pollution which certainly cause more health problems and will make expense not only for us but for the others as well .
The solution is public transport again , which enhance the pace of life and make easy accsess by subways and special roads .
On the other hand , by increasing the population we should revise the regulation with the fast pace of technology .
To sum up , as thought the cars are too covenient to some extend , but the cost will reduce the benefit .
So for sure we will use public transport but maybe with some changes .
I am writing in response to your advertisment for the job in USA summer camps .
I am 25 years old and have just finished the university as a sport teacher .
Furtheremore during my studies at University I have worked in 2 projects based on sports activities for children aged 7 - 13 , organising them .
Except from that I am getting well with children and have no problems to work in the kitchens to .
This job would give me the opportunity to pactise my skills and get more experience with children as well .
I am free for the job from the 20 of May until the 15 of September .
I am looking forward to hear from you .
Your sincerely ,
For this reason , school of English are opening in all the big cities as well in most towns .
Studying English in your country let you continue working or studying without change your habits .
In fact , usually there is just one class per week , and it is not enough without studying by itself during the week .
Studying English abroad is the better alternative , but it have advantages and disadvantages .
On one hand , living abroad will be probably non cheap , so it could be needed to find a job , but it would be at the same time an advantage : working with English people would help you improve quickly your speaking and listening .
On the other hand , living abroad you 'll need to speak English all the time and you 'll have the opportunity to learn English in a short time , and in a not boring way .
So probably , if you have the opportunity to stay abroad several months , you should do it , to learn English and live a different experience .
In order to improve the time you spend on it we will recommend you to star in one of ours malls where you can find at your disposal several facilities , from the most fashionable shop to the most traditional .
First of all , coming to a mall will help you to deal with them , also , we have to rate positively the wide range of services you can find here : restaurants , coffee shops and some free areas to spare .
Another advantage is that you will find most of the shops you can find in the city centre but you wo n't get lost while you search them .
For all of you who have kids you will also be interested in the different areas which take care of them for free as much time as you need .
I would strongly recommend this at the nap time to allow them to relax , otherwise you will have to leave sooner than you expected .
In conclusion , you will save , time , money and a foot ache so accept my advice and try to enjoy the rest of the time of the city .
I am going to write about a short story that I have read from the book : And all for love .
title : The kimono .
Written By Herbert Ernes Bates .
The plot is about a man , Arthur , twenty - five yeras old , engaged to a nice girl .
Arthur went to London to an appointment for a job interview .
The company requested him to go back three days later , so he was looking for a hotel that someone had recomemded him .
He Forgot his engagement and went to live with Blanche .
But all was not as wonderful as the expected .
twenty - five years later he regrets his decision and wonders what would have happened if he had not met Blanche .
I chose this story because even though this novel was written in the early twentieth century , the underlying theme , is still current today .
And also I would like to highlight that reflects the importance of every decision we make and how it can change our future .
" Atacama 33 " is a recent American movie that tells the real story of a group of miners that keep trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months .
This group had a leader called Mario Casas starring Antonio Banderas .
The film is well - developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that miners had to go through .
However the first 17 days in the movie could turn a bit tedious because the director focused in every single feeling of the trapped men and their families .
After that lapse the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment for rescue them started .
The characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involve with the real accident .
Antonio Banderas made an excellent work acting as a desperate leader committed with the local people .
Despite some details , I think you ca n't miss this film if you want to know the truth of the recent miracle called " the Chilean miners " .
It is universaly known that shopping is not always enjoyable .
However , other people think in the opposite direction .
Everyone know that shopping is a good way to spend time and get positive emotions or just relax .
Even though shopping can make bad affect on our health especially we can feel tired or exhausted in the end of hard day .
At the same time there are one more opinion that shopping is always enjoyable .
People declare that shopping can make our mood better what in consequence will make as fun .
As for me I do n't agree with these people .
Quite often in the shopping centre is not enough air and as the result you can get a headache or just feel bored .
In conclusion I would like to say that there are different views about shopping and it 's not surprise because we are all different .
Internet has been developed a lot for the last years , and we can use easily for doing any tasks .
But it is a good invention for the world ?
To answer these questions we have to analyze giving some positive and negative arguments .
On the positive side , the use of internet helps us to find easily and quickly a lot of information that talk about all the topics .
What is more , we can only have to press one computer key to find what we are searching .
For this reason the most people have Internet at home .
On the negative side , the use of Internet can be a waste of time in our lives ; this happens because although search is faster , we can distract looking at other things on account of the attractive of the Internet .
Following the above argument , this is the danger of spend hours and hours surfing the web and not being in real world enjoying the live .
If not , it could be a waste of time that can produce the opposite meaning of enjoying the life .
Nowadays it is very frequent to meet new person coming from abroad who speak different languages and speak about their home countries .
This makes us curios to learn more about foreign countries and their cultures .
But to learn new cultures we must know their languages , especially if we want to travel .
Due to globalization there are more and more multinational companies that require employees who can speak at least fluent English but if a candidate knows more languages he can have more career chances and achieve top level positions .
In my opinion it is very important to speak several languages not only for above reasons but also to train brain , to have the opportunity to find a job abroad and , why not ?
, To have more fun with friends whom we now in our summer holidays abroad .
Unfortunately it is very difficult to learn foreign languages when we are adult so it is extremely important to teach and to study them since kindergarten age .
The doorbell rang insistetly , It was Saturday , in the earlier morning and I still was in bed .
The last low sound of the doorbell finished to wake me up."I am not dreaming " I thought , ¿ Who is ringing at this time?Then I jumped out of the bed and went down fast the upstairs .
I still was in pyjama , so I did n't open the door fast .
First I asked " ¿ Who is ringing so early?¿What 's happen?Suddenly , a family voice shouted me throughout the door .
You do n't think opening the door at your little brother¡Oh brother!I shouted and I ran to open de door .
What are you doing here ?
and He held me strongely .
What amazing surprise!I was very emocional and was about to cry .
But You were in Ireland , What are you doing here?I wo n't expect you .
I would want to do a surprise sister!I miss you .
It is sometimes very hard for me .
Oh I miss you too and I was looking forward to you .
I'm very excited because of you are here .
It 's for three months since I was in Ireland visiting you .
I hope you are a lot of time now with me .
I'm on holiday school .
I believe it is amazing the project that you are doing .
In answer to your question about the use of internet beyoung people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information easier and quiker .
Although , it plays a freat role in removing the borders on nations , in a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just talking to a friend .
Nowadays , the Internet is very useful , it has many ways of helping people such us with their homework , using Google , or entertainment websites like Youtube , emails websits such as Hotmail , and the number one social network site , Facebook .
Evidently , we can not imagine how much time we spend online , because we are the whold day connecting , in our houses , moviel phones and computers at work .
My favourite way to travel is by train because I love watching scenery through the windows .
I think it is a bohemian trip too because the train use to be one of the most appreciated means of transport in the literacy .
I feel better when I travel over ground because I have fear of heights .
Although experts say the plane is the safest means of transport , I continue thinking It is very dangerous .
Probably , I 'm afraid of planes because the media use to show plane accidents more often .
In conclusion , my main problem is the concern about how safe is the means of transport that I take , so , the train let me to be more relaxed than other ways to travel .
It 's a sport where two teams play on a court , which is separated for a central net .
The players have got a ball which has to cross at the other side .
The ball , usually is hit with hands and arms , but also with any part of body .
A feature of the volleyball is that the players have to rotate their positions while they are getting points .
In fact , I enjoy playing volleyball because it is a fun sport which you can practise with a lot of people , eleven people concretely .
I suggest at the new players of volleyball that they have to start step to step .
It 's a sport that looks like easy , but you can injure easily .
Put comfortable clothes and suitable shoes .
Young people may confront some health issues , making bad choices , like for drugs and alcohol and also a negative body image , including crash dieting , eating disorders and obesity .
Nowadays they have to work through a lot of issues while they are in their adolescence , they begin to have lack of self - esteem , depression , social pressure , and all this can cause a lot of problems .
I 'm going to write about the obesity , a lot of people do n't eat correctly , they consume a lot of junk food and this cause effects in their health .
They have to realice that if they continue eating that way and not doing any exercise they are more likely to have differents diseases .
Maybe a lot of people that are fat do n't have the time to do exercise , or they have other reasons , but that is not an excuse , they have to have the habit of eat healthy food .
Another problem is like the junk food is really cheap , even cheaper that the healthy food , and people prefer to buy something cheaper and that 's a big problem .
They need to create a new lifestyle habit to reduce the obesity and have a better body image , they should have a healthy eating , and physical activity .
I went to a workshop about the light controlled synthesizer .
To get to the place they were holding the workshop in you had to come to the Chester Beatty library and then the guides arrived and led you to it .
On the way there everyone who participated in the workshop stopped to buy some snacks .
When we reached the workshop the kids and I were told to put on protective glasses and given booklets with the instructions .
We were instructed to make a badge that flashed different coloured light by using solder to attach the led and battery hatch to the badge .
At first I was quite confused but then one of the instructors came and helped me out .
After that we had a snack and then went on to assemble all the parts together .
When the light sensor is in the shade , the synthesizer emitts a lower pitch , and when the sensor is exposed to light the synthesizer 's pitch raises .
I worked as an Advocate ( Solicitor ) for a period more than four years and from those jobs I gained lots of experiences about minute taking , dealing with clients , arranging meetings and handling cases .
I am a proficient user of Microsoft office packages .
In my first placement I had to deal with lots of cases relating to violation of children rights .
I worked voluntarily for some cases about Juvenile justice like ( speedy disposal of cases , abuse of their rights while they were under custody , custodial death etc . )
I worked on a project about how education the fundamental rights for children under 14 years of age is denied in some community .
This job is related to subject of my interest .
I my second placement I had to perform lots of administrative work including typing .
I had to work as a liase with clients as well as the company officials ( since Shriram Law Consultants is a part of Shriram Group of Companies ) .
The article and the lecture are about the attitude towards taking medical experiments on animals .
The lecturer opposes this idea , as , in her point of view , medical experiments on animals are not to be taken .
Firstly , the author informs us about impossibility to discover new types of drugs .
The lecturer answers back , saying that different types of medicine have different impact on different species .
Thirdly , the author considers such tests to keep animal suffering to a minimum .
The lecturer argues that as a biologist she used to see animals suffering without appropriate amount of anesthesia .
The topic of the two passages is about future use of hydrogen based fuel - cell engine .
The article states that the most efficient substituer of internal - combustion engines will be fuel - cell engines , because of their several advantages , while the lecture refutes this point by stating hydrogen does not have so many advantages .
First of all , the reading passage says that internal - combustion engine relies on petroleum , which will be depleted soon , but hydrogen will not deplete easily .
The professor contends this point by explaining that hydrogen is , in fact , not easily found .
She adds that it is not directly usable , because hydrogen should be obtained in pure liquid state , which technologically is very hard to be kept under -200 degrees celsius .
Secondly , the article states that this hydrogen use will solve pollution problems , inasmuch as it does not use carbon dioxide , but water .
The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem , because it requires to be purified in order to be used .
She explains that in the process of purefication , a big amount of coal and oil is burned , which pollutes factories rather than the environment .
Finally , the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economic , because it requires only half of the energy of internal - combustion powered cars .
The professor says that the claims in untrue , because the material , from which the cells are produced , is very expensive .
She explains platinum is very hard to find and without this metal it is impossible to produce hydrogen .
I am a fairly calm person and I am interested in reading every kind of books therefore I have a quiet life .
It means that after some months I was able to read the sheet music .
But a few months before the play , disaster occurred !
My sister had fallen down her bike and hurt her wrist .
The teacher said to me ' Could you play in the place of your sister ?
I was absolutely terrify as I had to show .
As a result I spent the time playing the piano until I felt far more confident .
The day of the concert I was so nervous that I could n't stop walking .
At the end of the play , everybody applauded , never felt I so well .
I am going to play definitely the piano for a long time .
One of the person who I admire is Martin Luther King .
He was a pastor of Bautist Church and he fought against the dicrimination of black people in the Unated States in the 60 's .
He founded the movement for the civil rights and to free a black people to the racial segragation and equality .
He participated a lot of times on the meeting , like a leader , he went against the law for several times .
He had decided not use the violence in this kind of movements , because he was concentrated about fought against the Vietnam War and poverty .
The other reason for Martin Luther King was the right to vote for the afroamerican people .
One of his most famous speeches was " I have a dream " , where he discrives the equality of the society beetwing waith and black people , where all people can live together .
He was murder in 1968 , in Menphys , he was 39 years old .
Most people are satisfied with shops in my town in spite of being quite small .
However , the relation between quality and price of the products are believed to be the most essential points to visit Cáceres .
In general , shops are condensed in a specific zone so that tourists can find what they are interested in very easily .
In general , tourists think shops should be opened during middayas they are foreigners and like to buy things after watching sights around the city .
It is thought that the best shops in Cáceres are found in the ancient town as it has a medieval charming which involves visitors in that moment of the time .
Overall , the majority of the tourists prefer to buy typical products from the region and besides it is very enjoyable to taste a meal in San Juan Square while people walk around to see the main clothes shops situated in the main street before to go to the heritage town .
I 'm glad to read you and I wish you to come to Russia for you holidays .
In our country there are few different climate zones with very rich nature , various cities with old and prominent history and culture .
As you know , Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation , it 's a very fast , energetic city with lots of things to do and to see .
In the city there are a lot of museums and art galleries , theaters and clubs , few parks which priveds different events like open - air concerts or public muster - classes .
I strongly recommend you to book on - line tickets to Big Theater and visit it 's opera or ballet .
Maybe you remember the famous Diagelev 's seasons which were popular in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century .
Nowadays artists of the Theater try to keep that old school and develop their mastery .
In addition , few years ago the Big Theater was restored and had gained it 's original appearance .
There is no necessity to describe all sightseeing in Moscow , you easily can find it in the Internet , I just want to say that I 'm sure , you 'll like it a lot .
After Moscow you can visit town of the Gold Ring .
It 's a range of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history .
Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia .
You will understand that people here and there are very different and styles of their lives are dissimilar .
You know last week Alex and I went to my favorite band concert , it was really fun , the whole band line up played about an hour and a half , it seemed to me like just a few minutes .
People were really excited about the show they just has three attire changes but the show was amazing , the lights and the sound was fantastic .
I could n't wait to listen to my favorite song until they played it , it was the best experience ever , I wish you could be there to see that .
Hope you have the chance to see each other next month .
Wtite soon
IT 'S BEEN SO A LONG TIME SINCE WE WROTE TO EACH OTHER .
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NAPLES AND I HOPE THEY'LL BE USEFUL .
I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU GETTING A TAXI BECAUSE IT 'S TOO EXPENSIVE .
I THINK THAT THE EASIEST METHOD OF TRANSPORT FOR YOU IS THE UNDERGROUND ; NEAR THE TRAIN IN GARIBALDI SQUARE THERE IS THE UNDERGROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO CATCH AND YOU HAVE TO GET OFF IN CHIAIANO STATION . I'LL BE AT CHAIANO STATION SO WE WILL TAKE A WALK UNTIL MY HOME .
ABOUT THE WEATHER I CAN SAY THAT NOW IS STILL HOT , BUT NEXT MONTH WILL BE COLDER , SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD PUT SOME SWEATERS IN YOUR LUGGAGE , AND ALSO SOME HIGH HILLS BECAUSE WE'LL GO TO THE DISCO !
However , as educational institutions , universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help them develop academically and socially .
let us look at an example for a univesity student .
The student had a great deal of assighment and projects , so he spent more time to access the libabry , becoming more ambition to study books and using a computer to search latest information .
Sometimes he felt tired to do papers , going the gym to play basketball .
Therefore , not only did he get high score in the reports that absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at the libabry , but reduce the study stress and maintain healthy in the gym .
I had a similar experience .
when I studied in the university , I sit in the classes hour by hour in a day .
When I finished classes , I would like to access the health center not only to do exercises , but I could maintain healthy .
University , I also have a lot of assighments , so I like to go to libabry to study where is more quietly , spacious and internet accessible .
That 's why I like to go to school in terms of good facilities and widespread information to facilitate me to be a successful person .
In addition , my academics education also stand out in my student life .
For these reasons , I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social movements to prepare students for their future development .
I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academics as well as sports and social activities .
It is a great life stage but at the same time is difficult , sometimes teenagers have problems with their families , with themselves , as a result they do n't know whah to choose .
Many times when people leave high school and they go to University , they realised after several months that the career they had chosen it is not for them .
In the other hand when teenagers take a year off is helpful for them to become mature .
You can work , travel , going to an exchange study , rest and do something that you are interested .
A lot of people think is a waste of time , but that is not true .
When students enter University after they have taken a year off fewer people leave the career after several months because they know themselves better .
I 'm interesting in doing a course in your school .
I have an intermediate level and I 'd like to speak English better because my pronunciation is n't very well .
My grammar and writing are good but as I 've said early my pronunciation is awful .
I 'm available to start the course immediately and I want both an eight - week intensive course and an one - month summer course in August , when I 'll be on holiday and besides I 'd like to learning in small groups because the teacher can focus on his pupils better .
In my spare time I like reading English books and going to the shopping with my mother .
Twenty years ago , no one would think of the inventions of Ipad or smarthphone and how they could change our lives , but today , these items have become the necessities of our daily lives ; nowadays , many people just got into the habit of carrying their smartphones no matter where they go .
Advent of science , whether it is in the scientific research or in the designs of consumer products , has changed our lives and will definitely keep changing our lives in the future .
Ipad , smartphone , genetic food engineering , all of them have one thing in common -they changed our lives dramatically .
Take genetic engineering as an example , on the one hand , it helps farmers to produce more corps and meats , on the other , it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways in producing more corps and poultry in the future , resulting in an unprecedent increase in human population , which brings pollution to the environment .
To cope with the problems of over - population and pollution , people need to dramatically change their lives in the next 50 years : they may , among other things , face tight birth control and environmental protection measures imposed by the government .
It is sad to say that the future generations have no choice but have to adapt to the changes in order to survive .

yours sincerely ,
The film tells about a movie shooting and adventures of filming team which is in Bolivia .
They try to make a film which explains how Christoph Colomb conquered to America and mention about what Colomb 's aims were .
They come across with some problems while they are shooting the film and this supply quite a few strong highlights .
The both of them are imperialism and poverty .
Actually , they want to describe the history of discovery and conquest by a critical perspective but while shooting the film , appear some protests against the privatization of water and the team fall into a chaos and then film starting to give some social , politic messages .
The messages are very important which effect me .
The private companies try to keep public 's all water which is vital to live , rain is in danger ; Even the rain …
The crucial point is transformations and exprerienced contradictions of the characters .
In our imperialist and capitalist World , we need more films or arthistic influences which mention the problems about our life and realities .
If the government provide good transport infrastructure like modern and comfort buses , traffic free Metro lines then people would rather to use public transport than travelling by car .
Now a days worlds are facing the big issues like climate change and carbon emission .
Government should promote the good mode of transport in order to reduce carbon emission and people would be encouraging to go green .
Many times because of huge traffic congestion on road we waste our time . while using public transport like Metro save our times .
There are many city in world , planning to car free days and promote to use of public transport .
In this fast - moving world , shopping is the one of the most important things but I strongly believed it is not always enjoyable .
First , shopping complexes are full of branches of big chain - stores , so this can be boring to walk through them for a long time .
Second , if you ca n't control your shopping habits , you will buy more and more things you do n't need , so that you can have a problem with your budget .
In my opinion there is the reason that shopping is not always enjoyable and full of pleasure .
You never know what you are going to find when you are reading ( or writing ) and less if you are doing it on the Internet .
There are such an interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would have never expected or unsurprisingly , missinformation .
We now that making social contacts can be sometimes a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and dauting experience .
In my experience , being under the screen of a personal computer will you be able to show and exchange ideas or opinions easily as if you have to do in front of someone else .
However , both readers and writers not only do it as an altruistic and philantropic way but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to became famous if they really appeal to a large amount of people and they will abe also available to earn money thanks to the publicity .
Consequently , we should never blind trust in everything we see or read on the Internet .
To give an example , I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series , characters , new seasons and when they will be ready to watch them again .
If they give us reliable information or not , it usually depends on the source .
That 's the point of Internet .
You must n't take everything into account .
To clarify what the situation is , it is truth that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites but the fact is writing or reading in a blog could give to people a practical way to communicate and share preferencies , beliefs or thoughts , however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Firstly I want to explain why those words came to Peter 's head .
He was hunting a hot day in summer in the country near Monfrague with Jon , a friend from Madrid .
Jon did n't use to go to the countru , so he did not know how to walk over the stones and he was afraid .
After to drink water form the bottle , he fell over the gress and Peter saw that Jon 's leg was broken .
There was a lot of blood and was then when Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He thought that they must go at the Hospital quickly , so Jon would have a great problem if he lost more blood .
Finally Peter ran to the car and went to pick Jon up .
Two hours later they were in the room of urgency of Cáceres Hospital and the doctors were curing Jon ' leg .
If Peter did not had run , perhaps Jon should have die

On our hotel there was like a water park , it was enormous .
That trip made me a lot of friends , I 'm still holding the contacts with them and this trip was two summers ago .
We all liked it so much so we are thinking going back there sometime .
there was this amazing beach , we could hire paddle boards , snorkel gear , kayaks and other fun water things . and one day my mom and I went out early and hired a kayak and went out on the water and we saw sea turtles .
I had hired a snorkel gear and a water camera , so I took pictures of sea turtle on the bottom .

Visiting museums is essential parts of their travel to new places for many people .
Besides seeing touristic or historical places , and attending open air activities people also want to see museums of the city they visited .
Because museums offer so many interesting and different things differ from other places in the visiting city .
First of all , people visit museums to learn history of the visiting city . We know that museums generally established to expose special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to expose modern belongings .
For example , when you go to Metropolitan museum of art in New York city , you can see lots of historical monuments and items belong to American history and also other countries ' history .
Observing these items you can get idea about the old times of the visiting place .
Secondly , museums are places from where you can learn culture of the visiting city .
Many items in museums has cultural value beside historical value .
For instance art museums include art collections such as paintings from many different artists .
Some of them were made in modern style and some of them in classic .
You can get idea the culture of the city from these paintings .
Third advantage of visiting a museum is that you can have fun visiting a museum .
Beside historic and cultural characters , some museums also can be source of fun including attractive activities .
If you bored to see classic museums you can go to thematic museums such as natural history museum .
There you can see dinasours from old ages .
It can be amazing to see different sprecies of animals which are no more live .
In sum , museums are attractive places for tourist to discover about the city they visited .
By visiting museums we can learn interseting details about the history and culture of that society .
In addition to having lots of information we also can have fun to see interesting things in the museums such as huge dinasours . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you travel .
I ca n't agree with a statement that there is no future for public transport .
Today plenty of ecology organisations are trying to raise people 's awareness of the environment defilement .
They say it is caused by burning oil , so the society demands itself to enclose it .
But while living in a big city , where there are lots of bus stops , tram stops or metro stations is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck at a block while rush hours .
Increasingly people prefer to use public transport rather than to drive a car for these reasons .
And now , when cities are widening , public transport will be more important than ever .
The importance of internet on our lives
The last decades there has been an massive change been in our lives , this is caused by the development of internet .
This had been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on the social life .
In these days a lot of student are using the internet as a study tool .
There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find publications of researchers around the world .
The internet is getting important for our study because of the availability of information sources .
The greatest impact of internet on our lives is the use of social media .
Almost everybody have at this moment at least one account on a social media like Facebook or LinkedIn .
The positive effect is that it is possible to be in contact with your friends and family whenever wherever .
One of the downsides you are not able to get away from your bully .
This could drive someone crazy and very miserable .
The greatest impact of internet on our life is the use of social media because you can get in contact with everybody around the clock .
The internet has a lot of consequences on our lives .
It makes it possible to study and do research easier .
Also it gives the possibility to get in contact with family and friends .
I think we should use internet carefully and keep use it with cautious .
In my life there are too many sports i like to but there is one in particular that i love so much .
It is the football .
when i was born i saw my father watching every day football 's programmes but i did n't understand what it was .
However , overtime i begun to understand how to play and i liked it much more than the past .
In fact when i was sixteen years old i begun to go to the stadium with my friends every sunday .
In italy , football is the most followed sports , specially in my town where played the most important player of the world : Diego Armando Maradona .
He wins two national championships and also an important european competition .
Every day in my town people speak only about football becouse it could give you a lot of emotions .
A football match is something special and you don t see the time that arrive sunday to watch your favourite club s match .
On the other hand , my advice that i give to someone who start this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsability and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
Nowadays , most people go by car every day instance of using public transport .
Is it the best for the pollution and environment ?
In the morning everyone goes to their job by car but I think that the real reason to do this is that we need to do a lot of things durind the day and with public transport we spend more time than doing the same with our own vehicle .
But , I think that in other cases we take the car without any reason , it 's only a bad habit and maybe we could be changed it to improve our health ( going on foot or taking the bike for example ) and also we will help to the environment and the pollution .
For example , I 'm a commuter and also I need my car to pick up my daughter from the school in the afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't like the traffic then when I get away from the hustle and bustle of the city I usually go to my village .
The car in my quiet village is not necessary and I feel really happy there .
Hello guys , my name is Matteo Davide and I love lot of things in my life , but the most important is one : play tennis .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport because I 'm an individualist , so I prefer individually sport , because in these kind of game everything depends from you .
In others sports no .
For example during a foorball match if you wrong is n't too important because you have a team which can remedy , evin if ypu do nothing .
An other reason for loving this sport is that having a racket in hands , for me , is beautiful .
If you want start playing this sport remember that when you are playing every points are important and you must n't relax during the match , even if you are winning with a very big advantage because in a few minutes you could lose the match .
I am writing to you to raise an important issue concerning school library .
For many years we , pupils , have been waiting for library .
Together with an unofficial Student council create a petition which is to raise the issue among teaching council .
Our priority is good preparation for secondary school certificate .
For this purpose we need a quiet place to learn .
Moreover pupils demand is the possibility to borrow books .
It is the most important matter , because most of us is not able to buy highly educational books .
Besides issues that have been already mentioned there is also undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library , it would be more representative .
Given the rationality of the above arguments , we , pupils , expect a positive consideration to our request .
Our live has changed a lot from the last century due to the technological improvements and society changes .
But how will change the people 's life in 50 years ? .
This is a difficult question to be answered too quickly because we have to take into account that we have not enough knowledge at all to do it .
First of all , as we said before the people 's lives have changed due two important elements which are the technological improvements and society changes .
The first one it is very obvious because every day the researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new invents and improve the old ones .
For example , one of the most important devices that has taken an important role in our lives is the mobile phone which has changed extremely fast over the last ten years .
Another example is the cars which are taking the same way as well as the mobile phone has done .
The second one is very important too because society has changed a lot as well as the people 's mind .
For instance , one hundred years ago was impossible to see a woman working and carrying on economically the whole family alone or studying a degree in the university , things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society .
In addition , there are other conditions and facts that has helped to change the people 's lives such as political decisions , global wars and global economical problems , etc .
To sum up , there are many issues that affects people 's lives and we do not know how it would change in the future , but we are sure that in 50 years from now it would be an important change as well as it happened these last 50 years ago .
I am writing to You in connection with Your request for information on an interesting building or place to visit in Katowice .
At first I would like to tell you that Katowice is a wonderful city , full of great places to see .
The most interesting is the art gallery Oko Miasta , which is located in the city centrr .
It is a very distinctive place because of its magnitude , its outsite look and its atmosphere .
What 's more , in the middle of the biulding there is a small library where people used to buy the newest books and papers .
Furthermore , in the biulding of the art gallery there is a club Oko .
Not only it is the popular place among young Polish citizens , but also it is very extraodrinary : people can walk the red carpet and drink the most famous drinks .
In my opinion art gallery Oko Miasta would be the best place You can visit with your group .
I recommended it because it is the best place for young people .
Grass hockey is a popular sport practiced among people of all ages and it 's more played in countries like Britain , Argentina or German rather than Spain or Italy .
This sport consist of beating the rival by scoring as many goals as possible .
In order to score you should push a small white plastic ball inside the goal using a stick .
In my opinion grass hockey is the best sport you can play as it requieres you to be really focused on to hit the ball correctly .
Besides , when you practise it you must move all your body , because you have to run and guide the ball through the field .
So now , if you 're thinking hockey is for you I recommend you to buy a pair or good grass boots .
And do n't worry if you are not able with sports that involve using a tool you can always be the goal keeper in your team .
It was the usual Friday afternoon .
" Okay , I think it 's time I go in " .
My sister should definitely close her windows , I am going out of this house , I should leave this cat here and let it ruin her things " .
Firstly , Disney is not a common destination like beaches or mountains , it is a place that requireds a different means of transport since it is in a long distance .
The vacatios starts when the plane takes off and nerves and happiness blend creating an experience you will never forget .
When the plane arrives at the airport of Miami you can appreciate the beautiful viwe that thid place offers .
Secondly , The entrance of Disney is incredible and colorful , it also has the main characters in it .
Disney has such a lot of amusement parks whose makes this place fantastic .
Each of one has a different topic and amazing coasters perfect to adolecents .
Although this place offers a very good service to eat , you can bring your own food .
To conclude , Disney has so many facilities that it is impossible to get bord , you can relax in your hotel and have an unforgettable moment in the roller coasters
I think that public traffic will be more used in the future .
We have to therefore choose the other alternatives .
For the sake of that the public transport will be improved , instead of being replaced by cars .
This technology will be improved furthermore in the future .
For the above reasons I suspect that the share of public transport do n't decrease rather increase in the future .
The share of cars could remain because of the electric cars .
But the form of using cars could change .
For example car sharing could increase in the city .
I 'm not addicted to films what so ever , but I prefer to watch the ones that are said to be good and stand out from the others .
Besides that , if I had to choose a type of film I would say , the comedian and the action ones are the most appealing to me if they have a real dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one .
Recently I saw some pretty good films called " The Wolf of Wall Street " and " Capitan Philips " , films that caught my attention since the first minute .
Honestly , they lasted for 3 hours but the most impressive of all this is that they were able to create a single world between me and the screen for all that time .
They really caught my attention , they had all the characteristics that I consider the basic ones in a film , not couting with the astonishing actors that made an impressive performance .
All I expect in a film is the way they establish connections between the actors and the audience , in a way that allows them to play with the characters like if they were puppets and to create a coherent and attractive film .
I am writing this letter regarding the announcement in the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I understand that you required for peoples have good English , energetic , cheerful and hardworking , who that are able to look after children among 8 and 12 , help organise sports and evening activities as work in the kitchen .
I have previous experience working with " ADRENALINE SUMMER CAMPS " coaching children how to play football for a football championship within the summer camps also organized other activities such climbing , running , competitions , expedition and other movement .
Moreover , help in the kitchen to prepare fresh food for children .
During the time I spent coaching , organizing and helping in the kitchen , I learn that the most important thing is to keep a positive attitude and always motivate them in every step of the way .
In this way , the kids are always up for the challenge and do not give up upon their first obstacle .
Y truly enjoy working with children to help them learn and improve their already acquired skills , especially in sports .
Hence the reason I am very interested in this opportunity to coach sports to children during this summer .
I look forward to hearing from you soon
Because of him I am what I am .
I think everybody knows the importance of having a person , who is always there .
He is a soilder in the military in thun , where he works as a teacher .
In future he wants to get a general .
We have met us years ago , when we were babies because our mothers were and are good friends .
As you can think he is a very straight person , who knows what he wants .
But he also can be harmfully and sensible .
For me , a good person to speak about everything especially about my problems .
Although we have many different views of the life we understand each other and are best friends .
Many people around the world follow passionately international sports events .
That could be a great way to stop international tensions , although crisis and wars still exist .
The most important events takes place in some different country every four years .
Of course during these events all the world watch it .
Usually I do n't watch sports match , I used to do that sometimes , but nowadays I 've been thinking that it 's just a waste of money and time .
Probably because I do n't like team sports .
I 'm keen on individual discipline .
I do n't want to appear too rigid but I 've seen too many times people forgot the real problem and think only to this thing .
People seems to be distract from their real life .
The point is that we have to make the world better not just sometimes , but forever .
During these events people seem to fall into a peaceful dream where all the country love each other without show racist feeling .
Whereas often we see bad behavior .
I 'm happy about that , but I still thinking that it 's not the truth .
Probably us , as human race necessitate of this kind of things .
I 'd prefer that people express their good behavior independently of international sports events .
On the other hand , sometimes I 'm feeling happy during this event because people seems to be so excited .
In my opinion we have to deal with a lot of other important point related to our culture .
I 've been interested in play an instrument since I was a child .
When I was young we used to have a piano in our dining room because my mother used to play that .
Latent fingermarks are commonly found at the scene of crime .
They are key corner in forensic investigation .
Latent form of fingermark is invisible to human eye , hence need some methods for visualization and development of latent fingermarks .
Divergent approaches are used on routine basis for development of latent fingermarks .
Powders by adhering physically to the fingermark residue developed the latent , chemical reagents undergo reactions with the organic and inorganic parts of the fingermarks developing the latent , small particle reagent developed latent fingermarks by adhesion to sebaceous content of the fingermarks , ninhydrin reacting to amino acid of the fingermark and developed the latent marks , single and multi - metal deposition methods works on the principle of deposition and resulting in the negative development of latent marks .
so starting from powders to chemicals , all are in public eye .
New methods are continually added in the literature and shows the importance of fingerprints in criminal investigation system .
one can easily deduce information of culprits with partial form of latent fingermark .
Have you ever thought why we need sports ?
As we all know it is an essential part of our life .
I believe that nobody can do without it .
For example , playing sport at least two times a week prevents diseases and obesity .
What is more , if you want to get rid of depression or stress - go to the gym .
According to the scientific research mental health is closely connected to the physical one .
I am into it because it is quite catchy and spectaculous .
To sum up , I believe that if you want to be mentally and physically fit - try to do some sport and exercise . Also do not worry if you are not so good at it , just keep doing it and enjoy yourself .
Plants have been widely used by almost all cultures in past centuries for medical purposes that are commonly known as herbal medicines ( Izzo and Ernst , 2009 ) .
These are defined as plant - derived substances and occur naturally with no or minimal manufacturing processes that manage and remedy various health conditions effectively ( Bent , 2008 ; Tachjian ; Maria and Jahangir , 2010 ) .
Although , herbal medicines have significantly performed well in the treatment and management of illness , people have increasingly consumed these products via self - directed therapy .
This essay will discuss that there is considerable evidence for the possible detrimental influence on public health due to the increasing use of self - prescribed herbal medicines and that a health crisis is likely if no action is taken by health organisations .
However , I 'm not referring to the musical nor the intermediate version ; the oldest version is the referenced one .
It is a movie that has presents a lot of richness in characters and historical facts .
You are able to analyse human emotions and rationalise moral situations , so it is a movie that provides a lot of factors .
It is very profound too , because it shows you problems that could happen but in a minor scale .
I think people who read the book ( written by Victor Hugo ) , who are interested in this historical incident , or who merely want to analyse human relationships must see the movie .
This is due to the fact that it will teach a lot about the French daily life and about what inspires people to improve and cause good .
Suddenly , the man went back and looked at her .
In fact he wore a black suit and a lovely linen tie .
Maria could n't hardly say anything , she was shocked by Robert .
Then Robert smailed and giving his hand towards hers said : ' I have missed you a lot ' .
In purpose of building more necessary networks of housing and transport , areas of farmland , forest and wetland have to be destroyed by many countries today .
Such large - scale building projects has created a large amounts of problems for both human beings and animals .
As to people who make their livings by selling the products they obtained from farmlands , forests and wetlands , they will lose their sources of incomes .
In addtion , farmers , huntsmen , fishermen and any other people that are used to living by such areas have to move to cities and try to find new jobs .
As a result , they will not make enough money to afford their livings in urban areas and even face problems of poverty .
Meanwhile , wild animals which take forests and wetlands as their habitas will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to be found after the destruction of their homelands .
Also , there will be no fresh grass and grains for domestic animals , such as cows , lamps , chichen to be fed .
To reduce above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before construction of builings and transport and try their best to decrese the side effects .
They should provide economic support to those who once lived in such destroyed lands and help them improve professional skills to look for good jobs .
Meanwhile , they need to build natural reserves for wild animals which can not easily find another habitats to live .
Although there will be many bad influences of large - scale building on people and animals , the countries would develop better if governments could take efforts to solve above problems .
Personally for me shopping is very pleasant , but sometimes it can be a little tiring .
In my opinion is a few advantage of shopiing .
Another good point of shopiing is fact , that it could be relaxing for some people .
It give me some pleasure and fun .
Anyway , it 's also some disadvantages of shopping .
Michael was a 23 years old boy , who wanted to be famous artist .
He had very good talent but no one understood his creative mind .
Everyone considered him as a crazy and boring guy obsessioned by his passion ; except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to let his dream down .
At that time Kate was working in an international advertising office .
It was a really busy and hard period for her because her costumers of every part of the Earth wanted something new in the subject of art .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutional at the same time , something that could give a new vision of the reality and Kate started to bring some information about many artist .
One night she was working at her home ; she was in difficulty because no one satisfy her clients .
She started to be a little bit nervous , she was n't able to find any solution when , suddeny , she remembered that Michael 's art had the features requested by her clients .
She immediately took the phone and called Michael and she started to explain her project .
Michael was very excited because he finally had the possibility to introduce his view of art throut his pictures .
After lots of meeting and conferences with the representation of China , Japan , Usa and Oceany Michael began to be the man who he dreamed since he was a child .
Now he was famous and everyone respects him .
Everything was going good except his behaviour with his friend Kate .
On day the two guys had a terrible discussion .
Kate accused Michael that the celebrity made him blind and Michael did n't want to listen to her .
Kate was really angry and she oredered to him to leave her room immediately .
Kate was crying a lot but Michael run away .
Enjoying outdoors in my area
What Places you can visit
There are many parks and green areas close to this city where young people could spend their time outdoors and having fun during all day before going out , such a park called : San francisco , which has a big lake and local young people are used to having barbecues there , after they had done any water sport or rented a boat .
In addition there are many public transport which could drop you off in front of the park .
where you can have an amazing night
We have an active Nightlife in this city , live gigs are performed from Wednesday to Sunday in several pubs with free access and our cinemas have always had a good movie listing
Whenever I hear about famous actor or singer complaining on photographers following them , I ca n't get a smile off my face .
What 's a description of a famous person ?
Most of the people know a lot about him .
So do n't tell me that famous people do n't enjoy being on the first page of the newspaper or any other magazine .
In my opinion the fame is a need for actors and musicians of the popular culture .
Despite the fact I said that famous people need to be well known , I think that ca n't be applied on politicians .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie stars , but they should make their descisions transparent for most of the population tho .
It is their work to make descisions that ensure the benefit of the people in their country , but we do n't need to know nothing else about them , after they come home to spend some time with their families .
It is my pleasure to write a recommendation letter for mr .
I have known Kadeer since 2012 , when he joined the faculty of Computers and Information , Fayoum University as an undergraduate student .
He attended my labs on " structured programming " course during the first year .
While attending my labs , he showed himself as an active and hard - working student .
We frequently discussed various hard problems in the scope of the course , and I was impressed by his analytical abilities .
He also attended my lectures and labs in " Java SE " summer training course .
He showed up a distinct and intellectual level among other students .
He contributed excellent and innovative ideas during this project and he showed himself that he is an excellent team player .
Indeed I consider mr .
I believe that Mr. Kadeer will perform very well and I strongly recommend him for " Google Student Ambassador MENA Program " .
He was very naughty and was not much interested in his studies .
He was a very big menace and the villagers hated him because of his mischievious behavior .
One day while he was all alone at home , he thought of calling the fire force and lied and pretended as if his house was on fire .
People gathered around his house hearing him screaming out loud and within no time the fire force also arrived at the destination .
At the same time , his parents reached the place and seeing the big crowd and the fire force they got horrified .
They ran towards their house , worried for their child .
Every one was shocked and no one knew what was happening .
Later his parents became very angry and even got him beaten up for his mischief .
His parents scolded him and made him make a promise to them that he wo n't lie ever in his life again .
He was even made to apologize to all his neighboring villagers .
last month i watched the Fast and Furious 7 , a film stared by Vin diesel and my favorite actor , Dwayne ' The Rock ' Johnson .
this film was about the previous roberry which had been accomplished by Vin 's gangs leads to the hatred of a criminal stared by Jason Statham .
Jason statham was so strong and made all the gang feel terrible fear since dwayne Johnson was inroaded and heavily wounded .
the chasing of Jason Vs Vin was so exciting furthermore the walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jason interrupted by another party .
The end of the story when Diesel get cornered by Jason , spontaneously Dwayne came and fired jason with a machine gun .
The next scene was demolishing of the whole building as well as exploding of jason 's copter .
Finally , Diesel was found alive and get evacuated to the medical center , where Jason was broughted to the jail .
Vin 's family lived happily ever after because the enemy was eradicated and the rest were got jailed .
The film was the last movie stared by Paul Walker as in the film production process he passed away due to car accident .
This film will catch everyone 's attention because the scenarios , the action scenes , and drama beyond paul 's death are harmonized rigorously .
Moreover , the special effect which is displayed are so immense and lead us to feel the emotions of the actors .
I know how much you like both activities so just I suppose you are having a hard time .
Soccer has always been part of your life and memories of you kid kicking a ball bigger than you are still vivid in my mind .
I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson you promised me you never give up!. You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you reached it .
You 've kept working on it for almost your entire life now and although you have not become a professional one you have never given up .
When I first introduced you to it you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements .
But again you never gave up and now you playing in the 3rd Orchestra in Town shows how big you are .
Proof that not only you are very determined but that piano was meant to be .
As you asked my take what I tried to do was nothing but thinking of you as if you were my son .
First off , I would take him to a long journey by car .
Then once we get on the car I 'd let the music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words .
Only after driving for a while I would ask him to tell me what he 's been up to lately and if there 's anything he hasn't told me about but keen to mention now .
At that point I would let his talking go without stopping him from interruption .
I 'm convinced he 'll speak his thought at once without beating around the bush and all his fear and doubt will slip out .
By now he will be able to answer himself many questions he 's been troubling with .
All I 'll have to do is just point out what the main points are that he is too dull to see .
Because that 's what an outside criterion is needed for .
Then he 'll be lost for words as much as he spoke and he will be willing to put the whole thing aside and just lose himself in some drinks , although he hasn't come to age yet for that .
Perhaps the next day he wo n't even be able to recall what the speaking was about but I 'm pretty sure that after all deep down himself he will know what best move on is to make ! !
I really enjoy volleyball and horse riding , although my favourite is swimming .
It is a hard sport , but when you are it , you forget all your problems .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , especially in the Summer because in the water you can get fresh .
You just need practise .
Everyone should have a sport , when you are doing it , you do n't think about anything more .
Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling , but public transportation is the most effective way to bring people from a place to another .
Try to imagine that , if everyone in the city has his or her own vehicle , we would be always late due to the terrible traffic jam .
The reason is that we have to wake up in the very early morning for avoiding the traffic jam to attending school , working , etc .
For example , a bus can take more than 40 passengers one time at a low cost .
For another , the subway is able to transport a number of people around the city .
The second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution for a city .
Too many vehicles in a crowned city would increase the carbon emissions .
In conclusion , public transportation would still pay an important role of transportation in a city unless the environmental vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well for accommodating a huge number of cars .
So , we can obtain certain benefits and more doors that can be opened easily .
There are some people that spend too much of their time doing nothing useful although others may say that it helps to be more relaxed in their lives .
Personally , people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons .
For example , when I was 17 , I was about starting my first day of class in the university .
I started to feel bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that did n't have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Laws , and so on .
But later when I graduated , I realized how important were those subjects .
I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation .
That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in the life .
Second , if you avoid doing things only because those do n't like you , you 'll miss opportunities .
You 'll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it really will hurt you .
For instance , a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city , he was requested to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes .
He refused to do this .
After all , one guy decided to do the venture .
Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner , and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort .
As you can see , my friend lost the opportunity because he did n't like what he was requested to do .
To sum up , it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment though you do n't like it .
If you do essential things you gain time in your life at the same time .
If you would rather avoid essential or required things you 'll lose many chances to succeed .
So , we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention over the last century , while others think that are a lot of inventions over the history that are more important than the computer .
Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and is for that I think it is the most important invention .
Some people say that the computer change the way people see the world , and this change the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .
For example , how one person can be informed what happens to the other side of the world with only a click .
For other part , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with your friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that exist inventions more important than the computer that nowadays we still use .
For example the paper or the wheel .
Overall , people are divided in what they think about the most important invention in the world and what changes these objects make to the world and humanity , I still think that the computer is the most important invention because it not only changes one part of the history like the parper or the wheel , it changes every aspect of the human 's life .
Personally I prefer different movies .
Most of the time I like to watch comedies , love stories and adventure movies because these types of films can help me relax after a hard working day .
Therefore I feel more peaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and undemanding .
In my opinion , people watch movies because they want to spend their leisure time .
Movie companies offer all kinds of movies so everybody can choose something that he likes .
Thank you for your reply , it was so useful , but I still have some doubts and I will be really glad if you could give me this necessary information .
First of all , I want to know what water sports do you offer , because our group of students would be probably interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surf , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would also like to ask you about the type of equipment you can lend to do this kind of activities and sports I have just mentioned .
For example , for doing diving , are you provided of all the diving gear ( oxygen bottles , wetsuits , security elements , etc . ) ?
As you said , the safety of the students is our maximum concern , we must be completely sure that you will take care of them , chiefly because most of the students are still young and we have a strong commitment to their parents .
In my opinion , this statement could be said for a person who lives in a city with little traffic or a person who prefers travel in a freedom way instead of being concerned about public transport schedules .
However , I do n't think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city , what is more if you take in a count the economic aspects .
Since my view , to use the public transport in this case have two important advantages : the first one you do n't have to care about parking ; the second one you can move in a relaxed way reading a book , listening to music or talking with other passengers .
Nevertheless , having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not only because the petrol price is continuously raising but also you have to pay high taxes for the car .
In short , although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than do it by public transport , it is not probably than in the near future they disappear .
Is it true that there is no future for public transport .
As i recognized there are severeal way to improve because we are trying invent a lot of thing every day .
You would not think but when you are just thinking you may have the chance to invet something new and useful for humanity .
Inventors work years to reach their goals they are working with their project like you every day .
Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life .I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioner or anything which can make travling enjoyable .
Most of the people are frustrated or nervous because they have to use public transport .
If the bus drivers can follow their time table there wo n't be any argument .
Artifitual Intelligent is one of the best way , we can switch drivers to these vehicles .
They will only follow the orders and wo n't be out of time and there would not be any arguments .
In conclusion we have a lot of things how o improve .
We can also help by paying our tickets , yes this is simple but these companies need money to improve their businness .
Help theme and enjoy your travelling .
It was raining cats and dogs when she realized that he had lost one of the most important things in her life .
In fact , probably it was n't a significant thing for most people but it was it for her .
It was a ring which was given away by her mother .
Probably that day was the worst day in her life , besides she hasn't got married , her sister had died in a car accident , It had been a terrified accident , her sister was driving from Ciudadela and she crushed into a tree .
She was outside the church when a friend of her called to tell the new about the accident .
If I had known that there were full of problems I 'd have gone on travel instead to get married .
Hello I 'm Mathieu Sanabria and I 'm here to deny and explain everything about the case of my sextape , I went to a party with my football team - mates and we were having a whale of time then some girls arrived and I started to talk with one of them , I like her and she likes me so we went to my room to have privacy and I do n't know how but some guys get into my room and started to record my with the girl and I did n't noted then many days after I received a call from a guy that tell me that he have a very explicit video of me doing things with a girl and that if I do n't give him some money he will put that video on the Internet .
I think that he makes a wild goose chase he just bitten off more than he can chew because he does n't know me and I 'm going to make him pay for what he had done .
In other ways I 'll talk about Benzema , he is my friend for many years ago but I 'm not sure if he is with me or with the others guys so I want to listen to their version of the story so he is here to talk about that .
I 'm gutted because he is my childhood friend .
He talked about a plan about Sanabria .
He set up plan and he made true .
He made a video his friend and Mathieu .
He asked to me how much money should I wanted from Mathieu?Then I asked him how much do you need?He said about one hundred thousand euros and after that I said " you can get it".With hindsight , I was wrong because it was illegal .
The Number of the Beast was the third album Iron Maiden relesead .
The British band announced that the album was coming with news , a new singer , Bruce Dickison , joined the group and made the fans completely astonished by his nice - sounding voice .
Most of the songs show demoniac features causing serious concerns on the media .
In this album the drummer was really great and fantastic eletric guitar solos were showed too .
This oddly - named album became the most well - known on the history of the band .
I 'd say that was their best album and obviously they rock
I am living in Chennai one of the populated city in India perhaps one of the most polluted city in India too .
The city is dwell with people , cars , bikes and factories , which turned out to be one of the polluted city in India .
The infrastructure build for controlling and maintaining the environment ecosystem friendly is worst in other words government and people do not care about the environment rather they spoiling the environment drastically .
The government always says the statement they are doing their best to improve environment but nothing as done perhaps they corrupting people money in terms of various projects that controls the pollution of the city .
The government is not only one to blamed but also people who leaving here , who never cares of their environment .
They polluting more than factory does , by using plastic material , disposing wastes in public places and even some people tend to split and use public places as their toilet .
Although many factories and people is polluting the environment drastically but some people and organization is protecting the environment but most often these people are discriminated from society .
But they do n't care about this and continue with there work , often these people tend to demonstrate the effect of the pollution on people and future generation and made some people to change the way look the city but often some most people do n't care about what they trying to say and sometimes these people are scold .
So far people do n't understand the consequence of the pollution but with in decade they will then the suffer and understand the consequence of pollution in their life for sure .
Dear Joe
I have seen your advertisement and I am more than delighted to take part in a summer camp as an assistant .
In addition to this I go to the gym three times a fortnight and I took swimming lessons for 3 years .
Also I had also taken some self - defense lessons and a climbing course over the Alps .
I think that I deserve to have a job here because with my swimming and climbing knowledge I can entertain the children .
And in order to help them defend themselves I can also teach them some techniques about self - defense .
Anyway I hope I will get the job and I am able to attend an interview at half past nine on Saturday .
Yours sincerely
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Lula , is a myth .
As the only Brazilian president from unprivileged background , Lula has made history after running for four times for President .
Since he took up the office in 2002 Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking out more than fourty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
During Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom as never before and became a world 's economic power .
Democracy also had fundamental changes on that period .
To curb corruption new laws were created , instituions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .
Minority groups received more attention to protect their rights and investments in education , health and well being increased .
For the poorest Brazilians Lula and his history is to be proud of .
For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor migrant from northern Brazil , overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own , priviliged , university educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems .
I am writing to apply for a job in the USA I saw recently in your advertisement in a local newspaper from my city .
Furthermore , I have worked in some important companies when I finished my degree in Journalism five years ago .
By the way , I had experience in the organization of sport and evening activities because at the university I did a course of Public Relations .
If you want to see my reports I can send you whenever you want or if you prefer to ask my teachers about me I can send you their phone numbers in case you want references from my job .
My teachers have said to me that if you want can write a letter about my experience .
In my country people go to work by own cars .
Students go to school or university by cars as well .
As a result of horrible traffic jams took place .
The government had to start a major public transportation projects in order to solve the problem .
Underground metro in Riyadh is one of those projects .
Long distance between cities makes it difficult to use cars .
Airplanes are the best way to travel through long distances .
It 's fast , easy , comfortable and safe way .
transport workers by public transportation or by buses is more convenient for big companies .
I think travelling by car is a very comfortable way .
Yout do n't have to think about Bus timetables and gates .
You only can go to your car , sit in and drive away .
All what you need is a driving licence , a car and a little bit luck that there is no traffic .
If you go with a train , you need a ticket , that 's not very cheap !
You must know the timetables and at which gate the train will leave .
You have to be fast , if you want a seat to sit , sometimes the trains are full of people and you have to stand the whole way !
I think it 's right , that travelling by car will be more popular .
You drive the way you want .
You can stop wherever you want and there are a lot of other points to travell with the car .
I 've just finished reading 50 shades off Grey ....
It is really good , it is better than the previous novel FSOGrey , i really mean it , It is not porn , BE GROWN UP PLEASE , when you do nt want to read the " sex parts " just turn over the next every single page till it ends , that s all , i hve done like that to finish that novel , This novel is just to tell us the passionate love story between a sucessful business man , chairmen man with stricly unhappy childhood , and only refers to his birth mother as " the crack whore " which related to the his recently behaviour - BDSM and the girl was seemed very bored of rountine life , innocent , did nt know anything about life , Apparently , THEY were so diffirent from each other but somehow , some magic connecting them to be a very lovely couple .
It would bug me if s1 did nt read it to say that is a porn novel
The two maps depict the main changes which take place in Shipsmouth between the year 1995 and 2010 .
In 1995 , there were green areas , however they were cut down and an airport and an apartment block were built in those areas .
Another interesting redevelopment is that factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre , and in the same way was for Church which was pulled down to take place for a pub .
A final notable change is that football stadium was erected in the south of the city in 2010 .
Player is required to run all over the field to chase the ball and to return it to the opponent .
To win the game , a good strategy should be also applied .
One must recognize the field and the strengths , as well as the weaknesses , of his opponent to make a point .
Thus it is a game with a combination of brain and physical skills .
A wall in a tennis field can be a good start to learn how to hit a ball .
It will be better of course to join a club or to get a trainer to guide .
Information about the basic theory and technique on tennis can be gathered in internet / books .
One should make the effort to practise regularly to make sure a continual progress .
Learning to do juggling will also be beneficial .
Many coaches advise their pupils to practise it for a better coordination of hand and eye .
But most importanly , one should enjoy all of this with fun .
I exactly do n't understand why people want to learn about private life of politicians and film stars .
I have to say that everybody has the right to have a private life although they are famous .
It means nobody should interfere with famous people 's lives .
Famous people also have got needs .
Megastars can run into bushy problems .
Because all the people have got predicaments .
But public wants to see famous politicians and stars in every situation .
For example they want to see well - known people with her boyfriend / his girlfriend or want to see them in causal attire or want to see famous women without make - up .
On the other hand , should be considered this opinion : Some of big names are important for someone who has them like an ideal .
And media appear on the scene .
Media make use of this interest and thanks to this coin much money .
On the scene of TV , media closes their defects or removes .
And all the time follow famous people and their families .
Privacy invasion seems to be an absolute right of media .
However , being able to protect against an invasion of privacy is a fundamental human right of stars .
The government should give to superstars the right to protection of personal relationships and activities .
Ultimately , crowd - pleasing people also have got any civic rights just like everyone else .
Nowadays , many people prefer owing a car more than using public transport .
It is more convenient as you can travel straightly to the place you want to go .
Some may say that we do not need public transport anymore in the future .
However , I think public transport should be kept as it still have their values .
First of all , public transport provide the experience of the journey .
Public transport is not only bus , but also plane and ferry .
That is the experience can not given by car .
So I think Public transport should remain .
Last but not least , public transport can share the cost of traveling .
The pollution of many car is so much .
The air pollution make the climate change .
To sum up , public transport still have their own values .
The President of the United States of America Mackinley says that , regarding Cuba , he will not meddle until December .
The newspaper " Times " publishes an intercepted letter written by the Spanish Ambassador Dupuy de Lowe that will make him resign due to what he wrote about the USA .
Next to the blow - up of the North American steamer Maine , the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures that it could n't be done from the outside , but from the inside .
On the other hand , the USA commission brings their results to the Parliament without previously notify their results to Spain and with the opposite conclusion of the Spanish commission .
However , the Spanish government does not agree with the USA 's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with an international arbitrage .
Mackinley ask for the arbitration of the Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain reclaims North Americans to get out of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict .
Later , the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to military intervene in Cuba if necessary .
The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date .
In this Memorandum , the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of the president Mackinley .
Also , this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict , which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blow - up of the steamer Maine , the latter being remarked concerning the USA rejected the Spanish proposition to carry out the arbitrage together .
The 21st of April EEUU denies the Spanish sovereignty over Cuba , the 23rd of April Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and the 25th USA declares the war to Spain .
Since that day , the diplomatic relations between both nations will be suspended .
Being able to keep a promise is a very important quality of a person .
So it is not just a fundamental element of being a good person but also effects on your society .
If you can keep promises to your friends , that mean how much you really care about them .
I know how important of keeping promises . I always try to keep them .
But the problem is I do really care about my friends , so I always say " Yes " to my friends , because I do n't want to disappoint them .
So keeping a promise is good , but the thing is : Do n't keep too many promises at the same time ! You should consider if you really can complete it or not .
I 'm glad you have graduated the school and that you have plans to go to the university .
It 's good for you to take a year brake before continuing with your studies .
This way you have the chance to relax and to think what is best for you in the future .
Before I continue , please remember to write back with an exact date of your arrival so I can arrange some things with your trips .
I 'm going to make you a very nice ittinerary and hopefully we 'll also find something for you to work .
First I advise you to come and visit my hometown , because it is a nice one .
We 'll visit the Hall City Tower , the zoo , the citadelle and we also have some beautiful parks with a lot of green grass and old trees .
Then we can go visit the Fortress in Sighisoara which is the only fortress in Europe to be actually inhabited .
The next days we can go and visit a salt mine at Praid and The Bear Lake , which is a salt lake in Sovata .
I also recommend you to visit Brasov and The Black Church , The Peles Castle and why not The Black Sea .
I think you know that I have a friend which is a teacher .
He can come with us in our trip .
Concernig your working plans , I have an uncle who owns a farm , so I think we can arrange for you to work there .
I assure you 'll have a good time in my country .
I am going to wait for you at the train station .
My husband is so annoying , sometimes he keep talking and talking without any goal , he drops his dirty socks and clothes all over the house and always shouting for lunch , he sleeps in the middle of good movies and important subjects and snores while sleeping .. all he wants to do is too eat and sleep
he says I shop too much but the fact is he does n't want to spend money , he stopped buying me flowers and chocolates and he stopped being romantic
after all of that he keep asking why I have changed with him !
The fact is he is not the same man I have married and that issue upsets me so much .
he keep saying I love you but I do n't feel it any more , I sacrifice my life in my lovely country for him and left my family to be with him but seems like it was one huge mistake as I feel like I am living with a stranger and he is nothing like the man he promised me to be .
anyway I still love him and still have the hope that this is just a temporary period in our life and he will be back to the man I loved once especially that we have the most amazing reason to live for its our beautiful son our angel and amazing love of our life .
There are widely different views on the public transport future .
Despite some people would suggest that such service has no future because people are more rely on car as it is convenient , it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has its future .
Two of the principle reasons for this are as follows .
Firstly , the society today are more concerned about environmentally friendly .
This is a worth seeing be concerned because air pollution has negative impact on our health and the ecosystems .
The more cars on the road , the more green house gases produced .
Therefore , public transport play an important role to mitigate global warming .
For example , if a bus can carry 100 passengers , at least 25 cars can be reduced on road , solved the problem of traffic jam .
There are thousands of students travel with public transport to school everyday because they can not drive and their parents do not have time to drive them .
Moreover , insurance , petrol , repair fees are very expensive .
On the other hand , public transport is good value of money .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should have future .
Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco - friendly , and there are still many people rely on public transport .
Everyone deserves to have a private life , even celebrities and stars , who is a life and soul of the party during their working hours .
We all need a shelter , where we can hide from daily difficulties .
This is the only way to maintain mental health and not to fall into depression .
It means that in everyday life they are faced with the same problems as we do .
What is more , celebrities as ordinary people need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationship with others .
As ordinary people they need someone to take care of them , someone to share their feelings with .
They can gain fame and admiration thanks to their skills but their stage personality is more like a powerful creation .
Sometimes in everyday life they are not even interesting in terms of character and appearance .
That is why a private life is so important , especially for stars assessed all the time by society .
I 'd like to tell you about the concert I was .
I 've met few nice people and we had a great time with them .
They showed me everything I should do .
I had to carry some musical instruments and install a software .
I love to help people and the best was I meet members of band and have the autographs !
Learning new languages is becoming a priority for young people because most of them go to study abroad and work with foreign countries .
I believe that knowing more languages is always better . that way people have a lot more culture and are more knowledgeable .
It takes a lot of time to know any language fluently and it waists time .
Even if you learn a certain language and you do n't use it manually , you will simply forget it .
In conclusion learning languages may be very handy but can also be a killing time activity .
I saw your advertisement looking for a kids monitor , and I think I could be the best person to fill that position .
I have a degree in English and I would like to learn how the Americans speak it in real live .
For that reason , it would be a wonderful chance to learn amongst kids and adults in the USA Summer Camps .
I have worked at schools in Spain and I have first hand knowledge about organising sports and activities .
Although I have no title , I love cooking .
I would love to answer any question you could ask through this email , qq@gmail.com , and this mobile phone number , 666666666 . I would be delighted to attend an interview whenever you see fit .
I look forward to hearing from you in the nearing future .
Michael went to a trip to Poland by himself .
At his 5th day of his trip , he hiked a very high mountain , but weirdly he never seen any people .
About 1 hour after he started to hike , he saw a big cave and there was a cozy - yellow glow inside the cave .
Next to him were few dozens of doors and there were letters written on it .
He led me to a room which said ' Happy ' at the door .
When Michael stepped into the room , I felt something very fresh inside me .
I felt happy .
The old man said , " You feel happy , Do n't you ? " Michael nodded .
He went on , " Every room have a feeling written on it .
That feeling tells you what you will feel inside the room . " .
Michael went into couple of rooms until I spotted a room written ' Anger ' .
He was curios about how he will feel when he goes into the room .
I think , that everybody deserve privacy , including famous people .
They can barelly breathing with all those photographers around them .
I do n't know why people love spying famous people .
Another useless thing are gossip .
Why are they even exist ?
Thay can really damage the reputation of someone .
I also think that the following famous people sometimes could be dangerous .
For example , when fan follow the cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredicable or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
My opinion is , that the famous people deserve a quiet time , when they are with their partners or with family , but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym .
Yesterday I saw in the magazine photo of Sarah Jessica Parker on which she was walking with her dog .
The headline was : LOOK AT THE SARAH WITHOUT MAKE - UP , SHE LOOKS LIKE A HORSE !
My first though was : " God , let her live her life !
Why when men stalk a women they forbid him to come closer to her , but when a papparazi hide in car of celebrity , he will get a huge pack of bucks for the photos ?
Years ago , we used to get through with other people ringing up or texting messages by our mobile phone and as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate by social networks such as twitter , facebook , whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news , social issues by twitter instead of newspapers , for instance , it 's usually to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings news by his smartphone , an image so far from years back .
We also can have more knowledge about current issues by Facebook pages which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes such as political discussions , strikes , economy ... As far I concerned , nowadays population know more about what 's going on in the world than in previous years .
One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countries where their Government ban to have access Internet to citizens , in other words , they want to mislead about reality avoiding population could claim bu this nets or up in arms against their system .
On the other hand , we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends by facebook , uploading photos at any time , taking a coffee , watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere .
So , this means we are getting less intimity and becoming more gossiping at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow to your favourite celebrities and have a direct interaction but this also has negative consequences such as some followers critise to them
Michael Xander is the famous team captain of Onix University , one of the most prestigious school in the Philippines .
He was born with a spoon on his mouth .
He has everything : the looks , the brains and the charm but he has never felt contented .
He has never been serious on the entire 17 years of his life .
Everything has been easy for him , he used to get what he wanted .
He thinks that life 's a game and he should surely win whatever it takes .
One of his favourite game is to conquer every girl he liked and break their heart .
She was describe as plain Jane of the campus .
The never been noticed girl , Celine .
One day , in the silence of nowhere while Celine was reading a book she felt someone beside her .
It was a new thing for her knowing that someone had the guts to sit next to her because almost all the people on that school define her as a weirdoe .
She looked up and she was surprised seeing the stranger beside her is the famous Michael .
She was starstrucked .
Everyone in that school knows him and how flirt he is . '
Seeing her that close makes him realised that she 's not ugly .
She 's gorgeous , if she would only take off her glasses maybe other people will notice it too . '
Nice then , do you mind going out with me on a date ? '
he blurted . '
This guy actually ask her out and she 's not that stupid not to know his intentions .
He had never expected that he would receive a no from this kind of girl that is even far from his type .
She just challenged him .
The past two weeks of Celine 's life changed in just a blink of eye .
She knew herself that Michael is just playing with her and she said to herself that she will never fall into his trap .
She 's going out with him .
Since then , everything went so perfect between the two of them .
Celine realised that Michael is not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael 's reputation .
One of the things she knew about him is that Michael loves to surprise , that 's why she wants to surprised him too .
She 's on her way to the court where Michael was practing when she heard guys talking .
' Do you still plan on finishing our bet or the rumor is true Michael ? You have fallen to Miss Jane ? ' it was Nicolaih Heindric voice . '
I ca n't wait to have that car of yours ' Michael said .
Celine knew at that moment that her world had fallen down .
Tears automatically falls down her face .
Everything Michael did for her was just for a bet .
The next day while Michael is on his pad watching tv , he heard his door bell rang , he was surprised to receive someone now .
The last time he remember he never invited anyone .
He would like to invite Celine but he knew she would decline to him again and he 's not ready to be alone with her .
Maybe he 's too coward to admit it but yes , he 's inlove with Celine .
He knew how Celine loves having her privacy , he knew the moment he admit to everyone that he loves her , she would never have her normal life anymore .
He just loves that girl that he would protect her from everything .
Even if it cost him hiding how much he loves her .
When he open the door he was more surprised to see who 's on the door .
His eyes looked automatically on how Celine looked today .
Is it only him or she was wearing a sexy dress ?
The next thing Michael knew is that he is making love with this girl .
I love you so much ' Michael blurted after what they did then hug her .
He felt a liquid falling on his shoulders .
Is it raining ?
I knew everything .
Everything was just a bet right ? ' Celine said .
Michael got frozen . '
Everything that happened to us was too good to be true .
I should n't have believe that you will change just for me .
I 'm going to dress now ' Celine added .
Michael ca n't believe of what he had just heard .
The next thing he knew is that she was gone not only on his pad but from his life .
He just lost the girl he loved for the first time .
Micheal decided to get dress , he was on the way to the door when he saw a box of things he gave to Celine .
In the presentday community shopping is one of the most important part of life .
For some of us trade is a thing for a living , but other people treat shopping like a good thing to spend time and they are enjoying it very much .
For me , shopping is not enjoyable and I am trying to avoid big shopping centres .
The very first reason for my disagreement is that I do not have enough money to purchase everything which I would like to buy .
Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and furthermore it gives me a big amount of sadness .
The next thing about unpleasant shopping are enormous lines .
Going for a few food - stuffs always end with an hour in a line .
No matter in what time you come to shop , you will wait .
The last , but not least reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a lot to a store in which I can buy everything I want .
Of course I might go to a few different shops , but without driving license travelling is tough task .
Carrying many heavy bags is not my favourite kind of spending my spare - time .
Among all of them , one of the places you must visit in Brazil is the Amazon Theater , located in Manaus , the town of Amazon State , in the north of the country .
The building is important because it was built in the last century during the rubber age , when the city was one of the most richest city in the world .
Architects , builders , painters and sculptors were brought from Europe by ship as well as all the material construction that were necessary for its building .
It is a sophisticated construction , full of details , everywhere around the theater , from the floor to the ceiling , everything carefully fashioned according to that period .
Even if it has more then 100 years since it was built , all the original fashion are still there , intact , with all the luxury ready for everyone 's visit .
The place set out important concerts , presentations and international festivals until nowadays .
During the rubber age there was no urban life around the build , which is completely different from today of course since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater , that have the same age of the theater and is surrounded by art galleries , pubs , offices , houses , restaurants , where groups of friends , tourists and families are used to go to appreciate the breeze in the end of a warm day and during the night .
It really worth visiting Amazon Theater in Manaus , taking pictures and having good stories to tell in your life .
Have you ever heard about it ?
Most of all Girls Play it in my village .
In big cities there 's a similar Sport called Basketball and this one is more for Boys .
Every monday we meet us in the sportshall of Mandach .
Before the lessons begin , we talk about the news in the village and do some exercise to get warm .
After our Trainer Nico shows us a lot tipps an tricks .
The reason I like this Sport is more or less simple .
I can Play it with good friends , it 's a funny Sport , but it 's also hardly and you can get to your Limit .
In winter we have some games every two weeks , where our friends are visitors .
In the last season we reached the second place .
If you want to know more about this Sport , do n't hesitate to watch a game of us .
You can find more informations also in the Internet .
To sum up I hope to see you soon by a game .
In contrast , the professor argues that they were impossibly weapons because they show no damage .
Secondly , the writer claims that the stone balls might be us as standard weights to measure .
The main reason is that the craved stone balls are different types of stones .
It is because different stones have different densities that their weights are different though they are uniform in the same size .
Last but not least importantly , the author asserts that the stone balls might serve a social purpose .
The professor , however , does n't think so because the the designs of the stone balls are too simple to show the important social status .
Moreover , in general , artifact of social symbol is buried with its owner after he or she died .
However , the craved stone balls were not found near any graves .
To sum up , the professor totally disagree with the statement in the reading passage .
In the future some dangerous diseases such as Cancer or Aids will be treated , and there will be no worries about them .
I think people will not go out of their homes to buy goods and foods or clothes , because professional robots will be invented and they will do anything that you want , and they will obey your orders .
However , this can cause a problem for human and some people will face to the threat of compulsory redundancies .
I would say that some problems will happen and people will lose their jobs .
I assume that another problem will be robots , because little by little they will capture the world and they will become human 's enemy , and that would be one of possibilities in the future .
In conclusion , I would say that developing is not very good for human , and little by little the world will be demolished by human errors .
I hope the world will not being destroyed by human , but in the end everyone knows that the entire of the world will be ruined and nobody will be alive .
This is an original and moving love story that has people agaisnt the relationship between the main characters .
And this story was told from the point of view of Leo Colston the lead character .
Moreover , the whole story happens in the 20th century during a trip that Leo does and calls it the best century of his life .

So there he meets the oldest - gorgeous Marcus ' sister and he immediately falls in love and since then the go - between appears in the story .
I think everyone will enjoy this book because it shows a typical way of behaving in the 20th century , their daily - routines and the things they do to have fun .
Besise this , it tries to give us a real idea of what an innocent child may do to help people without being told the real truth .
This paper is a review of scientific researches , including magazines , newspapers , websites and others ; with the purpose of exploring ecotourism , presenting the tourist attractions and beaches to people , in order to call it to their attention in relation to the commercial promotion and local development , where a lot of people do not know the natural beauties of our city .

Throughout the marketing and advertising , we want to encourage young people who enjoy surfing the dissemination of the best beaches of this city to practice it with others that may have .
Preserving , exploring the trails and beaches , encouraging extremist sports are what we believe that attractives to tourists of this wonderful seaside city are .
In today 's world people use public transport in every aspect of travelling .
Nevertheless , travelling by car can be posing a real treath to public transport because it is much more comfortable .
People can go wherever they want and whenever they want without thinking of buying a ticket or getting to a station on time to catch a bus or a train .
Car gives comfort because you can personalise your space and your ride .
All the same car is also necessity today , because very often that is the only means to get to where you need to .
However , public transport is not threatened by car .
First of all , too many cars make towns crowded and create traffic jam , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one car is making as much pollution as one bus which transports many more people .
In my opinion , public transport is secured in the future .
It will even get more popular because it will be faster , modern , and cheaper than a travellng by car .
We had never gone to Michael 's house before .
We were thinking that meeting there we will have a funny night in friends , but we were very wrong .
When we arrived we saw an old house where Michael lived .
When we got inside his house , we saw a lot of old pics on his wall , it was like a horror movie !
After a while , when we were playing one of his Computer game , we heard a scream coming from his garden .
They were Michael 's parents , his father was dead , but his mum no .
When we saw that we escaped as fast as we could , and we saw as his mum walking to find Michael , like a zombie .
In the end , We heard Michael 's scream .
We never see him again , I think that when Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
It was long time ago when I have read this book but it was so good and exciting that it 's still in my mind .
That 's a novel written by Sidney Sheldon called ' ' If tomorrow comes '' .
It talks about an ordinary young woman who has everything she needs in life .
After she finds out that her mother has committed a suicide because of some kind of fraud she decides to revenge her but she gets into a prison .
After she comes out she decides to make another revenge because of the same reason .
This book is very exciting because there is a lot of things that are happening and it 's not monotonous at all .
I would recommend this book to the people of all ages because it has something for everyone .
It is a really good book that should n't bee missed .
Recently , I have seen an advertisement about a job .
I think I would be the right person for such job .
The following are worth noting about me .
I have taken courses in the last 2 months in an organization that prepares activities for children aged between one to 15 .
There main aim is to make the children over the moon .
In addition we were also taught how to organize sports and activities for them in a way they will enjoy .
Moreover , sir , I have taken courses in cooking .
I believe that I am suitable for this job as I have huge experience about what is required . I would be on top of the world if you allow me to be one of the team .
Believe you will never regret choosing me .
Sincerely ,
I did n't expect to find anything else than sand , heat and tourists on my way across the desert , even though I was leading myself to a patch of water among leagues of wasteland , the oasis of Faiyum .
Finally , my plane landed in Cairo almost five hours after I had left England and I had to remember that the time there were two hours in advance .
When I managed to reach the outside I had a taxi waiting for me , probably sent by my mother , so at least I did n't have to look for another one in the stifling heat of the city .
I reached the hotel well in the afternoon , nevertheless , the air was still oppressive and hot like at midday .
I had n't met her since the beginning of last February , and that was five months before then .
The aim of this report is to give some tips for tourist who come to the city . I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping clthes in the city as long as some recommendations .
In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes . You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if you are a shopaholic , it will woth it .
NANY 'S has party dresses and wonderful shoes that you can use on special occasions .
You would fall in love with them as they are pstel colured .
In addition , they often have discounts and offers , so you can get some bargains is you look into the wardrobes .
Linda is a modern shop where you can find the latest fashion in Milano and luxury complements from the most known companies .
Clothes at short price
Despite they are not new clothes , they are usually trendy and with high quality .
If the idea of a street marke does not seduced you , I recommend you visiting a is a little shop in Saint Peter street , The Old Bag , where you can buy bags and other complements such as umbrellas , gloves and scarfs .
In addition , The shop is very cheap and you can take a cup of coffee iside meanwhile you are shopping .
I recommend you having a look inside just in case .
By contrast If you are more lickely to save money , the best option in the street market .
I suggest a quick visit to every shop and make comparations in price and quality
This is a short report which will include my recommendation about the most interesting places in my town for them to enjoy .
I have chosen two most popular places to have a good time in my town .
The first place would be " Culture Centre " and the second one " Sports Centre " .
In the " Culture Centre " your young visitors will be able to join daily cultural activities , such as theater , cinema and drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Centre " they will have an opportunity to join many sports activities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics and karate classes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months , I suggest that they should subscribe to a Polish language course .
It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish language at least on a basic level .
The course will give your young visitors not only a lot of fun but also a general knowledge about Polish culture and eating habits as well .
However , they should be aware of high costs of living in my town .
When I think in food the first thought it comes to my mind is ham , it brings back memories of the Christmas 2012 .
I have fond memories of those Christmas because of the ham and my niece .
In recent years , I have been buying the ham in a shop in Cáceres which is hugely popular and I really enjoy seeing that my family is delighted , but overall I enjoy seeing my niece , who is still a child , eating ham .
Every year , in my house , we play the same role : my mother and my sister prepare different plates for Christmas dinner , and I am highly probably the responsible for carrying those plates from the kitchen to the dining room , because the rest of the family is lost in their conversations trying to save the world .
It was while I was coming in and out from the kitchen I found my niece standing on a side of the table eating ham .
It was an unforgettable moment , I was looking at her slightly excited because she was eating alone without help and fast , which was and still is unusual coming from her .
If there were more buses or trains at any time ( also in the night ) , it could be convenient using them and letting the car in the garage .
Unfortunately it 's not possible because of the costs that the Economic System would be compelled to support .
So people often prefer using the car and paying for oil instead of the bus ticket but having more advantages : not to be constricted to wait for the buses and not to have to take a taxi in the night when they come back from the disco , for example ..
It 's called " City car " or " Car Sharing " and it consists in sharing a car , using it for our movements and then letting it in every part of the city in the dedicated parking .
It 's a cheap service and it 's very appreciated from people who needs car not every day but only for a little time .
So I think that in a short time , cars will take the place of the public transport .
The Internship , a film of Shawn Levy with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn .
In this film there are two not younger men who have lost their work .
They sell clocks , but at a certain time their factory had closed .
They have to find another work .
It is n't easy finding another work for them because they are alone able to sell .
In the beginning , one of them , looks for a job asking to the boyfriend sister , but fortunately his friend convince him to find another work .
One day , finding on google , the two friends discover that google looks for new people to employ in its company .
They send their curriculum .
Of course they are much more older than the other candidates , and when the staff control their curriculum only one member confirm their candidature .
Despite everything they could take part to the competition .
The google agency arranges a lot of people , and declares that only one group will have the possibility to win .
Of course when the groups arrange themselves , the two old men remain alone and they are forced to create a group with the discards .
Of course , on paper , this group haven't chances , but the events will demonstrate something of different .
This film is interested because it drafts work problems but not only for this ; it also transmits some important values like , the importance of the solidarity , the group cohesion and the importance not to lose the fait in dreams even if the situation is withstands .
Of course there are also negative observations about this film : for example there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story : they are n't interesting and they during so much time .
In addition some situations of the film are taken from the high school movie .
In conclusion this film is plain and a little discounted but in the same time light and funny film to watch during the summer with some friends .
If I were you , I would start in Catalonia and I would catch a train which describes a wonderful route .
You travel around all the Spanish coast and you end your trip in Madrid .
So you can see nearly all Spain in a month and it is quite worth , according to my best friend .
The problem is that you have to book the hotels you want to stay so yoou need some time to prepare it .
You should bring summer clothes because it 's very hot at his time of the year , and some jackets since the north of this country can be a little chilly too .
As you know , my father runs a tour agency which needs some new staff and they are looking for people who speak at least three languages .
It is well - paid although you have to spend hours and hours under the sun , but it 's a good idea .
It may help you to choose what to study at university as I know you haven't decided your mind yet .
If you do n't like this idea , there is an excellent website which offers a lot of jobs and maybe you find something interesting .
I enclose for you the name in this e - mail , I think you should take a look !
Please , tell me when you make a decision .
Yours sincerely .
The most are famous because they expose their private life and all their interests are to making money .
The rest of celebrities are artists or good workers .
They do not think in money or fame , simply they enjoy working .
On the one hand , I agree with the statement because everyone has the right to maintain a private life .
It has to be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to asking or to taking photos .
If something changes in your life will be a notice in television , and people will invent rumours about you .
Not know if people take interest in you because they are real fans or is a person who wants to take advantage of you .
On the other hand , I disagree with the statement because if they are public people , fans will interest in them .
There are celebrities that sell their life in television and then do not want to journalists chase them .
There are other famous people who not appear in television and they are chased by reporters .
This is the result that something new has occurred and they want to collect information .
It is impossible to take a private life if you are a celebrity , because people who love you want to know about your privacy .
To summarize , if you expose yourself to television you will not have a private life .
The best way to keep it is not be a famous person .
Last winter I had been working as a coach in my basketball team with kids about ten years old .
I have formation in basketball and Physical Educations .
For me this is very pleasant because I like being with children and it is a challenge for me .
Moreover I am very active and hardworking as you request .
In addition I am very funny and always I am joking .
It is not a problem for me to work in the kitchens because I cook on my house and I think I do very well .
Also I feel that I can be a positive incorporation in the Summer Camps .
Yours sincerely
Have you ever thought about how the home of the Future would look like ?
It would be different from nowadays ?
Many of us think that the home of the future will be exactly like in our favourite sciean - ficions movies or books , for example , " Solaris " or even " Star Wars " .
House , which in we will be life in the future , would be full of complicated to use computers and robots .
Televion of the future will be amiazing , because it will have a 3D projector , what makes that movies will look extremely realistic .
Remarkable will be of course robots , which will help us in every day responsibilities , for instance in cooking delicious dishes , cleaning every thing in the house or even in washing and ironing clothes .
To be perfectly honest , ever human - being is dreaming of the home of the Future and ever dream is an individual , but in the future , our dreams will come true ?
Whether you want to visit some interesting place or building , you should go to our zoo , which is near Zlín in Lešná .
There is a nice old chateau and a lot of animals , which are from the whole world .
You can see for example tigers , lions , zebras , birds , pinguins or horses .
In the chateau is an exhibition of snakes and spiders .
It 's a beautiful place for every generations in nature and you can spend there all day .
If you were hungery , there are some restaurants a fast foods .
But the main reason is , that Zlín zoo is one of the biggest zoos in Czech Republic and , in my opinion , the most beautiful .
Please write to me back and tell me , if you like the zoo or if you went on other place .
On my opinion sometimes stars ' behaviour is very suprising .
On the hand famous people intend to protect their private live , but on the other hand they want to be followed by paparazzi .
First of all being on the covers of rags help them make their more attractive for directors .
The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable , because popularity give possibility to earn more money .
Hollywood fees depend not only on skills but first of all on fame of this person .
Film stars have very duties for example going to the parties organized by other people from show buissness .
Dear Jeff ;
Honestly , I do not like Nature Programmes so much because they are so boring !
I personally like Sports Programmes and Comedy Shows , because I love sports and also enjoy having a good laugh .
My favourite tv shows are " Hablemos de Football " , " Sports Center " , " Fox Sport " and " The Simpsons " , all these except " The Simpsons " are about sports , mainly football , basketball and rugby .
I watch tv about 5 hours a day and in the weekends about 6 hours because I can stay in bed till late .
I watch some football matches repetitions and Comedy Shows .
And I would like to know what is the most popular programme among teenagers in your country

I enjoyed the past summer holiday , it is entertaining and I usually travel around Hong Kong with my family during weekends .
I have been to several places during the holiday , including airport , Mui Wo , West Kowloon Cultural District , etc .
The summer holiday was quite long , nearly two months .
I usually wake up at around nine O Clock in the morning and spend the day by reading newspapers , books , and also digitalize some video tapes .
I enjoy reading newspapers so I can get updates on the latest development of incidents and news .
I usually watch television programs from Discovery Network at night .
Besides , I find those talking about building massive structures and science interesting and I learnt some knowledge from those programs .
To get prepared to the things to be taught in grade 9 , I also flipped through some textbooks , including Integrated Science , Geography , etc .
And I find the knowledge to be taught in some subjects interesting , while some are n't .
Despite the hard work , I enjoyed the process of preparing the competition a lot .
Nowadays the level of our life has become higher .
So a public transport is not exception .
Most people prefer using their private car instead of a public transport .
Basically , there are a lot of drawbacks using this kind of transport .
First of all is a traffic jam , if you stick in a traffic jam in a big bus you will waste much time then you expected on the road . Bisedes a public transport are overloaded at rush hours .Another downside is that most of buses are old and dirty .
That 's why people choose travelling by car because it ' is more convenient and fast .
Most of my time I like hanging out and chilling with my friends , but when I am not with my friends , I am home studying .
I have one big sister , Anisa , she is 18 years old , and I also have two younger sisters ; Alicia 8 years old and Isabel 4 years old .
I have many hobbies , but one of my favourite hobbies is to ski downhill , because I love doing it .
The aim of this report is to explain the way our Community have decided to preserve the nature of our town and which other activities could be useful in order to achieve this purpose .
On the one hand , if you belong to a School you can participate giving information to the children about the cathastrophic image our village would have if we do not reduce the pollution in the minimum range .
On the other hand , everyone has the opportunity to clean the streets where they spend most of the time .
Nobody has to be worried about the vacuum or the broom because it is provided by the Government .
In case you do not have time to help with that kind of activities there is a rule you must follow .
A high number of tourists visits Cáceres searching for culture , heritage and typical food from Extremadura .
For that reason , this town has a lot of facilities to cover that demand and to offer a good time inside .
The old town is an historic and cultural center where a great part of the tourism is focused in .
This part of the city is ready to receive it because there is an intensive control to have access to the old town with cars .
Anyway , taxis and official vehicles are free to enter whenever they want .
One of the most particular things of this region is the food and Cáceres is the head city of gastronomy in Europe .
Currently , Cáceres is the only Spanish city having a European award for offering a big selection of food and drink .
" Atrio " is the most important restaurant of the city and it has been recognised with two stars of the most famous guide for restaurant from Spain .
Anyway , " Atrio " is not just a fine food restaurant , but it is a five - stars hotel in the middle of the old town .
Almost , Cáceres has a great offer if someone wants to buy other things like clothes , souvenirs and art .
Pintores street is the commercial place of the city and it has a great selection of shops and restaurants with typical food from Spain .
Garlic is a plant , member of the lily family , with an odor and a taste characteristic .
It is known by Human history at least since 3000 B.C. In many cultures , garlic is associated with superstitions , providing bad or good lucky .
In Ancient Egypt , garlic was used by people for heath purposes .
The slaves , who constructed pyramids , were fed with garlic , because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger , so they could work harder .
In Roman and Greek cultures , people believed in garlic 's magic powers to avoid the Evil .
Even Homer cited garlic in his odyssey .
In Middle Ages , sailors carried garlic with them to endure long periods in the seas .
In more recent years , in the World War I , soldiers used garlic to prevent from gangrene .
At the present time , modern Science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption in human health .
Experiments made with garlic and some types of bacteria , revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria .
Thereby , the bactericidal effect of the garlic , probably can explain some ancients ' beliefs that this plant can help in some illness treatments .
It can explain too , why the use of garlic was a good option to prevent gangrene in WWI .
Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic in blood system .
Therefore , include garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health as some cultures believed .
How many of us today are really into helping the environment .
There are lot of campaigns going on globally .
Is it worth all the time , energy and money in convincing people to be responsible to their environment ?
I recently joined a campaign program in Manila , Philippines dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources .
I was very enthusiastic in all the activities not until after that one event .
I found out that the leaders of this organization are not realizing the beliefs and principles they are imparting to the public .
They are not a good representation of their ideals .
I backed off and decided to just continue to do my personal contribution in helping mother earth .
Maybe we can not convince the whole world participate in helping the environment right away , but it can begin with ourselves .
After my awareness of what was happening in our natural resources , I am very glad to have been doing my part .
I am now living an environment - friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago .
Firstly , I cycle everyday to work .
This just did n't save me from too much gasoline expenses , but it also made me physically fit .
At home I have separate garbage bins for paper , plastic and organic wastes .
Forthly , I am only buying organic products for consumption and keeping a small spice garden at my backyard .
And finally , I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing inorder to help our environment .
All in all , I think that helping our environment does n't have to be big time . We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable nor irrevocable .
We can begin in ourselves , in our family , in our own homes .
That is a small start , but will eventually reap a huge outcome .
To begin with I would like to tell you that I am really interested in the course because I think it would provide me some professional advantages have in my career as a school teacher .
Learning languages is increasingly important in the teaching sector so I want to improve it .
I would be able to spend three months in a intensive course in spring .
Starting in April or May could be right for my schedule .
I reckon my weak points are speaking and listening skills nevertheless I would be also interested in working over writing and grammar points .
Although I am in my late forties I am still very active so I like practising sports , music and going to the cinema as well .
Yours Sincerely .
Michael is an American guy , living in and studying in the Netherlands at the Leiden University .
He lives in the Netherlands for about a year .
He had chosen to study Amsterdam because he loves that city , it 's his dream city and he loves canals and the Amsterdam 's lifestyle .
One day he went out with couples of friends , they went to a night club called " Miami beach".They were dancing and having fun and then he saw a beautiful girl and she could n't take her eyes of him , so he decided to go and talk to her .
She was very kind and she was smiling all the time , he offered her a drink and late in the night they went to her house where they spend the night together .
The day after , he woke up with a hangover and realized that he had made love unsafe .
i looked back and i noticed that the earth was strange .
Moved by my curiosity i dug up and found a paper which contained a map .
Without a second thought i decided to follow the directions on the puzzling map .
I did nt know what i was going to find at the end of my hunt but this idea made the situation even more exciting .
The directions took me along a path towards a cave and i went into it .
I had been wellprepared and i carried a lantern .
I walked through the darkness and finally i arrived at a stunning lake .
There was a boat by the share and as soon as i went on board it started to move .
A few meters ahead i saw a blinding light and i realized that i was nt alone because i could hear the sound of the music and people talking .
Dazzled by the sun when i opened my eyes i realized that i was in a wonderful funfair .
My relatives and friends had prepared a surprise birthday party that i will never forget .
I know you 're looking for interesting place to visit so I want to offer you place where you can rest , have a lot of fun and spend great time with your group .
I want to recommend the amusement park , one of the most interesting place to visit here .
On the face of it it sounds childishly but I think it 's a good way to spend free time even for adults .
This is a huge amusement park with many attraction for young people looking for excitement .
There 's also something for someone who do n't like risky play .
The amusement park and aqua park are located close the centre so you do n't have to go far away .
First and formast , the bank notes should be designed and the design includes background colour , artwork and securityissues .
Going forward , it should be the preparation of metal plates .
In this step , skilled machinists is required .
Then print the banknote .
In this stage , pay attention to the colour , special ink and images slightly raised is necessary .
Last but most important step is the ispection .
In this step , the workers should tell the good quality sheets from the band ones .
If the sheets is in good quality , it will be cut into separate notes , packed and
If the sheest is in bad quality , it will be securely destroyed .
There will be a third situation .
The difference is the good part will be kept while the bad part will be destroyed .
Well , I 'm sorry but , although I studied French when I was young , I have forgotten almost all .
So , I 've tried to translate your French on Google translator and I 've could n't understand what you mean about my English and Google translator . I 'm used to write English and I have an intermediate level .
It is n't easy at all , they 're too different languages , and I prefer to use the software " Grammarly spellchecker " to get some help .
Anyway if you want to know my level I can tell you I 've finished the level B1 .
I will start the level B2 the next course .
I think you do n't know our national team .
There is a new and stunning basketball players generation .
Mirotic , Ibaka , Claver , Marc Gasol ( and his younger brother is all a promise ) Therefore we 'll have Paul Gasol 's brothers at least for ten years more but also , Felipe Reyes , Rudy Fernadez , Sergio Rodriguez , Sergio Llul , Calderón are young still .
I 'm sorry to tell you , but we are going to have an awesome team for a long time still .
I think you do n't follow the American news .
Indeed , his team was almost at the end of the NBA teams whilst they are in the middle position now .
It is n't only that he 's a very good player ( He is :D ) but also , thanks to his style of play , his assists , and points has served as a lever to his team that has improved dramatically .
He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old .
His current team is preparing him physically in the gym , his physical form has improved a lot and now is faster , stronger and he 's still 23 years old .
Watching him play is a delight , especially his assists and juggling games while he looks at the opposite direction .
I really enjoy watching him to play a lot .
The " Di roma reataurant " is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village " Monção " is very popular , between teenagers and adults who love to eat pizza or any other fast food .
Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop - like kitchen where you can see the chefs working , so you can see how they make the food that you will eat .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the region , who are very popular around the country .
The service is always great , the clients do n't have to wait a long time until the dish is done , while clients are waiting they always give a Indian food .
The price of the food is very cheap , takin into account the quality .
For this reason I highly recommend going to Di Roma restaurant .
I recently tried to ask you some questions through your " Ask Me " section in your site , but it said :
Please can you tell me some websites where I can learn how to style , how to combine clothes and something like that ?
whenever I search on Google " men fashion " , I only find stuff for mature men .
The problem is that I 'm only sixteen ... what could I do ?
Public transport is not as valorated as it should be although a lot of people uses it every day .
Firstly , it is very good for the environment because it reduces a lot of carbon dioxide gasses which if everybody took the car instead of taking public transport would pollute the atmosphere
Secondly , travelling in public transport makes much easier to travel at rush hours or on those moments in which you should not take the car
Finally , it is a good way of travelling because it is safer than travelling in a car or in a motorbike and also in the way that you are much relaxed than in a car and it saves time too .
To conclude public transport is good for the environment , it makes much easier and cheaper to travel , and it , in some way , saves lives .
For those reasons and some others I think that public transport must be there for many years .
A big city with more than one million people .
I live in a little part of stockholm called Danderyd .
Because Danderyd is n't in the city it 's very much nature and nice people .
It 's a big country and does n't have many inhibitants .
It 's one of the biggest countries in Europe if you think about the area Sweden have .
Anyway , about one thousand years ago Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Norway was Vikings .
The Vikings where like pirates that lived in the countries I was talking about one thousand years ago .
But they also where the ones that first discovered Greenland , North America and Asia .
The Vikings where feared from most people in Europe but they where also merchants and explorers .
The most people in Sweden are christians .
But because Sweden accept so many people to flee to Sweden from the wars in the northern parts of Africa and the southwest parts of Asia .
The nature in Sweden can be very cold , especially in the northern parts of Sweden .
If you are at the most northern part of Sweden it 's always day in the summer and always night in the winter .
Also when it 's winter you can see something called the northern light .
Some just travel to Sweden just to see it .
Most people go to highschool and unversity .
There are though a problem with jobs .
In Sweden we are very proud of a free download able program where you can listen to almost all the music in the world .
It 's called Spotify and have grown super big .
There is also another free program that is called Skype where you can talk to eachother and text eachother totally free !
In Sweden gaming is really big and there is also one game maker that have made a game called BF or Battle Field .
It have been a great succes and is one of the best games in the world .
Even though we have a lot to be proud of we need to make a lot of things better .
In Sweden we have a lot of different people from different kultures .
The problem is that there are a lot of swedish people that are razists .
Not the majority of course but there are many razists .
That can be really painfull for those who is n't from Sweden from the beginning .
Or for those who does n't have swedish culture .
Also as I said before we need more jobs .
After the handover in 1997 , it becomes a special administrative region of China .
The location of Hong Kong is in Asia , and its location seems to be a bridge between China and worldwide .
Since it is located in a specific area between China and the western , both cultures are also being popular in there .
Despite the land in Hong Kong is just 1,100 sq.km , 7.2 millions citizens are living in there .
From 1980 's , it is developed as an international financial centre and so many global investors have set up their headquarters in there .
Compare with other developed countries , Hong Kong 's economy is stable and competing with Singapore to be the prime leader of the Asia .
For languages , Chinese and English are the main languages which using in Hong Kong .
For the education , every developed country is concerning with the issue .
Hong Kong government has invested lots of capital to develop a better education system for building a knowledge - based society and the better future .
It is providing 12-year free education to every child and they must be educated for at least 9 years .
As mentioned , Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China , those systems and laws are different from Mainland China .
Residents in Hong Kong are enjoying highly - freedom in religion , speech , organizational , activities , going abroad during the life .
Owing to those separated characteristics , actually , Hong Kong can be described as a colourful and brilliant city .
Going places is of paramount importance for people , and going quickly even more ; that 's why I think public transport is not the most efficient way to go places .
The use of public transport takes more time than using the car , which can be considered as a waste of time .
You are dependent on schedules when you use public means of transport , that is to say you can not begin your journey when you want .
You must wait for the right time of departure and you must be at the departure point at due time , which implies getting to that specific place by any other means of transport .
All this makes using the car much convenient due to the fact that not only do you leave when you want , but also straight away from the very door of your own house .
When you go by car you may control your timing , stop at will and if you go with someone else , it may be cheaper : provided the cost of the journey will be the same , no matter how many passengers you take with you ; while on public transport you should pay a ticket for every single rider .
Anyway , to tell you the truth I 'd rather take a train , for instance , it means travelling in a relaxing way , not running risks of accidents , having the chance to read or play " travelling " chess , meeting new people , as in a stage coach but moving faster
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which appears in this month 's edition of EnglishAcademy magazine .
As you will see from my enclosed CV , I have worked the last three years as a personal assistant of a director of a well - known international company based in London while I am finishing my part - time degree in Modern Languages ( English - German ) .
Throughout my work history and studies I have displayed excellent teamwork and people - oriented skills which I believe are crucial capacities in an administrative position .
As well as I have also work under pressure and meet deadlines without any problem because I am used to be resourceful and manage time efficiently .
In addition , I have excellent customer service skills and am highly efficient with the use of computers in a wide variety of applications .
I would genuinely welcome the opportunity of an offer to work for your language school .
I do n't know what I have to say but the only thing that I know is that my English pronunciation is not very good .
I want to improve my English pronunciation skills so I can be able to understand native speakers .
I have an American girlfriend and she is very fluent in English because it is her mother language .
I want is to be fluent so she can understand what I want to tell her .
I want to tell her too many things about my feelings toward her but I do n't know how to say that .
Now I decided to improve my writing skills because once it became improved I would be very happy and I think that my ideas ' expression will be good .
I think that my pronunciation will be good when I can speak for a long period of time and in all life aspects .
So now I have two main purposes .
The first one is to study a lot of Grammer lessons and the second one is to learn how to organize my ideas for a long period of time speaking .
Thank you for sending me the correct form of my writing and I am really appreciate that very much .
His name is Mohamed but he is normally called Franco , an easier name to use in Italy , the Country where he is working .
Mohamed is from Senegal , 33 years old , graduated in education with a master in education for children and people with special needs .
He completed his studies six years ago but since then he was unable to find a proper employment in his Country .
Therefore , he decided to migrate looking for better job opportunities .
After a complex and difficult journey , Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coasts in 2011.Helped by a Senegalese community , he has eventually found a job as a fruit seller in a local market .
Despite his high qualified studies in education , Mohamed had to carry on a job in a completely different field .
The phenomenon of immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last decades .
However , nowadays even in the rich Western Europe , many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find an employment .
This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other Countries .
Unlike the post - War society , where the European economy was booming , since more than 5 years , Europe is suffering from a profound economic crisis whose major effects are borne by the youths , including the highly qualified graduates .
Such a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools , which has failed to adapt to the changes brought in the society by globalization .
Therefore , once graduated , qualified youths find themselves to face both the economic crisis and a hostile job market .
I believe that Governments from different Countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and , therefore , contribute to worsen the impact of the economic crisis .
I go cycling and running regularly so I think I could define myself a sportswoman .
I am a passionate reader in particular of thrillers and French poetry .
My passion for travels goes back in years to when I was just a child : As I am a curious person I like tasting new foods and discover new places .
I like to think of myself as a go - getter so I always try to keep myself active .
I am not a class act yet I try to do my best , so if I have to work in a team I am the mover and shaker of the group .
However , as I tend to be set in my ways sometimes I can appear a know - it - all or too pragmatic .
I would like to be part of this project as next year I will have to live at miles of distance from my parents in order to study Medicine .
Therefore I think this experience of three months can offer me a unique chance of growing as a person and better understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent .
Indeed following a routine of work would allow me to put my mind in gear and study two or three hours a day .
In addition probably this project is the best chance of really getting to know more about the Baltic Republics .
A couple years ago I have spent a couple weeks in Bright with Ef .
During this period I have shared a room with two Finnish girls in a foster family .
We got on like a house on fire and I still keep several wonderful memories .
Therefore I would be more than willing to share this experience with another student .
As the 6th of September there is going to be the university entry test for Medicine , I will have to flight back to Italy for a couple days .
Last year I did some graphic designs for the website of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addition , last year I participated in a stage at the ASL of Rivoli .
Is it true ? I agree with this statement .
Because , when we decided to go for a shopping and have an idea what we want to buy and it appears that we ca n't find what we want , we are disappointed and frustrated .
Sometimes , shopping - particularly for women - is the best way to ameliorate the mood .
For example when they find what they want , or find something in a smaller size , or just find a trifle and are happy .
Unfortunately , shopping also can bring displeasure .
For example , when we staying at the queue , coming to the cash register and it appears that the price on the label is more expensive .
As we know it , for women shopping is the best way to relax but for men is just a torture .
I think that if there is no public transport in the future , the traffic will be a totally mass !
Because everybody drive their cars and motorcycles on road that the traffic jam will not only be the serious problem to the government but also be the safe problem to citizens .
More vehicle on road that means more car accidents happening .
Therefore , the government need to make a good traffic policy to ensure citizen 's safety and welfare of have privilege of driving on road .
If there is so much vehicle on road , it may cause several problems .
One is that people may stuck in the traffic jam during the rush hours , the second is the more vehicle on road that means the more exhaust would be emitted into the air , the last and the most important is the gas and oil would be depleted .
In a result , I think if traveling only by car is not a wise choice for earth although it is convenient .
But we need to think that there is a better way to protect the earth and human 's environment such as riding bicycle or waiting for environmental - friendly car being invented .
The lifestyle of the people has changed completely in the past 20 years .
Cars Symbolize wealth .
Many people have to travel longer distances to work , and most often their only working tool is the car own .
In addition most of the people are not used to walking on foot even in short distances .
In big cities where people live a more isolated life and always in a hurry .
In those cities where the number of the residents is over a million , public transport system is widely used .
Students often use public transport between cities instead of cars .
There are many people who have experienced a carcrash , or just simply afraid of driving , so they prefer to use public transport system .
Those people who has mental or other serious illness does n't allowed or not able to drive a car , for them public transport system is necessary .
Not to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers ' life and it is less about convenience even if travelling by car means you do n't need to adjust to other passengers .
I agree with that there is a lower demand for public transport in smaller cities and towns , but it does n't mean it has no future .
I 'm from Ecuador a country surrounded by a great number of natural resources .
We are an underdeveloped country , like other countries says a " third world country " , but I 'm happy about that .
, because we see develop countries and the form that they use the resources .
We see what they really are , the underdeveloped countries that they are .
Seeing all of it we will change our future , doing different things that they have done .
Recently my country is starting to develop their resources , our renewable energy as wind , solar , hydropower , geothermal energy .
Nowadays , we really focus on how we can extract this energy , but not in other important things , like the way that we can start to use it , the correct use that we could give them or how we can reuse the energy .
Starting to develop our nation , it is eventually starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment .
Traditional energies are focus on give to big cities all the resources .
Poor people leave their towns to look for a better live , but if we start to give them enough resources and decrease their migration to the big cities , the need of energy would be decreased .
Also it is a big opportunity to help them .
They need resources to improve their live condition until my country could has the possibility to give them a better live opportunities .
It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is big cities , without looking and help the surroundings .
Nowadays my country have started to build a great number of hydroelectric , wind parks and we also starting to think on geothermal energy .
But I think one thing that it is necessary before implementing this type of energies .
All of that require further studies have been done and with that , we could know the feasibility of the projects and the size of them .
Implementation takes time and money , but if the project does not work all of that could be spent in vain .
Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then build large constructions to extract them .
Sustainability is about found the better way to interact with the environment .
It is like to make friendship with nature and knows that what it needs of us and show what we need of it .
As I said before all of it needs time and a great number of studies .
Starting to interest in alternative energy and try to see forms to use in your native country is the first step .
The implementation of projects not need to be only for spending money .
In a good way implementation of projects helps to improve citizens lifes .
All those little steps help to our nation to build a developed country , friendly with the environment .
I live in one of the most polluted city in India and which is also the capital of India i.e. Delhi .
It makes mandatory for the inter - city buses , commercial vehicles and other heavy vehicles to use Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG)instead of diesel .
It encourages people to plant more trees and cutting of them have been made a punishable offence .
Burning of leaves and other waste products have also been made punishable offences .
Recently , for the protection of environment , the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehicles of more than 15 years .
Gradually , people of the city are getting cautious with respect to the environment and they are trying best of them to keep it clean and safe .
People are inculcating the habit to dispose garbage at a defined space .
They are conserving rain water using rain water harvesting process .
They are trying to reduce dependency on private vehicles and switching on public transport mode .
Installation of solar heater , solar lights , use solar cell watches and driving electric cars are in vogue in the city .
I really enjoy soap opera I have seen a lot of them , but in my opinion de best one is an English one called fawlty Towers .
It was writing by John Clees and Conni Both and it shows de daily life in a fictious hotel .
There are four main characteres the owner 's hotel a moody man and his bossy wife , and the workers a pleasant maid and a Spanish waiter who does n't speak English .
In every chapter new clients go to this hotel and have a lot of crazy , funny and sarcastic situations , between workers , owners and customers .
Particulary when the owner gives orders at the waiter , this situations became hilarious .
It was a shorter soap opera , only ten chapters , but at the end it seems you know them for a long time .
I recommend it to enjoy .
Its shorters stories have have a funny and relaxed time .
As the technology develops rather rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon now for us to find that large - scale buildings and transport networks are to be built for the sake of human 's economy , which means vast areas of farmland , forest and wetland are on the way of being ruined .
Fitst of all , the environment that belongs to both man and wild lives is going to lose balance in the ecosystem .
It indicates that more kinds of species are endagered for they are unable to adapt themselves to the remaining lands .
Vegetables and other food planting on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of human may not be meet one day .
Thus , the sea level will go up to influence the climate leading to warmer days in the whole world .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's critical for governments to take mesures to reduce the problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principles should be put up to forbid extravagent expansion in the natural system .
In addition , supervision of the protecting steps need to be undertanken by the government .
What 's more , the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually , no matter in campus or in the public places .
Anyway , to key to protect our living environment from being destroyed is to do it by we indivisuals step by step .
I 'm looking for à language centre which prepare students to take a Cambridge exams especially the F.C.E. On reading the newspaper , I 've heard about your classes and your method seems efficient .
So I wonder if I could apply in one of your course .
As I 've been taking a year off , I am available at any time in the week .
I 've been living in Ireland since last August in order to practise my English language but I need to improve my spelling and my writing as well .
I am interested in applying in one to one class in order to study the most efficient I can .
Will you give me more information about it as soon as possible in order to book in quickly .
( how much ?
When I opened the door imagine my surprise !
Anyway , the man was wearing an orange costume , he was surprisingly tall and slim and he was completely bald except for a long black ponytail coming out from the head .
When he stopped , he gave me a coloured bracelet that it would make me happier .
I was so glad to have had this comic moment that I gave him a little offer and I invited him to come back again !
I met her in second grade , we were queuing to go to class , that was the moment I saw her .
At that time , I did n't have many friends , she helped me to overcome my problems and trust myself .
We never hid anything from each other .
8 years later she has become my best friend , my lost sister , my complement .
He forgot he had a doctor 's appointment and he was running late .
Once on the car , he starts to drive like a maniac .
How could he forgot the time of his appointment ?
He still needs to find an ATM to withdrawl some money to pay for his appointment .
Once he finds one he pulls up the car and goes as fast as he can to get some money .
Hopefully for the next time he will set up a reminder to avoid this again .
Because public transport does not operate 24 hours a day , means people have to follow a schedule .
Furthermore , there are certain forms of transportation , such as trains , that do not travel to the suburbs , so people either have to walk long distances to reach the nearest stop or be dependent on one form of public transport to catch another which can be a great source of stress if there is ever a delay .
When it comes to the issue if Pets can be like our family .
Some people suggest that we have to avoid treating them this way , while the others maintain the opposite view .
As far as I am concerned , the later point of view carries more weight .
I am inclined to believe that pets can be treated as a family members because they are loyal , have souls as well as they are human friends .
First of all , Dogs and cats are a very loyal creatures .
There are many dogs who are loyal and trustworthy than many people in the earth .
Many dogs for example help their owners and protect them from many dangers .
For illustration , My friend has a dog , one day when they were in his farm .
A snake tried to bite my friend but his dog at the last moment saves him and took that snake away .
He made an action which many other people could not .
For that reason I appreciate my pets as if they are one of my friends .
Secondly , reason for my propensity of treating pets as a family member , is that they have souls .
they feel as if they are humans .
They feel our love towards them and they can exchange this love with us .
Everyone has to treat them in a kind way .
They will never try to hurt any human being so why people try to hurt them .
Domestic animals are a very sensitive creatures that we have to treat them as our babies .
Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered as human friends .
We can talk , walk and hangout with them .
Many people can talk with their pets as if they understand them .
One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pets as they are their psychiatrist .
When I see him and ask him how do you do .
He always told me that we are fine referring to him and his cat .
After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness .
I do not mind or fear living alone anymore as I have my friend which is my cat .
To sum up , as a person reaches adulthood , he needs to decide weather to be a human or not .
He has to choose between treating his pets as a family member or not .
Since they are creatures like us have souls and feelings .
It was in Martin 's party where there was amazing music and lots of people .
I haven't heard anything about you since then .
What have you been up to ? I ' ve just started a new job in an important French business .
The city where I live is nice with gardens and what 's more , a huge lake .
I used to go running there .

I am writing to you with the reference to your advertisement which I saw in the " Daily News " .
I am sixteen years of age , pursuing a degree of Intermediate at Imperial College , assiduous to work .
I really find this job useful for me as I have a heart to be with children and want to earn for myself .
I have gained some experience of working with children while baby - sitting of my cousins the previous year .
I am a fluent English speaker as I had a chance to pass my childhood at Kent .
Moreover , I got a diploma of English reading and writing skills .
I would feel relieved if you would let me know about the commencement of the program as I can travel in this month and the salary offered per week .
Please do not resist contacting me if any further information is required .
A SEAWEED : OUR FUTUR
I was beginning to work in a research center about Energy .
Unfortunately , my scholarship was ending and I was thinking about backing home .
I liked a lot my project and I wanted to follow in it but my project manager was worried .
We were five people .
It was my boss , he told me : " Go ahead ! , the project follows ! " .
I hung up the phone and I go out to celebrate the moment with my colleagues .
Thanks for a crowd funding campaign , we obtained the mininum funds to develop our innovate work .
We only needed a water tank and the Sun .
The energy of the Sun was the food for the seaweeds and they stored it in their cells .
Unforturnately , the process only gone on twelve hours .
Our goal was increasing the storage capacity in several days .
The public administration helped us when we showed our solutions .
Nowadays , our team have grown up and we are thirty people .
We are going to build an industrial plant to achieve our dream : storing renewable energies without using toxic materials and mining commodities from the Earth .
He realized that he had forgotten to finish his homework ; therefore , he ran back home quickly , and start finishing his homework .
While Peter is doing his homework , his best friend - Tommy , invited Peter to play football together at night .
However , Peter decided to reject Tommy 's invitation , and continue to do his homework .
Ten minutes later , he felt bored and wanted to play some video games , but he had lots of homework to be done .
After that , he took a deep breath on his bed and made his final decision : he decided to keep on do his homework and project .
On the next day , he handed in his homework to his teacher and he got the highest mark in his class .
She was about to start an important trip , an essential change on his life .
Maybe the day itself would n't be extraordinary , but , for sure , she will remember it all her life .
In the near future , she will explain this day to her friends in a pub , probably her new friends .
Not everyday you leave your country without knowing when and why you will come back .
Anna woke up at half past nine when the clock rang .
The first she saw was a perfectly packed suitcase near her bed .
The day before all the clothes which were inside the luggage had been classified on the bed : trousers , spring t - shirts , nightdresses and so on .
She was doing all the routine activities automatically , thinking in her next journey .
She had lived abroad several times but she never has gone without knowing her return .
On that moment , Spain was an unfair country .
She was trying to find a job for a year but she was n't lucky at all .
She was graduated , had even studied a Master and she had nothing to lose .
It was not easy to leave a daughter go on her own .
They think that big - name has marvellous life with no problems , no duties , or worries .
They think that this group of people has just a better life and things are going very well .
But people should realized , that there are many advantages and disadvantages of being celebrities .
Basically , famous figure has no privacy .
They ca n't go to the cinema , or theatre , or just go for a walk without being recognised .
No matter where famous person goes , he must realized , that next day he will be on first page newspepers with lots of rumours .
Beacuse , what is proper in living when journalist following every step the famous person takes ?
We all are free people and everone deserve to have his own life .
In my opinion journalist and other people should accepted and respected it and sometimes they should just let go .
So , I think , that they must have known about the consequences and just live as they like .
I have seen the advertisement of the vacancy in your cafe in the local newspaper and would like to apply for this position .

The name of this construction is related to two reasons : one reason is related at the dimensions of the building , the second reason is because near there is a bronze statue .
In 1990 the Colosseum was put into the list of the heritage of humanity UNESCO while in 2007 it was included among the new Seven Wonders of the World .
The name Colosseum spread only in the Middle Ages , in Ancient times it was used for gladiators shows and for other public shows .
Three Roman emperors built totally the Colosseum and they were Vespasian , Titus and Domitian .
Finally I can say that the Colosseum it 's a fantastic construction as for beauty as for importance and if a tourist came in Italy for the first time he should see the Colosseum
dear Sir ,
I wish to express my dissastifaction with this course .
The first lesson was about painting , but because of the lack of equipment , we could not painting .
There were not enough brushes and colours for all the students .
perphaps because we were too many people and also , the more people we are , the more space we need and the room was too small .
We felt hot and he had not any refeshment facilities .
When we complained to the course teacher , we were told that things do not depend on him .
He was not helpful and unpolite .
It was the first class , but as a teacher he could have had other behaviour .
I would like to learn in this art course , but you should solve the problems or improve them .
My perfect hotel would be near to the beach , in the Mediterranean coast , because in this area there are many tourists .
The hotel would be luxorius but everybody could come because the prices would be low , so the hotel would be always full , I think that many people want to go to a luxorius hotel but they ca n't .
The hotel would have many services and facilities like a good reception , spa , wifi conection and pay TV in the rooms , a great chef who did the dishes of the mediterranean cuisine , a swimming pool , a bar in the beach and a boat for trips around the mediterranean sea .
I would like to hear the point of vieuw of tourists to improve the hotel .
This is the hotel of my dreams , but the most important is that the people were happy in their accommodation , if they are happy they will return next year .
One day a friend of mine was going to an amatuer theatre to see a musical and asked me if I would fancy joining her ; I am not fond of musicals , even though I went .
The peformance turned out to be pleasing , with a lot of witty jokes .
After the show I was introdused to one of the actors , who was my friend 's cousin .
I wandered if he was planning to enter any drama school .
Anyway , it is only one side - What do we know about the flipside of fame ?
They can do nothing that could n't be gossipped about .
They are even not allowed to have anything for their own .
Paparazzoes make public their day - to - day routine , hobbies and passions .
When it turns out that all who we got used to idolise are just people with their shortcomings , we become disappointed .
Why do n't we want to give people entertaning us a chance to be themselves and to have a really private life ?
It 's one of the best tv cooking programme that I have ever seen and I absolutely agree with you when you say that this programme promotes the individual and collective work .
I have a friend who went to MASTERCHEF and he taught to the amateur cooks how to make bread .
It all began a rainy morning of July , school 's out for 10 days and as a results of bad grades at school , Michael is forced to pass the summer with his hateful and rich cousins .
They are more beautiful and popular than he , all girls are in love with their and all boys would pay to participate in their parties , including Michael and their friends , who were always excluded .
" I would say stop the arrogance by my cousins " said Michael to your friend and thought to steal the keys of one of their millionar house and take a party with his friend .
In the end , the party turned out a success , for Michael was the beginning of his popularity .
But the house was destroyed and the neighborhood furred for the confusion caused during the night had called the police that without his knowledge waiting outside the house Micheal to take him to the police station .
After everything that had happened Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake
Dear Peter .

Think about your family , is it important to you ?
It should be because it helped you to be what you are today !
As I am 13 year younger than my brother , our parents stay more time with me than with him .
While he is already working and sharing a house with is wife and his daughter , I need mom and dad to live .
In a family , responsibilities increase with age . I have some , not a lot .
Sometimes I have to take care of my little cousins or my neace , clean my bedroom , not much .
Nowadays Environmental issues have become a great concern for scientist as the problem is growing .
However , layman people seem not to worry about the issue very much .
Transport has always been a mayor problem .
Peolpe have never taken into account that fact .
Another mayor problem is lack of recycling .
If people recycles , rubbish will be given a second use , and rubbish dumps will be shrunk .
All in all it seems that if such tiny changes are made , a huge help to save natural resourse will be done .

She just felt it under her skin .
She always believed in such premonition .
Even though she had forgotten to turn on her alarm clock , she woke up at 7 sharp as she wanted the day before .
The weather outside the window were totally different .
She made herself a cup of a very aromatic coffee and she did n't even burn toasts as usual !
Suddenly , she looked at the calendar on the fridge and realized that today 's her birthday .
Moreover , the next day her party is held .
She quickly packed her hand bag and ran out for a bus to university .
At classes everyone was very kind for her .
After some hours in a shopping centre girls were very content .
When Anna came back home , she saw a huge bunch of red roses and behind it Mark was sitting .
She started to shout and cry , because she was very happy that her fiance came from abroad one week earlier than he planned .
That was the most lucky day from Anna'a life .
Going travelling , people may scheduled various destination and time .
According to the above reasons , car travelling will be the best choice .
Unlike public transportation , there is no limit in your way , no fixed timetable by car travelling .
You do n't have to wait until public transport arriving .
As good as your car is , you can go anywhere you want with your car , no matter which mountain , beach , or city is .
Car travelling makes people feel free during the journey .
There is no need to sit with strangers who may cause in an awkward situation .
Most of the time , pet is not allowed to be in a public transportation , which not a good thing for a pet owner .
Above all , car travelling is not only convenient but also free in your journey which leads public transportation into a fading future .
The conception of beauty has changed since people started thinking they need to be thin to become pretty .
Also , she admitted she would do anything to have a perfect body .
Today , Sandrine fainted up during a runway .
Doctors said she has become an anorexic .
Nowadays , It is painful that not too many people realize how degrading and dangerous this job could actually become .
I had never felt so nervous when about six months ago I decided finally to join the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) exam .
Because I had decided to take my exam in June , it was absolutely necessary to join an English preparation course as soon as possible .
If I would like to pass the exam , I had to improve my English skills .
I had been learning English for the last six months .
I had studied English at least two hours a day and longer .
Very soon I had recognized that the process of learning was not easy as I fought .
Moreover , I had many problems with the English grammar .
It was pretty sure that a lot of work had been waiting for me ahead .
But I am really lucky person . I had found a good teacher who supported me all the time . I also had some colleagues who had the same aims as mine .
We had been meeting for learning frequently .
We had organized some additional exercises , such as English movies night , a one day trip to London , and a book discussion about English writers and poets .
Because we did n't live in any English native country , we had tried as much as possible to create an English speaking environment .
Today it is a big day for me and my colleagues .
Finally , we take the FCE exam .
I want to be an expert in such areas as drilling , exploitation and development of oilfield , that is why I want to get a master degree abroad , or PhD at my university .
I think I have sufficient background , my GPA is good enough .
Beyond that throughout my university education , I have been a participant of scientific conferences and I took pains to practically assimilate everything I had learnt during my study .
For example , I have successfully completed « Offshore Drilling » course of « Total » Professors Association and I mean to broaden my outlook in the future .
As you know I just moved too a new town .
The town is not to big but still not to small .
Of course I miss you and all of my friends back in Sweden , but I will visit you guys soon !
Here are lots of tings to do , you can swim , go on a road trip , visit the zoo and go for a walk .
The main attraction here is absulotely the beach .
It 's a nice beach with white sand and blue wather .
I Love the beach , because I can swim , go tanning , and dive in to the ocean and ser all kind of fish .
I hope everything is great back in Sweden , see you soon !

I 've always laughed so much !
Subject : Opinion on what young poeple are interested
what young people are interested in today .
First of all , our generation youth people are more
open - minded and toreant in my opinion .
clothes wearing changes very quickly .
Now , young people like different kind of music , I think
pop and disco music is something all young people like .
Because this kind of music connects them on party .
It soothes them , calms them , aggravates them , excites them .
That is why music is very import thing about this festival .
Clothes theme is harder like I said before , because fashion
We all want to feel good what we wear , I recommend hipi style
clothes , not too hipi , but something comfortable .
Of course
it depends what season your doing the festival .
When autumn , winter
time then I suggest some other style , it has to be comfotable but
fashion enough .
Maybe colorful and cool blankets when someone gets
All in all , I think those tips help you and I hope you will
give those people one good international festival .
With reference to your recent ad about weekend cafe work , I am interested to apply .
I have been a full - time housewife for about ten years since my kids was born .
Cooking is part of my daily work , which is also one of my hobbies .
I enjoy cooking and interested in different kinds of food , especially Asian cuisine .
I had expenience in cooking food and reception for parties / functions as I was a member of the School Parent Association of my kid 's school .
As a member , during many occasions such as Christmas Party and School Open Day , I had opportunities to learn different kinds of food from other members as well as providing reception duties .
I really enjoyed answering parents ' enquires and introducing our school to them .
These are invalunable and relevant experience to the job I applied for .
Also , I am availalbe to work for long hours at weekends .
It would be grateful if I could be selected for interview .
To elaborate , their story are better as there are more twists and turns in plots .
Although the plots full of turns , they still very reasonable , and not make their audience felt that the plots are very strange .
Moreover , the special effect are better because foreign movies usually cost much more money than native to make .
For example , the first one 3 dimensional movie , Avatar , the movie maker spend a lot of energy and time on developing the novel movie genre .
It eventually made very good impression on its audience , and the most important for a commercial movie , it really did very well at the box office .
Watching foreign TV programs and movies , their viewers can learn not only foreign language but also exotic cultures .
Furthermore , foreign TV are more international and educational .
For instance , we can know many foreign news from watching CNN .
The news in CNN including events which are happening all over the world .
What 's more , the National Geographic and Discovery also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I ca n't learn from native programs .
They do not want to learn so much becuase they just watch movies for fun .
There is some truth in the claims that watching movies and TV programs is a relaxed activity .
However , I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture , or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain , they could get more reflection as recreating .
Plus , watching foreign programs also could attain the goal of those people-- relaxation .
Although movies in our own country are more popular than past , the foreign movies still play important role on domestic movie goer 's mind
With an intense passion in fashion , I aspire to become a professional product merchandiser in the apparel industry and initiate myown branding business with my older sister and her husband .
Both of whom have more than five years of experience in marketing planning and own a large number of fabric sources .
Therefore , I plan to maximize my previous experience with knowledge of psychology , skill of product development design to pursue graduate studies , and build up my ability in the Master of Fine Arts program in Fashion merchandising at Academy of Art University .
It is said that the main objective of telelevision is entrentein people and make their free time happier .
However , television should n't be used only for this purpose for different reasons .
For this reason , instead of entertaining , television should contain educative programmes .
They are used to manage different technologies as television or computer .
I think that children ca n't be supervised for their parents all the time because they have to work and make home tasks .
For this reason is important for them having a good educative programme on television .
I ' am not saying that television has to educate our children , but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things as numbers or letters .
Television is very important to give language skills to children .
When I was young I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things as geography or maths and it helped me a lot .
Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation issue to talk with friends .
I like very much to eat , when I can , in the pub near my house .
In this place " Stella d'oro " the owners prepare delicious rolls .
In particular every week you can find " Il panino più " , a special roll created by the fancy of the cook .
Of course I prefer to go to this pub with my family or with my friends , especially if I have to celebrate something , for example birthdays , anniversaries or something else .
I remember , when one of my daughters celebrated her eighteenth birthday , the pub 's owner put the number eighteen , made by cheese on the roll , with a little candle .
When I go there I also drink a good mixed beer : half light beer and half red beer with of a good flavor .
Of course with the roll we also order a lot of chips .
If we are all that we are still hungry we order cakes .
They have many different cakes : profiterol , meringata , tiramisù and so on .
Of course if the six of us go together is quite expensive , but if I go only with my husband I do n't spend so much .
I suggest everyone go to this place because not only is the food good but also the owners are very friendly .
The only problem is to find parking space because this pub is in a narrow road where it is not easy to find space to park the car .
But if you are lucky you can park .
But it can be also really relaxing and pleasant .
But also women think that shopping can be an unpleasant experience .
Particularly when we talk about everyday running from shop to shop to buy lettuce , meat or a tooth paste .
It can be really frustriting .
But when we think about going to the shopping centre with our friends it can be fun . We do n't even have to have money , because we can just go and do windowshopping .
And I do n't even want to think about the situation when we really need to buy something because of the coming pmor wedding .
It is a good for people who do n't want to leave their homes or they just do n't like the crowded shops .
Generally , shopping can be seen as enjoyable experience or just a usual need in order to survive .
A most famous person from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , who worsks in a department store and always planning how to make people life more comfortable and better .
He deserves to be famous because he has his own charity and helps to poor families with little children .
Sometimes I lisen to the radio and hear his comments about some global problems in my own country and some suggests about how to make our life better .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise .
I picked it up from the ground .
I talked about it with mum . "
Should I go if I do n't know , who send this to me ? "
She was surprisingly open to thought that I could try it at least .
It was n't common from her side .
I was sitting and waiting in a concert hall .
When it happened .
In the middle of a crowd was standing my mum with my dad , who had just returned from the war .
I were absolutely excited .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise ...
There was she , staying front me .
I thought I was dreaming first .
What the hell she was doing here !
How dare she could come to my door!There was no words to express my feelings ...
I'd been in my country for a while since I need to apply a visa for living in his country .
I could n't get in touch with him whatever I 'd done .
Every way I 'd tried was useless .
He 'd set walls between us .
After a while , I 'd seen a picture on his facebook page .
It was an angagement ring !
The congratulations words below the picture was explaining everything : He've got married to someone else !
What happened all those words he 'd given to me !
All the answer I could take was a huge silence ...
Just looked her with asking eyes .
" He 's died . " she said as if she was whispering .
" I 'd found this in his office . "
Then handed me a box and walked away .
Now , after all those long years have gone by with full of pain , disappointments , missing and regrets ; all I have was the memories which saved by him into a little wooden box .
I 've never got the reason made him leave me although all his love for me , unfortunately ...
People argue that today 's television is a load of rubbish , the quality of many programs is absolutely questionable and in many cases the language is vulgar .
Reasons why television has inherited this reputation are several .
First of all , the many repeats of all programs like serials or films do not motivate people to watch it .
Then , the large number of entertainment programs broadcasted discourage those who want more cultural or factual programs , as they have been drastically reduced .
It seems a result of the fact that , after a long day , people prefer to unwind in front of the television , watching " entertainment programs " rather then news or what 's up in the World .
Moreover , on television there are a lot of advertising constantly interrupting the broadcast , and of course this fact is very unpleasant .
There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before to condemn it .
For example , the wider choose of programs from all over the World , allow us to discover new cultures , new languages and new societies without travelling , and this enhance our knowledge .
In addition to that , the cost of the television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema , the theatre or Opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone .
Also , it is very important to remember that we have always the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when .
To sum - up , I think television is a very good value for money , the point is being able to choose what we want to watch .
Firstly , there are two kinds of famous people : those who want to have a private life and who do n't want everybody knowing each aspect of their lives and those who sell certain parts of their lives in magazines , journals or TV programmes or their entire private life .
Secondly , taking this into account , I think that everybody has the right of having a private life and the right of living without journalists following them to everywhere .
It 's true that their lives are too much exposed and they can not have a normal life .
Of course , they can control that by complaining in a trial .
Thirdly , in my opinion they have the right also of selling only the parts of their lives they want .
But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and it could arrive an embarrassing moment and if you have sold a kind of things like this before you ca n't say nothing .
To summarize , I believe that everybody deserve to have a private life .
When it does n't occur , they have to go to trials .
It is absolutely rewarding to receive good news from an old friend who has been absent of my life for so long time .
I would be completely happy to provide you with some accommodation while you stay in my country .
I am currently working at a place where I am getting a great wage so I have the possibility to accompany you on your journey .
We might go to the most representative places of Mexico such as : Templo mayor , Cancún , Acapulco , among many others .
In mexico , a foreign person do not face difficulties to be hired by a company . I would be pleased to help you with this part of your experience in my contry . I know that you are someone who loves animals ,
perhaps we can go to the city zoo in order to verify wheter there are any vacancies that fit with you .
Something I can do is to make some research about the places that need people who speak Englsih fluently .
As you know , in this country if you are someone who speaks more than 1 language , you have the chances to obtain a great job .
Please let me know if you need something extra while you are here .
I played wrestling at the College .
This was during my first year at the College .
This sport is performed in a group of twos .
It is performed one after the other according to their age groups .
Wrestling is new sport , which is unknown to many of my colleagues at the College .
It is played by both boys and girls .
Wrestling is performed during the night time when the moon light is on .
Wrestling is contested by two people while others wait for their turns respectively .
It starts with a drumming and singing by young girls of the community .
This were all the beautiful girl are shown to the young men of the community .
It is another method of admiring girls .
Wrestling is both interesting and entertaining sport .
Traditionally , we provide a firewood as a means of light at night for the sport .
It takes place in the middle of the village where there are enough space for the spectators .
Referee advise players about the rules of the game .
As such , referee explains the rules of the game through their captains i.e. Health and Safety .
Refreshments are on sale at a discounted price to visiting team .
This is a sport performed by young people only .
The rationale for the College are : to educate the student about our culture , ritual , values and out ways of life in the village .
First of all I lived in London for three weeks in 2012 .
I am a teacher in a High School and the authorities in my country let me stay there , improving my English .
I would like to say that learning any languages is complicated to someone , whatever you come from , but in my opinion there are many matter to discuss .
A good ilustration of this would be children .
One child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time , this child does n't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language , but they are listening to their parents speaking English their native language all the time and this let them learn without any difficulty .
On the other hand , if you go abroad you will be able to improve your English in anglophone country , in this case , your knowledge will be reinforced with your stay there .
To sum up , if you want to learn English you do n't need to go abroad , you can improve your English working hard inside your own country , for example , doing exercises like listening and writing or you can meet with native people who speak English to practise with them .
But if you have one opportunity to go abroad , this would be so good for you and your English .
After my graduation , I was employed by AECOM Asia Ltd Co. as a graduate engineer since September 2013 .
I was assigned to work on project of the CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd under agreement of Term Geotechnical Consultancies .
I assisted the project engineer in Engineer Inspection for Maintenance .
The maintenance responsibility of those slopes belongs to the CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd.
The course is mainly on workplace safety within power station .
my name is Eleonora Palerma , I am 17 years old and I live in a city in northern Italy called Seregno .
Apart from studying at the high school " Marie Curie " of Meda , I sing in a choir as a soprano and my director would be pleased to speak for me if you would like to contact him to get further information .
I think I would be a suitable candidate for the job because I am used to looking after my neighbours ' children and I have recently attended a course about first aid so I would be ready to medicate children in case they get injured .
In addition to my native language I can speak German as well as English in fact I am attending a first certificate course now and last year I spent 2 months in Berlin , my german teacher would be happy to receive your call to tell you more about my language experiences .
If it is necessary I would be willing to come for an interview at any time .
they are more than willing to reply to your requests .
It still has to have the same elements like : roof , walls , floor , ceiling , basement , loft , door or windows .
Construction will be ameliorated .
However a sweeping appearance wo n't be different .
Although , I think , that all the systems , which work in homes ( electricity , gas , heating system , water , etc . ) will be upgraded .
New technologies are going to seize architecture .
Though , it will affect on the environment in a good way .
I think , that the home of the future will be huge , but single - storey .
For one thing - convenience .
Except that , every room will be full of interactive gadgets .
Owing to that people wo n't need to meet and talk .

THE MOST INTERESTING WEEKEND ON MY LIFE
I had always believed that the best memories of life were when you meet new people , new places , going out with your friends , taking sun on the beach , thingS like this .
Are beautiful moments , but now I reckon that there is n't nothing more interesting than having all your family together talking about whole background .
Surprising stories that we will not never imagine .
My family are n't so close and is distributed in many cities on my country , after some incidents in the past , many things changed and each family followed their own way .
However , my siblings and I decided to set up a big surprise to my father for his birthday number 50 .
We tried to contat the most amount famiy as we could .
It was a perfect weekend because there was a holiday on Monday .
We rented a wonderful place outside our city , spectacular atmosphere .
It was the most interesting and astonishing weekend that I have lived eve .
Firstly , to see father 's face when he saw all people .
A long time I haven't seen my father so happy . secondly , seeing how big is the family now , many children .
Everything was amazing , a lot of memories , we laughed a lot , we did many activities like bbq , table games , watched movies , swimming pool , among others .
Now I believe that the best moments in the life are when you have time with your family , is the best way to recharge energy for everything .
Many times we pay more attention to other things , it can do it in many opportunities .
Family is one , and we do n't know when can lose them .
In my opinion travelling by car is more comfortable than travelling by public transport because you can choose where do you want to go and the time you prefer to start your trip .
Travelling around the city by car was faster than public transport .
And when you want to move around your city , if you go by car , most of the time you ca n't park your car because there are very few car parks in the cities .
Sometimes public transport is interesting because you can use it when you want to go to a party and you probably drink some wine , beer , etc .
If you would like to go fast to somewhere , do n't use public transport because it is very slow .
The problem to use our car instead of public transport is the pollution .
If everyone use public transport climate change does not increase more .
I 've seen your letter and I 'm writing this to you to say what I do in my country to help saving the environment .
At my school I do n't do that much because we are just five people that are worried about the world .
We tried to convince the Headmaster to help us monetarily but it was n't enough .
At home I convinced my family to recycle and reuse the water that we ca n't drink , to give to our plants .
Now what do you do at your school and at your home ?
Tell me I 'm curious .
The aim of this report is to outline what are the best places to have fun in Valencia for young people , what facilities exist for them and how these could be made better .
My city , Valencia , is a touristic city situaded by the sea .
Also , it would be a good idea go to the beach to spend the day and play volleyball or sunbathing , because this it is always a good plan .
Valencia , has different areas to go out in the evening , but some of them required the passport , so if you are younger than 18 it would be difficult to enter .
Moreover , you can go to eat " Paella " and ride around the " Albufera " of Valencia in a small boat .
However , the art and science museum , it could be the funniest plan .
In addition i suggested going by bus around the surroundings of the city , where you can do adventure sports , like canoening , climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoy the countryside
I recommend that they should do both activities , Valencia city and also de the surroundings .
Maybe I could check if I can bring you some free tickets for the public transport .
We are always go to the cinema to watch a new one .
My favourite kinds of movie is comedy and drama comedy because it has interesting plot and person , who watches comedy can lought all the time .
While person is watching this kind of movie he / she is just relaxing and has a good time .
Now I will further developed our last statement .
As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) said lottery play is not economically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe , but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibilty from scaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
Cohen 's knwoledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Some people like to calculated the gain or lose from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dolar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams .
People do n't invest the money they spend on lottery .
Though this has been an amusing debate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that lottery should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a tradition , it gives help , hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment .
First of all you should find the entrance of the airport .
Then you should know that you there will be two kinds of transport .
Taxy is the first variant .
Also you can use the bus .
It might be more boring way to my home but I like it for the price .
When you hear the bus stop Ploshad Truda you should leave the bus and I 'll meet you at this bus stop .
In my opinion the weather is better today than yesterday .
So it would be very well if you take a warm coat and an umbrella .
The swimming pool in Brunete has customers from all age groups , but it is especially suitable both for young and elderly people in order to improve their mobility .
The building has two changing rooms for men and women .
Several bathrooms are available with cold and hot water in them and a 25 metre - length heated pool .
As far as I am concerned there are some pros and cons about the use of the swimming pool .
On the one hand everything is very cleaned including floor , bath and corridors , in addition , if you are a disabled person you will not have any trouble to get there because there are some ramps to help you come in .
On the other hand you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .
In my opinion the swimming pool is convenient because you can walk to swim if you live in town but is very expensive , particularly for young people .
I suggest that prices should be lower than they actually are .
Famous people have been always sorrunded by a lot of journalists and paparazzies who follow them wherever they go .
Those people could be politicians , film starts , singers , football players and so on living in a constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and because of this they have to keep calm and carry with it .
Therefore , most of this famous people complain of this but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constanlty devoting every minute of the day to them because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing with whom they are , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people though they have to accept some critics because not everybody has to love them .
I do agree with a statement that shopping is not always enjoyable .
It has many disadvantages .
It 's a large space with a lot of shops , so we need much time to visit all of them .
After a few hours we are so tired , that we do not have power to do anything else .
Besides , in the shopping centres there 's a loud energetic music played all the time and a crowd of people , so we get home with a huge headache .
Money is another reason why we do not always enjoy the shopping .
We live in a time of acquisitiveness and people buy many things , even if they ca n't afford it .
Times in which we live are conducive to addictions .
People addicted to shopping in the long run do not enjoy this ritual anymore - they do it just because they have to , although they have no money and no space at home for all those things they buy .
Sometimes better is to visit some small shops than big centres .
Today in big cities public transport is necessary for tourists , students , kids and workers ; but the situation is very different in small cities .
In Italy there are few cities with the hunderground and often in the smaller cities there are only bus .
A good public transport is the sign of a civilized city . in this way there are fewer cars so less traffic .
I hope for the next generations a better public service and an increasement of its use .
thanks to this new life stryle our cities will be more liveable .
At 6:20 I open my laptop , go to page : Youtube.com and start to study French with Mrs .
I write down new French vocabularies or grammars into my notebook .
Around 7:15am , I take a shower and get dressed , I usually wear jeans and T - shirts .
I pack my backpack , take my garbage bag and look around my room for one last time to make sure : I do n't forget anything . I go downstairs and put the garbage bag into the trash bin .
I go to the garage to take my motorbike .
It takes me about 30 minutes to drive to my company , It depends if the traffic 's good .
As usual , I buy a coffee and breakfast on the way , I can have bread or sweet potato for my daily breakfast .
I have many choices for lunch but I prefer Hu Tieu or Pho .
I go to my art class at 6:20pm to 9 pm on Tuesday and Thursday evening .
The other evening , I stay at home and read books , or do some English exercises to improve my English skills .
On the weekend , I wake up at 6:15am but I get up at 7 am . I still study French with Mrs Alexa as usual . Saturday afternoon I hang out with my boyfriend , we go to the cinema or the coffee shop .
Sometimes , we meet our mutual friend and have dinner with them .
Now , that I 'm on holidays , I watch more tv , especially some series like : Criminal Investigation or The Mentalist .
To relax , I used to read , listen to music , go to the cinema , hang out with friends , go shopping , ride a bike or swim .
What do you do to relax , beside watching TV ?
The reasons for Greece 's terrible economic situation are that Greece has surrender its currency sovereignty to the European Central Bank , by which Greece could not apply monetary policy to spur its economy , and the Greek government is very corrupted so that Greeks could easily dodge taxes .
Monetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy , and , from the empirical experience , many countries have successful applied such policy .
In 2012 , Japanese central bank unprecedented depreciated Yuan , which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation .
Obviously , Taiwan has its own currency , new Taiwan dollar , and if Taiwan 's economy is worsening someday , Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government did in 2012 .
Not only Taiwan is different from Greece in currency sovereignty , it also wins in government 's efficiency .
According to a global survey , Taiwan wins reputation in effectiveness , in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Therefore , Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes .
Without a doubt , the efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to people 's welfare .
Therefore , Taiwan would not be sunk down like Greece .
As a country , Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create lovely and healthy environment to its civilians .
Once upon a time a mason called Nick that had a family of four , two sons and his wife but they had conflicts with the studies of their children , the money he earned was not enough to maintain the whole family they were in poverty .
His kids dreamed with a big house that has a pool , a third floor , Jacuzzi and a beautiful landscape to the beach , also they wanted to have a dog , if they had one it would be called Winy .
They told every dream to their dad , and they know he would enforce it even though under the circumstances it seemed to be impossible he would try .
Next week a cousin that he did not know , he was a very reach man and when he knew about their problem he decided to help so he gave them an incentive .
He said that if Nick makes a house of two floors he would buy it and pay the studies of the children lifelong , which gave a reverse to the impossible
Nick started making the planes for the house , from that moment he trended to get to his house and at the moment drag the planes and continue working when he finished the planes after months of working on them he started to bring it to life , the house would be made of wood because he could not pay for more .
After months of working in the house he finished , and his cousin gave him a bonus reward of one million dollars to start with , buying a big house with everything they want .
When they got eighteen they could get a good job because of their good studies .
They could give a good life to their families and have a dog also called Winy , and all this thanks to the rich man that nobody knew .
The pie chart shows the principal causes which justify why agricultural lands became less productive , whereas the table correlates these causes with three different regions of the world which had land degraded , namely North America , Europe and Oceania , during the 1990s .
Overall , it is clear that the main causes for land degredation were deforestation and over - grazing .
These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degreaded .
A closer look at the pie chart reveals that over - grazing was the most important reason why land was so degraded , with the highest percentage of 35% .
This was followed by the deforestation , with 30% , while over - cultivation had 28% .
Finally , 7% could be explained for other reasons .
It may be justified by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity .
In the first case , Europe reprented the highest percentage of land degraded caused by deforestation and over - cultivation , 9.8% and 7.7% respectively .
This was a great impact on total land degraded as Europe was more affected , with a total of 23% .
By another side , Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% bacause of over - grazing , which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded .
By contrast , in general North America had the lowest rates in deforestation and over - grazing , with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively .
for this resaon , this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded , with only 5% .
If you travel to Guangzhou , you ca n't miss this series because this is a symbol of Guangzhou .
Canton Tower is located at an intersection of Guangzhou New city Central Axes and Pearl River .
It is the highest tower in China and the third highest tower in the world .
The height of the tower is 600 metres , with 450 metres main body and 150 metres of its antenna .
The tower has a special name called ' slim waist ' because the shape of it is twisting .
We can see different picture of the tower from different angles .
This is not only a sightseeing building , but also has a lot of recessional facilities .
For example , the tower has 4D cinema , the highest revolving restaurant and so on .
Cantonese always spend their holiday with their child here .
Firstly , I must say that I do n't consider that my family members are my best friends , not only because they have other problems to care about but also because I do n't know how to tell them my problems .
However , we consider a friend that person you can have fun with , laugh and meet . I 'm use to do that with my parents and my brothers but it 's not the same as when I meet my best friends .
Moreover , I think that I should n't ask them to have what we call a " therapy moment " as I do with my best friends when I 'm worried for something or someone , in fact I would n't know how to start telling them about that .
Some teenagers have the luck to be open - minded and they know how to speak with their parents and it 's a good way to solve problems .
In my opinion I think that I should have more confidence with my family and remember that they wo n't leave me for something I had done in other way my best friends can do .
In my town , there is no future for public transport , because the time necessary to get to the city centre is the same walking or by bus .
Travel by bus is expensive , bored and annoying .
The route makes many stops , in different places , so the way in the map is a mess .
This is like that all days , except Sunday .
On Sunday , the bus do n't work until 3 p.m.
From this hour , there is only one service every hour , until 10 p.m. Anyone of these 7 bus takes less a half hour to get to the city centre , in spite of Sunday has not traffic jam .
Buses are slow and noisy , and when you can get off of them , you are tired and angry , and probably you are not on time .
Is much more convenient you walk to the city centre .
At the same time , you can get fit walking approximately 30 or 40 minutes , and you will not have the problem for park your car .
You will expend the same time travelling by bus or walking , but the difference is to get angry or not .
Transportation is a means of movement of one geographical location to another by any means of transport .
We know in the olden days how our forefathers suffered in their movement .
If a person wants to trevel from Kano to Lagos he has no choice but to track .
Therefore , is not easy back there for anybody to use other means because there was non .
At present there are many means of transportation .
The technology brought about lots of development in transportation .
We can travel by air using the aircraft , aeroplane , helcopter and rest .
Unlike before we have big ships to use on the sea .
I believed that technology really improve our ways and means of our transport .
So whoever want to star a journey has several choice of transport , eaither by sea , by air , by land or by foot .
I can not forget to talk about cars , lorry and vehicles .
Thanks
Swimming is my favourite sport in the world , I started it when I was five years old , I really enjoy it , I feel that the water is my place in the word , I feel free .
Although I took part in many competitions , there are one which was the most enjoyable experience in my life .
I have to swimming in the Parana 's river with all the swimmers and coaches .
First , when I was in the starting line I felt could not finish the competition , then when we were in the water the coaches did not stop to encourage so was easy to swim to the finishing line . I was so exciting to see our family waiting for us clapping and shouting loudly every time one of us arrived .
If you are interested in taking part in this sport , I would suggested to buy all the equipment you will need : a comfortable swimsuit , goggles and a huge bag to keep them .
' The moment of realisation hits you like tons of bricks , leaving you in a life full of regret and guilt '
His whole life , he only wished for one thing and that was to be popular .
People got attracted towards her quite easily and often , they would find themselves adoring and admiring her .
Pain of jealousy .
That girl who had left him in need of time .
That girl who had done nothing but harm for him .
An innocent dare made by Sara which led Michael to walk in a path of wrong .
courage can change lives
They had n't isolated him , rather he had .
They had n't abandoned him neither had they distanced themselves from him .
She had always wanted to be with him but he had closed the door for her .
He had been blind by rage .
His delusions had drifted him away from her .
He had done such a huge mistake .
No tears or sorrys would make a less culprit .
Right now , he has the one thing he always wished for - popularity , but only now does he realise , that it was meaningless , point less .
Each and every colour glow in the dark giving hope out of the darkness .
One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children , babies .
Mostly during 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , when people go and finish work , that is when we get the most awful traffic jams , sometimes it takes an hour to get form point A to B in town which is a terribly long time not to mention parents who have to take their children to school , nursery and then get to work , too .
On the other hand the bypass might cause a drastic drop in tourism in the town .
All in all , I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than advantage , because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it 's less important .
Because I did n't find any ticket for the concert in London I bought one for the concert in Birmingham .
I 've booked the ticket nearly one month before the event .
The day before I started to freak out thinking that I was meeting them .
Else the ticket for the concert I bought the VIP ticket as well , so I had to go before to Birmingham , because the entrance to the venue was at 17:00 and as I live close to London , I had to leave at about 12:00 so I did n't have to rush .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , and then , as I 've never been to Birmingham I had to look for the 02 Academy , where the event took place .
When I arrived there , I queued for the VIP queue .
At 17:00 they let us in the venue and they made all the checkings .
After 30 minutes started the acoustic performance which lasted for about 15 minutes , afterwards we took pictures .
When everybody took their photos , Emblem3 got backstage to get ready for the concert and after one hour it sterted .
I left the arena at midnight and I went to an hotel that I did already book online .
On the day after I went back home .
Dear Sir Madam ,
My name is Maria and I saw your advertisement and I am interested in the job .
On the one hand , I am studying to be a PE teacher so I know how to organise activities for young people such as fishing or doing a sport .
I'm good at entertaining parties What is more , I really enjoy working with them since they are very active and willing to do any kind of activities .
You also mentioned that I would need to work in the kitchens helping .
I could also add that I know how to cook for lots of people .
On top of that , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that you will save time because both buses and cars wo n't be able to move in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives you more freedom and flexibility to make your own schedule while public transport limits you to a timetable that not always meet your needs .
After cars prevailed among the public , our governments have tried to pave rough roads , which promotes people to use cars even more .
Nowadays , it might be argued if the current transportation system would be working in the future like present , while there is a still big room for public transportation remaining as a significant method .
This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be around us or if it will disappear completely .
For a start , the convenience for us to travel around would probably be one of the main arguments .
In some countries , the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient , which forces people to use private cars .
However , it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also for their parents it is definitely more reliable .
If a car which emits no serious global warming gas would be developed , there would be no argument that people had better reduce our use of cars , yet , as long as we are manufacturing them we could not find more eco - friendly and efficient ways than public transportation .
In conclusion , it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future even though travelling with cars is more convenient than travelling with just trains or buses .
But in the same way as cars development , our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco - friendly .
All of the world is constantly changing - develop a new technologies , people invented new think .
To make life easier . People always want to make better their life .
I think that the home of the future will be different than now , but the main function of the home wo n't change , because for ages home have been a place where people can feel safely .
Everybody think that home is refuge .
In my opinion home in the future will be similar to present houses .
There always will be the kitchen , because we must eat , always will be the bathroom - you know why .
And in the home always will be a room to sleep and relax .
Home in the future may be more modern and safety .
Everywhere will be cameras and motion sensors .
Kitchen will be better eguipped , may be with smart appliances and people , who ca n't cook , will prepare the meal by yourself .
May be in the future homes will be self - cleaned and we need not clean up .
I think that the differences between home now and home in the future will be small .
Personally houses in the future will not be cosy , but very sterile . I do not like it .
Home should associate with family , happiness .
Traffic accidents , the main problem of car travelling , will be solved by self - driving technology .
Having a car takes much money .
Using public transport is cheaper than having a car , especially living in urban area .
If one wants to go somewhere , one can use a shared car which is parked at designated area .
By this method , people have to pay small fee for use a car , not much money such as having a car .
If car - sharing and self - driving technology are mixed , it will be much more convenient than both the conventional public transport and travelling my car .
People do n't have to possess their car paying much money .
It will be a new public transport .
All my life I practiced sports , but definitely my favorite sport is squash .
I started to training when I was ten years old .
I had never played a raquet 's sport before , so I was very excited to hit the small black ball with my racket .
The first year I went to a tournament in Torreon and I win the first place , during the first 3 years I was ranking in the first 10 places of Mexico , but then I had to reduce my practices because I had a problem with my knees .
Play squash is an awesome activity and is easy to learn , I love that this game is very fast and you do a lot of exercise .
The bad news is that in Mexico is not very common , so it 's a little bit difficult to find a field and is expensive , more or less the price per hour is $ 150 pesos .
For someone new in this sport I would recommended be patient and constant in the training , because the practice is what make you better and helps to improve your level , and finally always enjoy the game .
Always been free .
The longest was at the primary school , lasted 2 days , because her mother could cook the finest biscuits ever tasted .
Now he was 35 and he was still keeping on smile at the news of his colleagues and friends marriages .
He was so cynical to turn out to be very nasty and unpopolar .
Love last two and a half a year , he kep to remind himself .
Soon or later mariied people will get divorced .
Since one day he met a girl , on the train , she was n't that beauty but she had , you know , that smile , so peaceful , so harmonic .
They started talking blaming for the train late and after two hours they were still chatting .
They laughed so much that they both forgot to get out at the right stop .
The poor two had gone too far and now they had to come back .
Finally he arrived .
He said hello to the girl smiling .
Nowadays everybody has one or more cars , as a consequence of that , some people believe that public transport is going to disappear .
There are several reasons to believe that ; firstly , many people are influenced by the advertising which mixes happiness with driving cars and makes people think that public transport is not as a smart option as cars .
In second place , it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground .
On the other hand , there are a number of reasons against the end of the public transport .
For example , you must take public transport instead the car because it produces less pollution .
In addition , public transport is cheap because to buy a car meaning spend a fortune and in big cities , where are concerned about the environment such as Amsterdam or Tokio , there are many facilities as mobile phone applications or special offers .
To sum up , no one knows the future ; however , I believe that travelling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more because it is good to save up money and to reduce contamination .
In my opinion less people are travelling by public transport and started to buy their own cars which is more comfortable to use whenever you are in a hurry or not .
In the first place you feel more comfortable in your own car than in a bus for example . You do n't need fear that someone could suddenly stole your purse or you do n't have to listen to the others when you travel by your car .
Studies have shown that your self esteem and feelings of protection increase when you are a car driver .
You do n't have to indulge staying in a crowded place with people you do n't know .
Saving some money and buy a car is the best thing you can do .
In the second place not all public transports are in their best shape .
Some of them are dirty and smell .
If you have your own car these things do n't bother you anymore cause you wash your car anytime you want .
In conclusion travelling by car is far better than using public transport

I 've graduated in 2010 majoring in accounting with a degree having an accumulated GPA of 2.49 out of 5 , since I came here I have been so ambitious that I will be getting my high studies as soon as I finish studying English , it turned out that I have to jump through the loop in order to over come these obstacles which I believe it is an ordinary requirements to get a master 's degree for the foreign students .
In addition , there is recent statistic that shows a very high percentage of Saudi Arabia students who came to America to do set their master 's degree that they could n't get in university due to some requirements for instance , GRE , G MAT , or even their GPA did n't meet the university conditions .
In fact , I do n't want to be one of those student who could n't accomplish their dream and go back to their home , I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to get into your university .

Besides , I 'm an eager , mature student willing to study master 's degree at your university and I 'm looking forward to getting response back and your recommendations .
sincerely ,
I am forty nine years old and I am a quite crazy , so I make a lot of mistakes .
In this writing I will comment about one of the last mistake that I have made and its consequent .
First , I want to focus your attention on the fact that normally the mistakes have not importance , because all the things have fix and , if they have not fix why do you worry ?
In the last trip , I parked my car on the airport park , it has many plants with several sign .
Every plant has a color sign , red , orange , green , blue and an intermediate color between the red and the orange and this was my confusion .
I left my car in the plant with the orange color , but when some day later I looked for my car I made it in the plant of the intermediate color .
I knew that my car was on the site number one hundred and thirty five , buy the car was not there .
I spend quite time thinking and when I decided go to the police I passed in front of the orange sign and finally I found my car .
I 'm nervous to see you .
The weather here is sunny so I recommend you to bring summer clothes It is sad that you only come for one week but we will enjoy a lot .
From the airport to my house there are just 5 minutes .
When you came out to the road you need to go straight until you reach a restaurant , then you must go to the left where you would find a big square with swings and slides .
Finally you would see a big red house with lots of windows .
You will no regret coming to Spain .
First of all , studying online does not allow students to ask teachers about questions .
What is more , this kind of students are between eighteen and twenty two , when they need to socialise and interact with other students to enjoy their free time .
Something impossible if they study online , which means that their only classmate is the computer or the laptop they use .
However , this method of studying is cheaper than the common way , and it also can be completely free which is a big advantage .
Moreover , it allows you to study with your own rhythm without thinking about the rest .
For these reasons , I prefer the common way than studying online .
Nowadays people want to travel by their own conveyance by their own car , bike , scooter or something like that .
Everyone wants to have a stress less / happy journey whether it is for a long route or not .
It is really realistic too , because we all want to save our time and wishes for a happy journey time .
Now let me tell you the scenario of public transport .
First of all we always need to wait for it and it will run according to the scheduled time only .
In winter it is fine we can adjust in crowd but if we talk about summer session we can not adjust when we are travelling in a suffocated environment .
We need to book tickets in advance , in case we are planning to go via public transport because again the issue of availability of seats are there .
I live in Trieste , a very beautiful city , but this city has a great problem : it has a lot of cars , more than inhabitants .
Of course it 's an exaggeration , but I say this to confirm that in this city the number of the cars is very high .
By the way , the public transport is not so convenient , because at a certain hours you can not find bus .
In our city the buses stop at midnight .
Also the ticket price is not cheap .
Another problem of the buses is that if you take one during certain hours , it 's impossible to find a place free to sit down .
So travelling by bus is not convenient , not only for time but also for the problems that you can find .
The other question is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia , where , the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy , so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fuel the car directly in Slovenia , where they can find much more competitive prices .
He wants to convince me to use alternative means of transport , but after I see the price of this ecological vehicle I considered that I 'll buy one of them only if the price becomes
loverer .
Currently , people think about if they can get good english in my country or have to move to english speaking country .
And after that , it depends on the personality , status ( single , engaged or married ) , and even the ages of people , they will decide to learn in their own country or go abroad for getting english .
On the hand , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especially for young people .
They usually go abroad because they have not so much responsibilities just it prepares their professional future .
But They can only afford it to work as a au pair , waiter , kitchen porter or porter that include accommodation , normal wages and you do n't need high level of english .
Of course , you leave a lot of things , such as your family , friends , foods , places , own things , etc . , and nobody put up with being very far away from all these things .
Moreover , people about mid 's 30 years old , they do not usually leave their country and try to get new language from are living .
This way is cheap as well and they have not to change everything around their life to achieve this aim .
In addition , with this ages , normally people have more charges , maybe children , mortgage , partner , etc .
From my opinion , the best way for learning really good a language it is living in the same country where people speak it .
So , you do n't hesitate and move to the new country , in which you do not only get language , even different culture and lifestyle .

The purpose of this report is to explain the that my town has become more aware in the need of taking care of the countryside .
Since 2010 my town has tried to include some changes to boost the town .
In the last five years many new bins have been situated near all neighbourhoods .
There are four type of rubbish skip .
On one of these bins are destined to plastics , another one is for wood and paper , the third one is a bottlebank and the last one is for cells .
Apart from that , there are other container focused on every type of objects .
Because of that 5 new parks has been created recently .
Those are a great place where families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside .
Moreover residents have become more conscious after they have read the leaflets which explain the importance of respect the environment .
I strongly think that it is necessary to make people conscious about the importance of save the planet .
In addition , more people would help if they can recycle easily .
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I would like applying for this vacancy because I think I have most of requirements that you are asking for .
First of all , cooking is my passion for ages .

I would be glad if I could get an interview for giving you more details about my work experience , skills or what you need to ask me .

Nowadays people 's life is having an unexpected change all because globalitation .
In the past people has to manage their time so they could go to their work , take care of their children and maybe also study .
Globalitation starts in the 20 's , so a huge amount of population has experience this change , in my opinion is kind of good .
Now people can interact with other people from other countries by texting , facebook or whatsapp .
The need of export and import items has increased in the last 10 years consequently the life of the people has raised in faster respond .
Everyone needs an instant answer to what they asking for , if they send an email you must received it in less than 1 minute .
The personal contact shows a decrease in this time because people do n't want to face their real problems , instead they can see all the poblems happened in the world by their smartphones .
In the future people will comunute between them by their computers , cellphones , tablets and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Nowadays , we already have things like smart phones , which can nearly do everything we want to .
And we have some other media gadgets .
In my opinion it wo n't .
I 'm of the opinion that people 's lives wo n't change extremely in the next 50 years .
Of course there will exist some more electronical things like some new handys , with functions we could expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
But if we speak of the change of people 's lives there have to be some more dramatically things .
A point would be , that normal people are able to fly to the moon or something , or if there would be people living on the mars .
But I think that this wo n't be able to do .
Even not in 50 years .
To put it in a nutshell we could say that our global world will be more electronical , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo nt change our lives dramatically .
Hi brother ,
I 've been thinking about what you said to me the previous week .
It 's true that we do n't pay attention to our grandma 's .
She loves us and she always looks after us when dad and mum could n't do it .
I believe that we haven't never thanked her what she did and do for us .
For that I 've had the idea of giving her a present .
You 're agree with me , are n't you ?
Yesterday I saw a nice present for her in the new mall of Jerez , called AreaSur .
It seemed not to be very expensive and was luxury and lovely .
If you do n't think the same as me you can choose another present , I wo n't have any problem .
Anyway , we should go to the mall together and there we will take the final decision .
You only have to walk through the road in front of home and you will arrive bus station .
Then take the third line and two stops later you will arrive mall .
I hope to see you soon brother .
Send me an email when you 're able to go shopping
In my opinion any transport is completely safe , however people say the plane is the safest transport .
And , maybe the car is the most comfortable .
It is true that both are advantages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , dangerous and relaxing , I knew this is a contradiction , but I can explain it .
When you make a long trip you can go without pressure .
If you are tired you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax yourself , and if in the car there are more passengers you can change with them , so you will feel less tired .
Even travel by car , in my opinion , has a lot of problems .
Some advantages could be :
- There are n't enough car parks and they are very expensive , for example when you travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking .
This situation only is present in Caceres when there is a rainy day , but in other cities like Madrid , Barcelona … is a daily situation .
I think , driving can be dangerous because people must respect speed limits , and not every time that it is .
People does n't wear the seatbelt , use phones , and even there are who drink when they are going to drive .
All these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persons are in danger .
Every holiday , the DGT , in Spain , make an awareness campaign to remember us the good manners when we are driving .
On the other hand , travelling by plane people say is safer then do it in others transport .
I do n't make sure this affirmation .
I hate the moment when the plane is taking off , and when it is touching off .
I 'm afraid so that started when I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon .
In this moment there was a tropical storm , and the turbulences are horrible ; but a not time I have stopped to travel by plane .
I knew is the better option when you want to travel abroad .
It is true , that plane is very expensive , at least I never haven't be able to book a cheap ticket .
I look for the perfect offer but in summer it is impossible to find it .
To sun up , all kind of transport have positive and negative aspects , but depending of our necessity we use one or another .
For example there are a lot of countries where bike is the most main of transport , like Belgium .
I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle line , on the contrary than here in Spain , where few cities like Madrid or Barcelona , strengthen their use .
I do not agree with the situation .
This is simple because not everyone has a personal vehicle .
In addition , because of the gap between the upper class to the lower class people .
Next year in Turkey .
we can see the number of the projected sales of jeans of Jack&Jones Co . will be at 450 thousands of pairs in next Jan , it will be higher than the number of the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. about 300 thousands of pairs .Then the number of Jack&Jones Co . will drop to 250 thousands of pairs in Feb next year .
after this fall , the number of Jack&Jones Co. will rise up gradually until to hit the peak at 90 thousands of pairs in Dec.
The projected sales of khan 's of Mango Co. Next year will begin at 150 thousands of pairs then it will go down a little bit in Feb .
The number of Mango Co. will grow up steadily from May to July next year , it will stay remain at 500 thousands of pairs for four months then get the highest number about 600 thousands of pairs in this period .
The pie chart share illustrates the projected market share of Mango Co.,Jack&Jones Co.and others companies in jeans at the end of next year . Jack&Jones Co.will get 30% of the projected market share in jeans , Mango Co. take 20% of it .
However , others companies will dominte the half of the projected market share in jeans next year .
Very different morning
When I opened the door imagine my surprise there was a small present left on the ground .
Besides I was not sure whether I should take it up .
As it was quite early in the morning there was just silence everywhere .
But before opening it I decided to make a cup of green tea to calm down a bit as I felt nervous enough .
While the water was boiling a lot of different thoughts came into my head : " I do n't have any birthday today and there are few more months until Christmas ... What could be the reason for such a nice present wrapped in a pink paper ?
Maybe someone wishes to make some little surprise for me , does n't he ? " " Ok , lets open it !
Oh , if you knew - that present made my day !
When I opened it I found there my favourite chocolate with very cute ' Thank you ' letter .
I got it from my neighbour and he just was so thankful for my help tidying up his garden week before .
Although many people believe that our lives are getting better than they where 20 years ago , scientist proved that if we carry on with our ways of living using , for instance modern technology , we will lose control of our lives .
Technology has reached such a point where we need to do anything in order to achieve something .
People where given the task to write a piece of writing of their choice using the resources already provided by the institution in charge .
Firstly , they were given 5 books of different subjects .
This time the study showed that all of the applicants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes .
Thus , this study concluded that in around 50 years from now , people will have worked , fed , showered and even lived without leaving there homes .
If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences , we should start to realise how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it .
As a matter of fact I have been camping since I was 6 years old , for this reason I started working on summer camps when I was 18 years old .
I am a suitable person for the job because I used to work with children of all ages , but I prefer to play with kids between 8 and 12 years old , also I am always trying to improve different activities therefore avoid getting bored , and I do not mind working in other areas of the camp .
To sum up I would like to participate with you , and I can promise you will not regret it , I hope to hear from you soon .
I promise you will not regret to come , everything here is wonderful and there are many places we can go to visit .
Is easy to get to my apartment from the airport , you can take a taxi and tell the driver to take you to the powder street , when you get there you just call me and I get there , my apartment is not far from that street .
Is cheaper to travel by bus but it is not very safe , you need to take a taxi , is a bit more expensive but is much safer .
The weather is changing , in the morning there is high winds , at the afternoon it is sunny , and in the night it is very cold .
I 'll wait here , and I really want to see .
And of course , unknown actors call for some pieces of attention .
In my opinion they are also people as we are . They have their own life ,
that is why I do n't understand why is it so important for people to know what happenes with celebrity ?
I think it is not so joyfully , when you wake up and see camera 's flash !
Also when you spend time with your boyfriend or girlfriend , you know that someone is taking a photo of you .
In my opinion , each person , without reference is it celebrity or not , deserves his own private life .
The aim of this report is to inform about the ways in which my village carries out measures to look after the environment .
For this , we will analyse several aspects such as what local residents do with the rubbish and how Lanjarón tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people .
Nowadays there is more and more rubbish because of the high amount of package used to wrap products and increase in consumption .
In Lanjarón as in the rest of the villages and towns people are getting used to buying and consuming much more than they used to do in the past .
However , in recent years my village has been promoting ways for people to get ride of the rubbish in a conscious way .
A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to join several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling .
Lanjarón is one of the most tourist villages in the region La Alpujarra ; therefore , it is very important both for the council and the local residents to keep the village clean .
To get this the council sets different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in .
For instance , monthly it is held a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village .
At the end of the competition those whose area is cleaner and attractive receive an award .
If we all were aware of this and did something to help it in our daily routines , the planet would thank us for this .
There are two opposite opinions about military service .
On one , hand military service must be mandatory .
Others consider that it is military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary .
First of all , there is no absolutely safety in the modern world .
There are different dangers of a military nature such as terrorist attacks , wars and other armed conflicts .
Therefore , compulsory service at in the army gives special military knowledge , which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict .
Secondly , the mandatory military service can develop the character of a person , making it stronger .
More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develops organizational skills and practice discipline .
Moreover , it can educate young people be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents .
For example , it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service , because during the one or two years of service , soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military .
Also , the time spent serving in the army can uproot or separate families or friends ' relations .
Besides , there are emergencies , which can happen with guns or weapons such as explosions and accidents .
Furthermore , there are hazing acts at in the army .
These acts often turn out to be tragic having a long post traumatic effect on the young person or even loss of life .
Army years often have an impact on the whole family , especially in case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to the warzone .
Finally , there is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages , but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world .
This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for it .
Firstly , the food I make by myself is more trustful than the food that is made in restaurants .
Because I do n't know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant put .
Also the food I make by myself is much healthier .
Because all of the restaurants want to earn money , so they will just use cheap and not healthy ingredients to cook the food .
But if I make my own food , of course I wo n't use any kind of unhealthy ingredients .
So the food I made by my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants .
And also homemade food has better quality than low price restaurants .
Some people think cooking themselves is too annoying or tired so they go out to eat .
But actually if you cook much you can use your energy so you can consume your weight .
Also if you cook three times a day your cooking ability will go up .
When people are surrounded by strangers people all think they are watching me so I ca n't do that or this .
But if you eat at home you do n't need to be caring that somebody will look at you open your mouth too big or talk too loud .
Also the restaurant do n't know how much you can eat , so sometimes they give you too less food you do n't get full .
And as you know , throwing food away is a bad habit to do which makes our planet , Earth will be polluted
Fourthly , you wo n't have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and come back home .
And sometimes if there are many customers you have to wait for the chef to cook other 's food first . You can save time if you eat at home .
Of course , it does n't mean that you ca n't talk with families when you eat outside .
But if you eat at home with your family you can have a joke while preparing dishes or talk about their own private life things .
Because it 's not feel free to talk anything outside because the people at the next table might hear what you are talking about .
So by having a family time while eating home you can have a talk and be a much closer family .
Because of these kinds of advantages and reasons I prefer to eat at home .
To sum up , the fundamental characteristic of social media is the design of " Virtual profile " , it requires time to maintain connection between links , friends and be part of groups , this connections will produce negatives effects especially on psychological well - being .
This outcome , along with several studies suggests reasonable use of connection media .
However , it is also likely that people 's life , such as loneliness and depression , might explain the effects that social media can have .
Furthermore , it is also possible that in a future people will be a subject responses , posts and chat rooms , in which awareness of wrong vocabulary , poor routines and compulsive use .
In contrast , one positive aspect of social media cover the education area , in which the knowledge , the expansion of ideas , and the discover of different ways of learning will contribute in the community .
On the one hand we have technology .
Technology has developed really fast in the last twenty years so it 's expected to develop the same way in the next fifty years .
Fifteen years ago cell phones did n't have music or a camera , while nowadays they have camera with high definition and you can download a lot of music .
On the other hand we have transport .
Right now people are starting to buy hydraulic cars which is more eco friendly and cheaper because you do n't need to spend money in gas .
Basing on this we can assume that this kind of cars will be the only ones on the streets fifty years from now .
Every aspect of science will evolve , for example new medical discoveries will be made by doctors .
Chemistry may have the chance in the next fifty years to confirm their theories about the existence of atoms .
To sum up I believe that people lives will change a lot because everything will evolve .
I 'm a teenagers and I like to watch movies as other teenagers .
My favourite kinds are comedis , detective and love stories .
I mostly like comedies because they create my mood put me in high spirites .
They help me to develop and to see the world to a difernt perspective .
People like to watch movies , because it 's a fun pastime and it substitutes books for lazy people .
Many people think living in the counrtyside provides a better way of life .
As we know the countryside has no pollution compared to big towns , because there are n't cars , lorries , moped or any other motor vehicle .
If we lived there , we would eat healthier food with no chemicals , what it 's good .
On the other , hand technology makes our life easier .
We can get information , chat with friends or even order food instantly with Internet , however unfortunately we do n't have it in the countryside
I agree with people who think they would have no problem to leave their lives and start a new job in a farm only to be in touch with nature .
However I think humans have evolved and we are very happy with technology and Internet .
Your car represents a kind of luxury & comfort which is clearly illustrated during driving or travelling for long distances as long as you have a comfortable seat with a certain personal zone area .
Moreover , you can control your driving speed as fast or slow according to your mood and so you own your time .
In addition to that , you can take some rest amidst the journey .
Even after your arrival , you will have your own car to go here & there fleetly & freely whenever you like so you have a flexible schedule .
Furthermore , you are not accompanied by some silly passengers or difficult persons during your trip as you will relish your trip with some adorable friends , nice family 's members or close colleagues that you have chosen .
Besides the presence of a car during a trip is very important for coping with the different conditions environments you are facing during the journey .
On the other hand , public transport now become non hygienic as lots of people are crowded into a small and closed area and so a lot of breathes & air droplets are easily propagated in this enclosed place and consequently , you are more susceptible to the various contagious diseases especially in the winter season where the respiratory tract infections flourish e.g. cold & flu .
Furthermore , your actions and movements are limited by the schedule and the track of the transportation mean you are taking .
And so you do n't own your time to do what you want whenever you like although this is my leisure , my free time which means the time of relaxation & meditation .
No More alarms or noisy alerts are required during this important and nice period of time .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country , the authorities have been arranged amny procedures to ensure that the town keeps clean at the same time be environmentally friendly procedures .
As a first step to keep the environment clean and healthy is that the garbage needs to be separated into 3 parts that is why the environment department decided to give each house three recycle bins , one for food and green garbage , one for only papers and catroons and the last is for the rest .
Another handy rule has been decided which is the plastic and the glasses need to be thrown in different bins that are available for the public udsage in each supermarket center , in these people can find these bins in easy destinations available everywhere .
All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town sitizens in order to improve the environment quality and go long with all the procedures that help them live happily healthy life .
It is more important than ever for anyone to think before using own car .
Firstly , we have a big issue on global warming . We can not deny that we have more and more extreme weather around the glove due to green house gases .
Secondly , we all know the fossil fuels , we mainly run our vehicles by , will not last forever .
We are using up our vital resource in fast pace .
We are used to just turn the lights or air - conditioning on when we do n't really need it .
A lot of us , just turn the engine of our cars without considering walking up to the bus stop .
Public transport system in the UK has so many problems to solve .
The fare is high compared to other European countries and the fare system is complicated .
The punctuality of trains needs to improved greatly , too .
In my opinion , we need to save future for public transport for our future and it is vital to reduce the use of private cars . Travelling by car is more convenient but with improved public transport , we need to reduce use of cars .
That is our responsibility for future generation .
Their main concern is to make you think , laugh , maybe cry a bit , but above all to give you a great time .
To make the long story short - you can not miss this event !
' Gravity ' is an otstanding , brilliant , sci - fi film , directed by Alfonso Cuaron , starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock .
Soon one of them was informed that an asteroid hit a satellite and created debris , which was heading for the Shuttle , where the two astronauts were .
Eventually the debris hit the Shuttle and thus more debris was created which took the orbit of Earth and moved around it with a very high speed .
The damages which the impact of the debris caused to Shuttle were catastrophic !
All of the crew but two were killed .
To survive the astronauts had to get to the International Space Station which was very far away from them .
Moving to the ISS one of them lost his life and so only one of the crew remains alive fighting for the survival .
After the long sequence of events the remaining astronaut first got to the ISS then with Russian spacekraft moved on to the Chinese space station called TIANGONG .
And so the astronaut launched the escape pod and got home !
Her struggle for survival occurs to be successful !
My hometown , Piliyandala , is probably the smallest town in Colombo district provides shelter for more than 100,000 people .
The Garbage control service is one of the main supporting subsidiaries of the urban council which was founded two years ago .
With this garbage control system , household waste being collected on weekly basis and transported to recycling centers .
The recycling centers sort these garbage and are put into different categories to be recycled , categorized garbage are then transported to the recycling process in the nearest factory .
Two years ago , the council started a wastebasket distributing program among the villages with the intention of easing the garbage collection process .
With this approach , it is very convenient for the workers who are engaged in the garbage control service because they can collect all the garbage of a village in one place .
Meanwhile , the urban council highly discourage the use of plastic products and other artificial materials for the sake of our own cleanliness .
Villages on the other hand , doing their best to reduce the load of domestic waste .
Nowadays lots of people are discussing the problems of life in the next 50 years . in 50 years ,
planes , trains and buses will be faster and maybe thanks to the progress of technology we could beam - up every where .
Also thanks to the progress of medicine we will achieve some important goals .
doctors will be able to cure also lethal diseases .
body - communication , for example , will lose his importance . all the communication will be virtual , people will speak only on social networks .
I think that this will be dramatic ! also all relationships and friendships will be virtual , and that is absurd .
we will become robots , no longer people !
What 's about you ?

Thanks for care .
Looking forward to meet you and your family as soon as possible !
Hope we 'll have fantastic holiday together !
Kind regards ,
Faces in the Crowd is an excellent option for those like me who love watching thriller movies .
Despite surviving the attack , Milla loses the ability of recognize faces , and thus she can not tell people apart , which means anyone could be the psycho who tried to kill her , and she could be in great danger .
As time goes by , Milla learns how to identify people 's body gestures , as she becomes more confident with her new ability , her life come slowly back to normal , but not for too long , for she becomes suspicious the murderer can be closer then she would ever expect .
People are young or old , rich or poor , go through stages of ups and downs in their lives .
For most of friends in the dorm of University of Education , Mimi is just an ordinary girl , neither beautiful nor smart .
But for Michael , she is his world .
He loves Michael at first sight when he first met and tried to take any advantages of opportunities to win her heart .
There is no doubt that the Southerner in Vietnam have prejudices against Northerner for a long time .
It is unfortunate for Michael to get access to her because she is a Southerner .
Overcoming much prejudices and obstacles from her family , he proved to be a loyal and sincere man who Mimi can lay her hope on .
But everything has changed since he came to Danang city to further study .
He began to have intimate relationships with other beautiful young girls there and broke his promises- " Wait for me !
I love you forever and I will come back very soon .
In terms of love , he did n't love her anymore but he still kept contact with her .
Poor Mimi!.
She could have got married with a talented man if she had n't believed in what Michael had said to her .
Everything is fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises .
Never in her life had she been to as crowded a city as Danang so she feft very nervous but extremely excited about meeting her lover soon .
Right after from taking off the plane , she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view of satisfying her long waiting for him .
The more excited she is , the more dissappointment she had . Mimi catch sight of her lover was kissing another young girl in his room .
She burst into tears making efforts to leave that room as fast as possible .
Hey!how are you ? How is life going ? Hope your done with your prestigious exams that you told me about .
Anyway I ve recently been organizing an environment saving event for our breathtaking city by doing a recycling campaign .
Since your dad has recycling factory I taught that he would be pleased getting the bottles and the other recyclable material as well .
Aswell as you know in our country there 's trash being thrown everywhere and most of the things that are thrown are recyclabe .
This is the main reason why our environment is getting destoryed .
The charity I chose to invest in was the envirosavers charity , as they have recently done a good job in re - building animal habitats so I taught that they might need money since they just spend money in building habitats .
İn the event there will be charged entertainments for all age groups , there will be live music , we also have a lottery which will be going on .
Waiting for your response and help on they day do n't forget no amount is too small .
The first thing I want to say is that I am really surprised about you finally decide to start with music 's lessons .
Do nt forget to have time enough to go out with your family and friends there !
If I were you , I would try a period of proof for a month .
For instance , you have been doing sport since I met you so as to give up it for a season .
I hope that 's useful.good luck and let me know how you get on .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon
I 'm Vincenzo Manna , an engineering student who , by means of linguaenglish , is going to spend three weeks in Brighton ( as you already know , my colleague Gelsomina Davide and I are arriving next 27th of July ) .
I would like to ask you just a piece of information .
Once I arrive at the airport , is it better to catch a bus or a train which let me reach Brighton ?
Surfing the Internet , I have found that if I catch a bus I will be able to get off in several station ( Coach station , Patcham , Preston Circus and so on ... ) while travelling by train I can choose between Brighton and New Brighton .
So , could you tell me what is the best way to reach your house ?
I hope to improve my English skills thanks to this journey , and especially my listened and spoken English .
Indeed , I think this is the best way to improve , listening to and speaking with native English people .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat so I lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area is changed so rapidly , such as , Now it have a lot of condomedium were buildeda long the main road and nowaday this area has a big shopping mall and modern hospital and large police station that 's make my life so convenience and safe because i can walk from my house to go to shopping mall about 10 minutes other that i can walk to hospital just about 5 minute so i did n't worry when i got sick and The large police station is set in front of the hospital that can assure safety for everyone who live in this area .
For this reason , This is the adventages of living in this area but because of many populations in this area that make traffic in every rush hours especially in the morning very jam and take so long time to drive a car to work that is the disadvantages for living in this area so , In my opinion , this area should have improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to link covered around this area .
They were very excited about choosing the foods on the menu because they were first time eating here .
However , Mary saw a young man with baseball cap taking away something .
When she saw the second time , she found that was Amber 's backpack .
Mary yelled loudly at the young man to call him stop and everyone in the restaurant noticed about him .
The young man dropped down the backpack rapidly and tried to run away .
To his surprised , Amber and the manager of this restaurant had already stood in front of the door .
The manager told them that this guy had stolen many stores in the town , finally they got him .
As a result , even thought he kept expressing his apologist to Amber , she still decided to call the police .
After the police took him away , Mary and Amber kept enjoying their food .
The best of all is that the manager said their meal is free .
Although the two movies are of complete different genres , similarities still exist .
In Rust and Bones , Stephanie injures herself in a brawl outside of a club and wakes up to realize she had her legs amputated .
As they support each other through their hardships , love stems .
Pat had just gotten out of rehab for bipolar disorder whereas Tiffany , a widow , who had just lost her job .
In sum , both movies portrayed love as a chemistry reaction that stems out when two people willing to help each other out of life challenges .
In the movie of Rust and Bone , Ali takes Stephanie going out and swimming , even has sex with her , helping Stephanie to restore her life .
On the other hand , after Ali starts his kickboxing career , Stephanie always cares about his conditions , then becomes his middleman .
Same as Rust and Bone , in the movie of Silver Linings Playbook , Pat companies with Tiffany to break away from the past ; and Tiffany help Pat to get the courage to find the way back into love .
All they want to do is to repair the love meanings and find happiness in their life .
Both the movies lead happy endings to the leads .
In the end of Rust and bone , Stephanie is back to her life because of Ali 's support .
Ali realizes he loves Stephanie and he wo n't be the man he used to be anymore , who do n't believe in love and only want one night stand .
And in Silver Linings Playbook , Pat and Tiffany , who both used to stuck in their misfortune in the pass , leave their pass behind and move on with each other 's love and support .
This two movies give us a concept : no matter how worse the lives are , love can make people brave and find out the value of lives again .
Albeit those things in common , at the beginning of the movies , the depression of characters came from different situation .
Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psycologically difficulties ; Pat 's desire of his ex - wife can not be fulfilled , while Tiffany can not get over her guilty of her husband 's death .
However , characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality ; Stephanie lost her legs , and Ali is an impecunious man .
Although their hearts are all empty , the harsh environment is more hard to survive .
The scene is bright and the rhythm is light even if in the saddest section .
Rust and Bone , on the other hand , presents story in a realistic way .
The director does not avoid brutal scenes because those are exactly parts of real life .
In conclusion , every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways , whereas people could always find distinct inspiration .
In my opinion , being included in the fresh TV news is a huge contribution , great opportunity to introduce yourself in the way you like it .
It is possible to find many examples which confirms that argument .
In these times , we can follow sbd 's Twitter newsfeed , ' like ' his Faceboog fanpage and , of course , follow news about those famous people .
They 're being followed constantly by paparazzi , their private photos are being bought for millions of dollars .
Of course being in a similar situation does n't seem to be easy but I think that it is one of the prices of being famous .
On the one hand , I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems including environmental one .
However , people have exploited the nature since the last century .
Their activities caused lots of negative consequences such as air , water and land pollution , deforestation and climate change .
Whereas developed countries became aware of these problems , poor countries have plenty of societal problems , so they continue to influence the environment in a negative way .
On the other hand , sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal one .
It took place when some natural disasters happened .
It has an unwilling impact on society as people are forced to save their lives , leave or renovate their houses , look for clothes , food and others .
Unfortunately , we can not pretend natural disasters , but we can solve societal problems .
In my opinion , the main decision is to develop people 's potential , increase their awareness of personal effects on nature .
As for me , we can achieve this through developing leadership .
A good leader must form a society , show an example and provide better values for people .
We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and such ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something whereas I do n't know how to do it properly .
I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing country welfare .
Though the new problems occur quickly in our state some people and community , try to do their best to develop the civil and democratic society .
We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environment problems .
Moreover , our country pays little attention to them so population should do everything on their own .
For instance , I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and economizing energy .
These skills are necessary for us , and they help us to improve a little our ecological situation .
In conclusion , each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede a further progress of our civilization .
What is more , this project will give me available experience including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendency in the social sphere and careful attitudes to the environment .
Television can entertain everybody today , it does n't matter the age , can be a baby or an oldest person , we can notice that there are interesting topics for all kinds of audience .
It 's a multimedia device that while you watch TV , you can listen and see other people or cartoons , and it seems the characters are alive talking directly to you .
Today the networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , you can watch the programs at any time you want to , and if you do n't like a program you can change the channel and watch anything else , if the increase of channels and the competitiveness , the audience has increased also its power of choice .
We have the power to choose what we want , but with so many options we must be aware of our own decisions , I want to say that , although we have so many options , not all of them are effective for us , we are able to decide if we 'd rather see a comedy or a documentary .
The programs tend to reproduce our real life and our desires , such as a soap opera which presents characters with difficult in their lives , but there are also the solution of all problems at the end , the lady get married and live happily with his love forever .
Although they have a nice ending we need to remember that the real life is different and the difficult makes part of our lives , they are there to us to give value to everything we have and to remember us how fragile and , at the same time , how powerful we are .
We can also watch a documentary that teach us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so many careful that they provide us with a lot of information , sometimes it 's much better than reading a book or having a class .
In the last 10 years , every second family has more than one car and most of the times each member of the family drives his own car .
Many of the automobile owners live in big towns and often they park their cars in the city centres , where they work or study .
Recently , governments in many countries , put a ban for parking or even a ban for driving in major city centres , because this leads to increasing traffic jams .
In many towns are built underground parking places , where you can leave your car when you have some work in the city centre .
Only public transport is permitted on the main streets , because it is used from lot of people .
They do not like travelling with buses or trams .
In my opinion , these measures related to ban of cars in the city centres are effective and limit the traffic jam and the air pollution .
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' Shakespeare creates a magical mood and setting by using characters , such as the fairies , and events ( such as transforming Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
The use and misuse of magic of magic plays a vital role in ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' .
Each character in this play , who is able to do magic , uses it in a different way , for example : to help ; for their own need .
The good use of magic is when Oberon use ' love in idleness ' to make or rather " force " Demetrius to fall in love with Helena .
He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers relation ship as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia consequently Helena in love with Demetrius .
As Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius and squeezes the potion into his eye , the whole conflict begins .
However , just as magic caused this chaos , it also resolved in it .
There 's be no humour to make it interesting .
It is because of the magic of the fairies , the actions in this book is like a dream .
The fairies nearly control everything .
The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania 's argument , which makes ' contagious fogs'(2:1:90 ) and ' hoary - headed frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
Due to having fairies as characters , it adds magic as fairies do n't exist in the human world .
The beautiful language of the fairies ( verse ) takes us away from the ordinary human world that usually talk in prose .
The fairies ' magic is built by the contrast of the lives of the fairies and " mortals " .
The magic of turning Bottom 's head into one of an ass ' , adds more humour to already the self - confident character of Bottom .
The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seem ridiculous .
Oberon 's use of magic is mainly used to help people .
As well as for his need , he uses his magic to help ' A sweet Athenian lady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) namely Helena with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2 .
In the book , Titania does n't seem to use her magic much , nevertheless , she uses it a few times .
Titania 's uses her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the bride bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta would have beautiful children and live a happy , married life .
In the book , she is n't shown using it for her own need .
Their magic , like Oberon , is used to help people nevertheless not for themselves .
Also , the fairies language is magical as most of their lines are spells and sound as if they were in a fairy tale .
The food they eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as well as not being our daily meals or snacks which also shows another contrast between the humans and fairies .
The fruits , used above , also sound like ones that would be found in a forest(berries ) .
Even the sound of these two words sound like fantasy .
This is how it creates magic and creates the setting as in William Shakespeare 's time , they did n't use many props .
He uses indirect word , e.g. He does n't just say love potion .
Shakespeare says ' Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid 's archery ' causing mystery and letting us think about what he means .
Shakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters for example : when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nature many times .
She refers to the Moon as ' the governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasons quite a lot .
She describes the winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miserable season .
After all the book is called ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' .
Due to the magic , the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream as there 's be no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened .
He adds the play ' Pyramus and Thisbe ' which is a bit like a mini play based on the storyline ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' as there are two lovers whose parents do n't permit their marriage .
When the ' mechanicals ' or workers change into their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The characters in the play like ' moonlight ' are basic ideas of transformations like ones that magic creates .
Also , there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world .
At this time , the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion conjures creates magic .
I personally think , without magic , this book will not be as popular or engaging .
you will enjoy the friendly atmosphere here .
If you like to go shopping , you will have multiple choices .
you can buy souvenirs from the east or west bank .
If you like artworks and antiques , you can go shopping for stone sculptures in addition to papyrus there .
Lovers of gold and silver can get real bargains at bazaar shops .
You will never forget this amazing experience and the fragrance of the land of pharaohs , legends and history .
Nowadays most schools and universities are helping students to find their most suitable jobs .
This is caused by the changes that the labor market has experimented recently .
Enterprises want to recruit young and experienced people and universities and schools have noticed that so they are hands on the task .
It has been suggested to offer " work experience programs " .
Students will be able to know deeply their task as employers .
It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but for the experience that it could bring them .
Some enterprises require experienced employers and if young people have it , they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
So , including in the CV the experience , seems to me , a step further in the students ' career .
Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification .
I entirely share this idea .
Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a work involves .But sometimes universities gives them more theoretical formations instead of practical formation which enterprises are searching .
Generally speaking students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience .
They have to learn the skills that a job involve and the only way to get this is practicing .
Now a day 's we are having " n " number of International Sports , where one can prove their own talent and have their socialism .
My favourite sport is Badminton because we can have lots of fun while playing .
The shape of the court is in rectangle and is divided in half by a net .
The mode of playing can be single 's or double 's .
There are six main shorts : the serve , the clear , the smash , the drop , the forehand and the backhand .
It 's a good exercise to make one fit and easy to play .
The fun in this game is we need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait 's until the opponent responses to it .
My suggestion for the people who wants to start their hobby as badminton , firstly one need to know the rules and regulations of the play .
As it 's a mind set game , the player need to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
To be a successful player one has to learn some tricks , which helps their game easier .
And last but not least as a player one has to keep in mind that , they should not get depressed when they feel that their game is going out of their hands , where instead of that one has to fight until the last mint of the game in order to decide whether the player is winner or loser .
Thus by boosting themselves lead to success .

In Viet Nam , many places are worth travelling such as Da Lat , Sa Pa , or especially Ninh Thuan .
I went to Ninh Thuan two weeks ago , and I could make sure that it is one of the most beautiful beaches in Viet Nam .
From Ho Chi Minh City , you could go easily to Ninh Thuan by train and it takes you only 6 hours .
VH Bay in Ninh Thuan is assumed as one of the best bays in Viet Nam so that I especially recommend you to go there .
To experience well , you should stay here at least three days .
Looking for a job in Viet Nam is not easy for a foreigner like you now .
Just keep thinking about these advise and let me know if you have any concerns .
Meet the Film Club every Monday at the College theatre
A student group use to meet at the College Theatre every Monday for watching films and afterward discuss about them , but you 're not alone !
Each Monday there is invited a different guest speaker to the Film Club for manage the discussion with a good drink thanks to the Coffee Bar special late opening .
Famous directors as Ridley Scott and Alejandro Amenábar came to the club in the last weeks .
They spoke about their films from a point of view that will discover you a new wonderful way of interpret the meaning of the iconic messages that they 've introduce into their movies .
On the next season there 's going to be a new cycle about WWII and Tom Hanks and Matt Damon will visit the Film Club for speaking about the film where they appeared " Saving Private Ryan " and their process to get involved into their characters for a real - like acting .
If you love the cinema or if you only want to take a break in your daily routine and meet new people and make new friends you ca n't lose this great opportunity to turn a grey Monday into an amazing start of the week .
Some people argue that , when the weekend is coming they wonder what to do just for one day!They would like to have a rest .
I 'm suggesting you choose between two different places : beach or mountain .
Fisrt of all , remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess ( Spanish omelette , fried chicken brest , sandwiches , ships ... ) and , moreover , you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming , jumping the waves , surfing and so on .
Playing in the sand burying people one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors .
Nevertheless , if you do n't like sand at all , you can choose the other option in the mountain .
Furthermore , going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy ciy life , though .
Theerefore , which one of these two places would you choose ?
In my opinion , no matter where you go , just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful , amazing even unforgettable moment .
At the end , the most important thing is to have and enjoy a relaxing time .
The purpose of this report is to showcase the in which power consumption is reduced , joined by the saving of natural resources in my city .
In Cluj , in each year , during the summer , the local authorities give citizens the opportunity to rent bicycles , thing that can reduce the air pollution produced by car fumes .
They also encourage people to use bicycles not to consume so much fuel .
Surprisingly , people support this project and every year the number of bicycles rented raises .
More andmore people start wondering about their health , thing that makes them use their cars not as often as they used to .
The localauthorities can also organise events in which they can encourage people tostart saving natural resources like water , or to convince people that power consumption can be reduced in many other ways .
La Cacharreriaes a tapas restaurant so you can choose lots of different , small dishes and share them .
I try something new each time I go there , but I often order the humus , I love it .
the desserts are delicious and original .
The Waiters are really helpful .
They are always happy to explain the different dishes and recommend well .
La Cacharrería has a disadvantage , you ca n't reserve a table and it is very popular .
This is just a quick e - mail to apologise because I forgot to ask you if you want to come to celebrate the end of the year .
Finally , to say that we 're going to eat at Telepizza .
I hope your answer soon .
Sleeping to much is a relief , but for others it can be torture .
Different factors such as stress , psychological problems , noise , lights that do not let you rest .
Mention 3 things we should do to sleep better and be healthy as well , which will discuss below .
The first step to better sleep is to recognize that maybe I can have a sleep disorder .
Taking me as an example , I do not think I have a sleep disorder .
I do not have trouble sleeping , or interrupt my sleep repeatedly .
I sure do not get enough sleep but not a sleep disorder , if not , the pace of life I lead .
The second step is to identify what I could cause the sleep disorder .
Even if you have a disorder , yes I can identify factors that may interrupt my sleep .
The reading speech of many , but with whom I identify most is caffeine before sleeping and eating heavy before bedtime .
I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and that way I can see improvement .
The third and final step is to try to identify problems at first .
Help and put into practice these tips will help us have a healthier life .
Read things that can help us live better can be very helpful .
Implement each council and tell others about your improvements , is a good way to help others .
So for now we must sleep well to be healthier .
I like many types of sports but I prefer swimming .
I practise it every day in my school .
To practise this sport first you have to meet someone who teaches you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport but it is also dangerous .
If you try it you can do it .
Some people think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
However , it does n't mean the public transport have to disappear .
The main reason to consider there is future for public transport is that , according to ecologists , we must cut down the massive use of cars .
Then , the public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet .
What 's more , not only increases it the pollution , but also turns out to be dangerous for our sense of hearing .
In addition , I think the public transport is a necessary service which we should have access to .
Everyone ca n't afford a car or , for any reason , are n't able to drive one .
Therefore , it is too important to go on with a public transport business now and in the future .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport but we 'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in accurate conditions .
Dear Mr .
Please find below clarification related to the below issue :
During a meeting with head of the department in MOH I was complaining about service of the microscope by their staffs ( almost 99.9%from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract , and handling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested to provide the required training for his all staffs , in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service .
Next day I have received a call from one of the technician Mr. Humam Altannous ( who was compliant against us ) and asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lab ( which are not under warranty or Contract ) .
I explained to him the standard protocol that it should be send a official repair request in order to proceed with repair the unit .
But he is not ready to accept it and asking us to come and repair the unit without any repair request issued . please note that our telephone conversation was only for 2 minutes and during this conversation he was misbehaving and mistreating me and hang - up the phone ) .
He was not asking any Manual / trouble shooting instruction during our call what he mentioned in his email .
Next day I was compliant against him with the Head of the department , during that time only I came to know that he is one of the technician who is taking care of repairs of the Microscopes in the department , and his Manager requested me to not repair any unit without official request , beside he will come back to me regarding my complaint against his employee .
Please note that we are keeping a good relation with our customers and always giving our good service as well .
We hope that above explanation is sufficiently clear and exhaustive .
Due to there will be an international festival for young people in our region , I have written that report in order to know the preferences of them and the trends which are on nowadays .
Firstly , I have asked about the music that is listened to and about their favourites styles and groups and the results showed us that they are n't similar compared to music they liked a few years ago .
In fact , they hardly ever can defined themselves such as pop fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plenty of girls who were interviewed told they could n't stand reggaeton music , however they used to want to listen to it in discos because they could dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't have musical culture and magnificent bands of music like Rolling Stone are going to have remaining in the oblivion .
Secondly , I debated with young people to television programmes that are watched currently .
Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people in order to gossip about them .
However , the documetaries are being forgotten and only a twenty - six percent of them would like watching more interesting TV series like Lost .
Moreover , all of them choose watching TV against reading a book as first option .
It is said that you are that you are wearing but in this report , we can check that it is not certain .
Actually , in opposition to the music , young people feel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by which the clothes are being worn .
Nowadays , all people use the Internet and application everywhere .
Moreover , it is very easy to make friends and communicated with somebody .
First of all , thanks to the internet you can meet or talk to people even if not by your site .
In addition , it 's easier to talk with someone that you do n't meet and you want it .
Secondly , if you use the Internet to meeting new people , it 's a good way to finding people with similar interest . You can enter application and you can explain how you look like and someone is interested in you .
Finally , I think that thanks to the internet you can talk with someone who live in Japan , but often you stop talking with someone who is yours front .
In conclusion , I 'm agree that Internet it 's a good way to meeting friends because you can know a lot of people around the world .
The statement - ' There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . ' can be discussed in two different aspects .
One way of using transport is to daily travel to work within the city , other way is to use it when you are visiting your friends or family outside the city .
There have been good progress in transport in both the aspects .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and it can be attributed to lot of factors such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
People who travel daily to work , usually prefer public transport over own car as it is a cheaper option .
Also , as public transport such as metro do not need to face traffic , it is always faster way to reach office .
On the other hand if I would be travelling to see my friends or family in nearby town or just on holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
If you are travelling in your car , it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination , you can make any number of stoppage , and even stop for your favorite ice cream .
In future ; environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these transport mediums .
Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints , they are trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative will surely help countries to reduce pollution .
I think education is one of the most important thing for everyone .
In my opinion , it is , probably , the base of the values of every society because our children from now will be the men or women of the future .
In Spain the vast mayority of schools are state schools .
This is the reason for the government decisions of education play an essential role . I have always thought that it should be reached for all .
I studied in a state school and I believe that I get a good education not only academic training but also strong principles to live in society .
The internet and social networks have involved a big change in our knowledge and behaviour front to the world .
From my point of view I feel like we are losing things so important as the effort to reach goals or respectful everyone .
Nowadays , we are living in a global world and we must learn how to live together therefore the education is the only way to achieve it .
For instance , knowing other languages , like English is increasingly day a day .
To sum up , education is , in my opinion , the most important base of any society and it should be reached whole people .
No doubt people need to move from a place to an other .
There are many reasons for travelling , and to travel from one place to an other people use different means .
there are variety of transport mean .
Public transport means such are trains , planes and buses are known as the most cheap and used by all travelers , and the coast of using them is something that suits the people who earn not so much money .
Where as the private means such as cars and small planes are known as the most expensive .
Their fuel and kits are rather expensive .
The user of the transports mean are differ , the public ones are able to carry big number of travelers , where as the private means used by very little number of people .
This option may be applied on the cargo also .
because the public means of transport can carry a lot , and this help to move cargoes to every where with low coast .
All these points are support the importance of the public transport means , and ensure how useful they are .
In my view , the public transport will keep on offering their services , and will never be effected by the appearance of private means .
This report is intended to evaluate the Active Leisure Club and to give some suggestions to the Club 's new facilities .
I believe that should be taken in mind when the new facilities are built .
The Club offers a wide range of activities to spend time .
Everyone on the organisation was kind , helpful and cheerful .
Although facilities are well organised , they are too small since more and more people are becoming members of the club .
However , the advantages overcome the worst aspects and I will be happy to join the club again next Summer .
I 'm very sorry that I haven't replied earlier , but I had hard time at university .
In my opinion Poland is beautiful country , so you will not be disappointed ! I would recommend you starting your trip in Poznan .
It 's beautiful city !
If so , I recommend you to explore Stołowe Mountains - in my opinion it 's the most beautiful place in Poland .
If I were you , I would start looking for a job with checking local advertisements on the Internet .
to who may concern
Hereby I am writing in reference to the advertisement published for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , in order to apply for the job

Sincerely ,
Nowadays there are many people who practise sports , but other people prefer just watching them .
Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life , you focus on the competition and is like to have a rest from the cotidian life .
On the other hand , doing sports is healthy , despite the fact that there are risky sports that can cause several health problems and could lead you to death , only watching sports seems safer .
In conclusion , personally despite the danger of some sports , doing sports is by far better than just sit in your house and watching them .
Dear sir / madam ,
I 'm so glad to hear that you give me an opportunity to make your club facilities improvement .
It would be a great chance for your club to share my ideas to improve your facilities
Please refer to the good and bad points of your club in my view as below ,
The good points of the club are as below ,
The bad points of the club are as below ,
The temperature of the changing room is too low .
I would like to recommend that the gym opens 7:00 AM for the people who want to visit there little bit earlier and the heating changing room should be fixed .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you that my reply could be a great tip for your club this year .
yours sincerely ,
The last film i saw was called " The others " altough is not a recent film .
The film is a horror movie which tells the story of a rich family who lived in an old mansion in an abandoned island after the second world war .
The problem about this mansion is that the same hides a lot of secrets and misteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners who are a family whose husband went to war and died so the real ocupants of the house are nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister anne who turns to be one of the most important characters of the film and their mother who is called grace and has a particulary obsession for catholisism .
The other characters that also take an important part in the movie are the servants .
Bertha / mr.tuttle and the mute girl lidya who also hides a lot of secrets .
The film descrives how the love that a mother can give to her children can easlily turn into an obsession.however,what makes this film so special is that that pretends to be a typical horror movie but at its final scene there is a suddenly change wich turn it more interesting .
I would recomend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared scared because it is not as the resto of horror movies , it is a film in which you are continuely discovering secrets as if you where another character .
You will have a great time
Public transport is the vehicle for passenger who can travel from one place to another in less money .
At first this transport was appreciated marvelously .
Everyone felt so delighted but unfortunately now people feels uncomfortable when it comes to travel via public transport .
In early days of public transport , people were only stick to their normal routine and did not wish to earn more from their job or work .
Today every single person is curious to earn money as much as they can and the interesting part is that this curiosity is increasing day by day so is their income .
So now almost 80 percent people can afford their own transport .
As people feel comfortable in there own vehicle .
The main advantage of having your own transport is that you do not have to wait for the public transport , you can save your time as you only need to accelerate your own transport and drive to your destination .
Public Transport is slow now , even though they are very comfortable but unfortunately people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class would travel through public transport it would affect his respect .
But still there are so many people who use public transport frequently but that is only their compulsion and poverty .
When they would be financially stable they would surely buy their own vehicle .
So in my opinion I agree with the statement that there is no future of public transport .
It is a well known fact that transport is quite related with pollution .
The exhumed fumes are one of the great problems for the environment .
So that it is a cuestion that required a deeper reflexion for all of us .
Wheter public transport might be the solution , or be more adeccuate or not , it is something with arguments in favour and against .
Firstly , many people think public transport has not future because travelling by car is faster and more independent .
You do not to wait for a specific time to cath the bus , for example .
Secondly , people think buying a car is a cheaper option in long term than travelling by public transport every day .
However , a lot of people are becaming more and more consciencious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of the most important reasons is precisily to take care of the environment .
Using public transport reduce the pollution .
What is more , when we speak about pollution we are not only talking about exhumes fumes .
I am very happy with the idea to encourage the public transport 's use due to make the cities a better place to live .
If everyone travelled by bus , cities would be a quite different the ones we know now .
I really liked to work with special effects and the best thing that I learnt a lot about that tehnology .
Public transportation is the most popular method in travelling to places .
These transportation can be easily found anywhere to reach your destination .
In addition to this , we would not take too much time in looking for a bus which would go specifically to our destination .
But we can not deny the fact that public transportation has been around in years and in every country as a means of travel .
Most of the people prefer this kind of transport , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
Moreover , this has helped a lot of people especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
The side effect of depending only on cars as the main transportation are remarkable .
we should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has huge number of cars run on it 's streets and this number is going up speedy .having this huge increasing of cars that will impact badly in public health & environment and infrastructure .
It is more convenient with modern lifestyle to travel with a car because of the privacy and independently.the remarkable development of car 's luxury and more option .
although it will be over cost in full , car service and effort of concentration on driving all of this negativity you can avoid it easily by using public transportation , it should be cheaper than using your own car you do not have to look after it you can do activities wail you are on it like reading or chatting with your friends or having important phone call
The environment impact is an important factor we should consider , having this number of cars like having thousands of factories in our streets giving us tans of CO2 gas and many other pollution gases.the speed new train or plans or even buses now competing withe car 's speed and even more fast than it in a lot of places .
Using public transportation is better than use individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside it and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury means , expanding in electric car and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environment 's pollution as far as we can .
I have never forgotten that funny story about baseball match .
So sport is my hobby , a nice method of having a rest , spending some new unusual life .
Most of all I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton .
There was a such time when I was visiting volleyball club , but I gave it up .
Badminton is what I consider to be favorite .
It 's easy , interesting and funny .
You can train your hands , reaction and legs , because it needs much run .
Usually I do this kind of sports with my sister .
Moreover , I like to do different physical exercises every morning .
When it 's a good weather , I enjoy jogging near the house .
To my mind , bike is the best way of traveling .
It 's also useful for cardiovascular system .
I 'm absolutely convinced , everyone should realize that the most important is health and sport really can help .
If you want to keep your body in a good form , you ought to go in for it .
If your figure is nice , you will have a nice mood , wonderful feelings .
So it 's better to choose sport instead computer in order to relax , feel positive emotions .
Having lived during the century , which provided humanity with glass houses , question ponders , how will the home of the Future look ?
Predictable , some of the solutions will remain intact .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comfort .
House is to be divided between chambers in order to preserve the privacy of the occupants .
Pieces of furniture , namely chair , table and bed , would remain unchanged .
Nonetheless , the changes will be visible on the interior as well as the exterior .
Furthermore , they will be ecological , the main reason using renewable sources of energy .
The electronics will undergo the most evident changes .
The screen will be no longer required for the computers and TV .
All electronic devices will be controlled by the voice thoughts .
I appreciate also that it is located near to the housing estate .
In my opinion parking charges are too high .
The parking should be free of charges , it would attract more people and increase the income overall .
Moreover , you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area to certain sections ( e.g. clothes , food , and house ) .
I am very lucky because not far from my home there are three parks so I can practise this sport whenever I want .
Usually I jog three days a week and , honestly , I could n't do without !
Running in contact with nature allows me to relax after work and recharge my energies .
Once finished my training , I go home , take a shower and ... I feel like a new woman ! !
They can begin to jog for 15 minutes and then increasing the time so that their body can get used to the muscular effort .
Furthermore , it would be useful having a chronometer to check out your improvement .
I would also recommend to stretch after every work out to avoid any kind of muscular pain .
If you prefer , you can substitute stretching with few yoga exercises as well .
Among young people exist a statement that shopping is always an enjoyable way to spend your free time .
Personally I am not completely agree with this way of thinking .
On the one hand , if you have money and a lot of free time you can spend all day dodging in the mall for only one , special kind of skirt or pair of jeans .
But if you do not have money , prices can only destroy your day because you know that you can not afford it .
The prices in the shops often are very high and clothes are not good qualitatively .
And when you want to buy something in lower price , you need to go to the mall when there are seasonal sales .
But then everybody goes crazy , you need to crowd through the mob , argue with another person for one , special pair of shoes in your size .
For me it is only a torture .
Also you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets .
Otherwise you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need , every thing on the rack is calling for your attention , after a while you want to buy everything .
On the other hand if you find a real bargain and buy something in very low price , you will be happy and content for the rest of the day .
But in my case , it happen rarely .
Some people do not want to buy things by network because they want to try on for example clothes .
For me it is not necessary because every seller gives the size of his product and then I can check if this thing will be good for me or not .
Also you can always return it like in the stationery stores .
Summing I prefer doing my shopping by means of websides or auction portals .
There I can easily find what interests me , what is in my size etc .
For me it is easier and faster way to buy what I want , often in better price .
The diagrams illustrates the process of making bank notes .
The first step is design which includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then move to the next step , preparation of metal plates , while skilled machinists is needed in this process .
Printing is quite related to the first two steps because the design and skilled machinists should both be considered .
And when the sheets of bank notes are being printed , colour on both sides , special ink and slightly raise image should on the bank note .
The most important step is inspection , where printed sheets should be inspected manually and carefully .
It divides sheet of bank notes into three types , which are good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets or bank notes separated into good and bad and bad sheets .
If the quality of sheets and bank notes are good , then they will be packaged and distributed .

Thanks
Sincerely ,
You can watch reality shows , cartoons and wherever you want .
You can see international channels and live shows around the world , something that in the past could be too good to be true .
On the other hand , when we think about the currently program 's style , even those shown on paid tv , it seems that nothing has changed .
they keep producing the same kind of programs , the same kind of movies and soap operas .
Moreover the repeating is massive , I bet that at least once a week you can find that old series called friends , ca n't you ?
Even knowing that not too much has changed our options nowadays still make the television a very good tool to get a family together and spend an enjoyable time .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with your service I received when I spent a night at your hotel on 20th March 2014 .
Firstly , I must inform you that I am dissatisfied with the hotel receptionist because he forgot to place my wake - up call and as a result I overslept and I missed my flight .
I would recommend you to improve your standard and quality of service and to draw your attention to the stuff in your reception .
I believe you give this matter your urgent attention .
I feel that you should refund my cost of staying at your hotel and I demand refunding the cost of another plane ticket I had to buy .
I look forward to receiving your reply or I will be forced to take a legal action .
I am writing to inform you about one of the most interesting place in our town .
There is a lot outstanding views and worth visiting places but let me tell you about the Warriors Museum .
It looks like a castle and there are many rooms with archery from IX to XX .
The torture room is very popular with children but eager fans can also find something suiting them .
Guides are helpful and brainy - you can ask them any questions and they will answer .
The breathing landscapes you can see from a museum are also a great advantage .
The museum is located near the center of city , you can get there by bus in 5 minutes or go for a walk for about 15 minutes .
The first time practicing Muay Thai was 5 years ago , at that time I was n't sure of practicing it because I did n't consider myself strong enough for fighting , that 's what most of the young people think , at least in Mexico and some other countries , and that 's one reason why people do n't practise Muay Thai and is not known .
Well , you should know that bodily strength is very important in this kind of sports but is not the most important thing , mental strength is also important ; a mix of both strengths are necessary , remember the body does what the mind commands .
Was hard at the beginning just like when you start doing something new , so here are some tips if you want to start practicing Muay Thai .
When you practise any sport , you have to be confident on yourself , without confidence you will not have any progress .
Muay Thai is a complete sport , you use arms , legs , elbows , knees , feet and more , that means you have to do a big effort .
Practice makes better , do research about Muai Thai 's culture , do research about Muai Thai 's methods .
You know you like a sport when you enjoy it and you feel comfortable to practise , that 's what I recommend do , enjoy and be happy practicing because Muay Thai is a beautiful sport !

Mike was one of the best awardees in the class .
He 's been doing great in both academic and extra curicular activities in the school .
He is one of the players of basketball since he was an elementary student until now he 's on college .
As the tournament began he 's been getting a high points for his team because of that nice contribution they have won the game .
It had been a very extensive and tiring day to all of them but Mike felt he had achieved something really good because fortunately he was won as the most valuable player too .
He 's not only doing excellently as a student however he 's been known as one of the popular students because he works voluntarily as a couch to the younger kids in his town .
So in their generation they have something good that they contribute in the society at their very young age .
It might be a simple way but perhaps the society would be proud on what are they doing .
the mistake is something you may do unintentionally however , people believe that mistakes can later be improved or ignored whereas , sometimes we may make mistakes that could break somebody 's heart .
Michael was a teenager therefore was not mature as a an adult thus his decision were all emotional .
it was Christmas eve and a new girl came to the college .
Who was not only fair but very attractive girl .
As soon as she entered the college gate everybody was smitten by her .
Michael had a very good and an old friend who had been with him in his goods and worse .
And they both had a great understanding however , this innocent girl had grabbed the attention of all the viewers similarly , the two .
The girl liked Michael 's friend Henry .
Michael could not digest this fact since he could not compromise on anything .
Michael thought of a dirty game he called , Henry at a birthday party and took him on the terrace and pushed him down .
Henry kept on shouting to stop and not to betray his oldest of the friend . "
do not do such a thing that would make you regret later"Henry said .
Henry fell down and his head was injured Michael left him to bled profusely and later a pedestrian saw his body tried to look at his pulse rate but encountered that he was dead .
Later the girl discovered that Michael was all behind the incident .
After the inquiry Michael was put behind the bars and the girl went away .
And Michael just had the regret all the way later
Have you ever thought about what your life would be in the next 50 years ?
If you are old enough , you can see how far the technology has gone in the last 20 years .
It 's quite amusing to try figuring out what the life in the future could be .
First of all , oil should be overcome as a source of energy .
Provided that renewable sources will be developed enough , we could live without pollution .
And there could also be robots , why not ?
Medicine should have won a lot of diseases and maybe it could be ready to overcome aging .
On the one hand we could live in a more relaxed way , on the other hand we colud think about settling on other planets .
Finally , you can think it will be a green , peaceful enjoyable world .
There is no secret , that everybody needs at least one person to share his troubles or happiness with .
As a rule , a friend or psychologist play this role .
We must pay to receive the psychologist 's attention , but friendship is free of charge .
Every day for we are looking for friends .
It 's a way to deal with external world .
What if you 're alone and no one can understand you ( and you have no money and insurance to visit psychologist ) ?
Your parents always maintain and defend you , they are happy just to see you - their child , the result of their love .
They treat you for who you are and know all your faults , but still love you .
My parents are my best friends because I can trust them , love them and look forward our meeting .
Thank your parents if they are alive and think if you would become a good friend to your future child .
Until now all is normal in his life .
However , when Sergio finished his studies he was hired by Microsoft in United States .
He had everything that any person would want to have : live abroad , earn much money , have a partner , work in an international business , an so on .
He did not want to earn much money , what he truly wanted was to earn enough money to travel around the world , and not a job which does not allow to do his hobbies , although it gives him a lot of money .
Then Sergio left Mycrosoft , created his own website which gave him enough money and travelled wherever he want .
Now he is a famous person on internet because of his blog : ' Live to the fullest ' .
Sorry that I haven't written before but my mother had been using the computer all the time for work and I had to wait until she finished her work .
First , I think that 's a fantastic idea go to the new activity centre . We 'll enjoy a lot and meet new places .
Sounds perfect for me !
As you asked me , I rather sailing on the river than climbling a wall because I want to connect with nature .
If we have extra time we can do the other activity whether you want .
At night , we can stay at home , as you said , and also we can buy chocolates and see a movie , that 's great for me !
But you can tell me other option when to go to your home .
Finally , I 'm afraid my parents ca n't take me to your home on Friday evening , because it 's my grandfather 's birthday .
The population grows , with more business skyscrapers , residential houses and advanced transportations , at the cost of diminishing farmland , wetland as well as deforestation .
Though the modern cities emerging repaidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the enviorment are severly various .
The red coral reef off coast in Austrialia , for instance , serve as shelter for algea and other sea tiny fishes and index of enviroment fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there are cut off and enviromental variations are gone away .
On top of that , It is the regulation capacities of enviorment that for temperature , moisture and even the sandstorms are erode as less plants engage inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen the whole system .
What 's more , extreme weather appears with EL NINO periodically causing catastrophic floods in northern cities in China and long - lasting drought in South American .
For the population density is ever - increasing currently , the loss triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family .
In a response to address these side affects that the civilization bring about , governments must take measures stey by step to tackle them .
Firstly , governing authorities should set up protect area for animals and plants , inhibitating hunting or even leisure activities like hiking .
Apart from the natural areas , the minimual areas for forests and wetland have to be ensured .
Secondly , government must fund environmental organizations , in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop the illegal hunting , deforesting and animal extinctions .
Furthermore , the government should go out of their ways stand united in a way which joint endeavours could be effective globally .
In conclusion , government are supposed to balance the modernization and sustainable development .
I want to tell you about the concert in my school , it was really cool .
We prepared it for a long time , but I had wonderful experience .
My friend Make showed me how best to play the role of snow White , it was very funny .
We had hard days also , we argued , but then quickly put up .
During the concert one boy forgot the text and began to improvise .
The course is going to finish so the teacher want that we go out to a restaurant .
At last we decided to go to a restaurant near the school .
The atmosphere is kind and familiar .
The prices are not expensive and foods are very good .
There is also a garden outdoor where we can spend a pleasant time together after lunch .
We will eat a legume soup as start , a boiled fish with green salad as main course and a dessert at the end .
Therefore I want to say a special thanksgiving to our teacher .
I see most of them like to stay at the garden downtown during the afternoon when the weather is good .
If the weather is n't good enough they can find a lot of cafes opened from morning until late night and here , if they are old enough they can also order alcholics .
There are many kinds of cafes , the ones for those who like sports , art , literature or music .
At the " Soft Notes " you can ear music played live every Friday and Sunday evening .
A lot of kids like to join the park next to the church : it 's not related to religion , here every child is free to come and play .
In this place there are guys and girls attending pedagogy organize activities to entratain children of every age .
The most rated restaurant is " Mario 's Pizza " , where you can eat delicious pizza with the top you prefer .
While waiting for it , you can play with video games placed in the basement .
Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter of discussion .
Public transport include buses , trains , and subway , however cars , bicycles , taxis are not forgotten .
In the moment of choosing , very different aspects like ecological effects , the economic viability and even time uses , take part on the decision .
Firstly , the car option is the best one in comfort , because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities .
Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one , because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour .
By the other hand , traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport , cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and , depending on the city , the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains .
However , the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience , cars are the most expensive ones .
Not only because of the oil'prices , but also the costs of enssurance , the car , the parking taxes , etc .
In comparisson with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come .
To sum - up , neither cars nor public transport is considered the perfect option , but considering long term consequences as is nowadays common in some European countries , bicycles are the best way .
Riding a bicycle reduces traffic , costs , ecological impact , and even car crushes .
So , what are you waiting to buy a bicycle and put a helmet on ?
Say hello to Anne on my behalf and tell her I ca n't wait to have you both here in Rome !
I 'd fancy living in a family and not in a college or in a shared flat as it will give me the opportunity to be continuously in touch with English people , day and night ; then , it is the ideal solution for me : you know I 've been recently given the sack !
What about lookig for colleges which offer Wi - fi Internet connection and a proper meal at lunch ?
Looking forward to receiving your new letter , and on tenterhooks for the information you 'll provide .
Fashion , clothes style , trendy appearance , make - up properly , the hear ...
Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our life ; but , it should be like this ?
It is certainly true that people are very critic with the appearance .
We have subjetive opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconception idea .
We match clothes stile with a lifestyle and a personality .
That is why appearance should not have consequences in our lives .
Most people would agree that fashion is something that takes part in our day to day .
Normally , people choose clothes that famous wear or appear in the magazines .
However , there are people who do not follow that , and they dress the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most .
For example , in work interwies and work that have a direct contact with the public it is better to use a for or smart style .
And same happened with parties , festivals , sports and other events .
Overall , my personal opinión is that we give so much importance to the clothes and the appearance than it should be .
Although in some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our life .
The death of the public transportation
People do not think about the environment , they only think about the time that they will spend on the traffic . the scientists said the new society it can be called " the fat society " because the the people do not want to do any exercise , people do not walk anymore , people just use elevators , etc .
a lot of commodities , this is ta reason of why there are not future for public transportation , people do not wanna spend few time walking to the bus station or tu get a cab , although the service in the public transportation it is not very good because of many things like the inflation of prices , the way that the bus or cab driver refers to the persons , the way of the bus or cab drivers drives , etc .
In cities like Mexico some people have the opportunity to use Uber , that is a service that you can use if you have a credit card , it is an amazing service , but not all the population have car or the economic status to use an uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the buss or cab driver yell them or drive bad , in Mexico the public transportation in specific the cabs are not a very secure service , because some of the drivers still and kindnap , in may situation they can kill you if you do not have your precautions . but despite of this is very sad that in that place people can not do some thing because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more so they have to took .
In cities like United Sates of America where people have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged social condition so for the American people public transportation it does not matter , they have the possibility to take public transportation or not , they can decide , so they decided for commodity .
The future of the public transportation can be death or can be in growth , it depends on were do you position your point of view , in Mexico maybe will never die , but in the United States the public transportation is now in agony .
She woke up and at once she felt something makes her happy .
She wondered who could make such a pleasant surprise .
Suddenly , she remembered that for three days she living with Chuck - her boyfriend .
She ate breakfast , dressed up and go to work .
It was the first day of Spring and everything is going rise to life .
Flowers was in every colour of rainbow , the leaves on the trees going green .
When she came to office , she saw on her desk a note with a heart shape .
Anna opened it and read : " Probably this day will be the best day of your life " .
She smiled and thought that is a joke .
But moment later she found a second letter about the same shape .
Anna looked at her watch and as fast as she can run to the park .
It appers that at the fountain stay Chuck and waiting for her .
When she come closer he knelt on one knee and said : " Will you marry me Anne ? " .
She was run out of words and just nod her head what it means : " yes " .
They together come back home and spend rest of the day together .
At the end of the day she said : " You 're right .
Sarah and Stephan are friends in the same school and also neighbors .
One day in the afternoon , they were on the way home .
Sarah focused on her cellphone , and Stephan was listening music loudly with his MP3 .
After few minutes , Sarah was chatting happily on the cellphone and did n't see there was a tree in front of her , so she bumped into the tree and hurt her head .
Sarah yelled loudly for help , but Stephan did n't notice and hear that so he kept on walking and listening to his music .
Fortunately , there was a mother with her child strolling behind them , and saw Sarah got hurt .
Stephan still listening to the music and crossing the street .
But he did n't aware that the traffic light has turned red so the car could n't go through .
The man in the car was very annoyed and pushed the horn seriously , but Stephan did n't hear that .
The man got down the car to tell Stephan stop listening to the music and pay attention with things around him .
Not until that Stephan found that Sarah was lost did he call Sarah .
And he knew that Sarah was in the hospital .
Luckily Sarah was fine due to the woman who was walking behind them had called the ambulance at once .
After these incidents , not only Sarah but also Stephan realized how dangerous it was when you focused on technological products instead of the things around .
Both they are determined to pay more attention to the surroundings .
I just read the first book in a trilogy called The Hunger Games .
It is an action and thriller book written by Suzanne Collins .
Katniss the protagonist is a teenage girl 16 which is forced to poach to feed his family since his father died
An increasing number of people begin to discuss for the success in school or work , the having an ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge or a field of study .
The majority of people tend to claim that having an excellent knowledge or the research field is the most important for school or work successfully .
However does the claim really ring true , conforming the real situation ?
I find myself not on the same wavelength with such an idea .
It is my contention that the people , who have the ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances have higher percentage be successful in school or work .
As far as I concern , there are a bunch of reasons to support me perspective .
To begin with , acquiring the knowledge in today 's world is not a difficult things than it was in the past .
That is to say , the investment of the internet make it available for everyone in the world .
People can easily obtain the lasted knowledge by owning a computer that can access to the network and have the ability to reading .
In other words , the way to get the knowledge is equal to everyone in the world .
That is why it is not to be the key point that considered the key to success .
In addition , the education has already across the wealth gap .
To explain , there are a trend that many universities all over the world setting up the freely courses for the people who thirsty for knowledge , also often invited the famous scholar to give a speech to the public that is welcome for everyone .
People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interesting in .
Thus , everyone might be an expert .
Excellent performance in the field of study has not been determined of factors for your success .
A case in point would be the latest news broadcasted recently .
According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank , the percentage of people using the knowledge in the work field that they from school has surprising reduced in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent , a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of half - century .
Say it simply , the things that school teach us were no longer be used in the real world .
This phenomenon had been curiously many experts .
Does the knowledge from school have any different in the work field ?
However , after deeper analysis , we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast pace changing world and the text book can not catch up with it , knowledge is changing from time to time .
Hence , this research remained us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor to success instead of having excellent knowledge or a field of study .
They may say that having excellent knowledge or a field of study is the way to success in school or work .
However , I think the reasons I have provided in favor of my view point are stronger .
Nowadays , the statistics show that many people are younger than generations before .
I think there are more younger parents because they do not live in a religious life which is far more stricter .
Previously , the most women used to get a baby after the wedding with their partners , but today , it is not so important anymore .
Actually the teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children .
Apart from this the small difference between the ages is also an advantage .
Although less experience is owned , they recognize what a child wants to do .
On the other hand a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their babies without having experience on that .
In my age young parents and I have in common that we go out in the evenings .
From my point of view older parents can give better advice in every difficult situation .
So the child grows up from a teenager to a middle - aged adult and can always looks up to the parents .
However the progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life so I believe both are good at bring up their children .
Tom had faith this day will be better than the others .
He did n't recover yet from the last scare he had that day .
He sat on his chair and looked to the window .
" ..... " he looked to his hands .
He shook his head and looked to the ceiling .
He started to make his homework , but he had trouble concentrating as the memories came back to his mind .
" I can't ... do it " he slammed his head on the desk .
" I ca n't "
He looked to the bathroom door and walked to it .
The same face as ever .
When he looked down the bathroom he saw something on the floor .
" Tom . Tom . Tom . Tom " it said .
He turned the note to see something
" 1992 - 2015 "
You are late to your death date "
Everybody has got some ideas , how to live their own life .
It is very important to think about possibilities that should create your fortune .
There are two things that most impinge my life .
First , it is my family that helps me to make a good decision . I live with my husband more than ten years , so we know each other quite well to support the other one .
A big family is a great base for happy living together under one roof , but secrets are strongly forbidden .
If somebody in my family ask me to help I need to know the whole true without any potential lies .
That is why I learn my children to play fair .
On the other hand there is one other most important thing in my life- health .
I am more than happy that I am healthy and my family members are healthy as well , because health is the rarest thing in the world .
There is only one thing in the world that you can not buy and it is a health .
It is well known true through the whole men that health is fair to the rich and poor equally .
In conclusion I have to think about one thing , which is more important in my life that the other one .
I will always choose the health , because when a person is healthy he or she can do everything .
There are some solutions to prevent the rise in the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks .
The first solution is change portion size of soft drinks , which means smaller size of beverages could contain less sugar .
National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) points out that the most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar sweetened soft drinks .
Therefore , changing portion size of soft drinks would be efficient to reduce sugar intake for teenagers each time .
The limitation of this solution is the public may not satisfied with this size of soft drinks .
To overcome it , the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it .
This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverage decrease sugar intake efficiently .
Family education would be introduced to their kids .
National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) reports that teenagers are main soft drinks consumers and the most consumption of beverage is sugar sweetened drinks .
Parents ' words is key to restrict their kids ' actions .
They would not consume such amount of beverages .
That requires parents building a model to show positive effect without soft drinks .
Therefore , their kids would follow parents ' habits and behaviors .
In conclusion , increasing the consumption of soft drinks is one of issues to prevent from obesity and overweight .
Teenagers are main target who drink too many soft drinks .
So that parents education and changing portion size could be useful to address the problems which happens around teenagers .
If we take these measures within a short period and keep it for a long time , obesity and overweight problem would not happen in our next generations .
We can say that the Coyle 's idea is well developed thanks to two features that pass through the chapter and likely the entire book : first of all , many significant references and specialized people are mentioned to define what " deep practice " is ( a psychologist , some experts in their own field , authors who already analyzed that particular topic … ) ; secondly , but no less important , Coyle himself collected the most of his information while visiting at least nine places , nine " hotbeds " ( 12 ) where talents grow , as a sort of collection of data gathered from laboratory experiments .
As a consequence , theory and examples proceed together in a such natural way , that the reader must exclaim undoubtedly , as if she / he were before a Sherlock Homes ' investigation : « That 's it !
Coyle 's right ! »
In my days friendship was easily made with neighbours , schoolmates and social clubs friends .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other more than these virtual frienships prevailing today .
I already exprienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a benficiary association established for youth friendship .
In which we have to wait more than thirty days to send and receive one message that interchanges these days with one button press .
I have a personal experiment backs to 1987 , in this year I had started a pen friendship with a German girl called Claudia who was 17 years old then .
The surprise is today I am 44 years old and Claudia is 40 years old and we still correspond to each other through the modern means of Facebook and Whatsapp , of course , we no longer can wait for thirty days while we can chat and see each other live .
In my country I have two sincere friends since we were about 7 years old and we still in a strong friendship up till now .
It is not necessary to agree with each other in everything where we always debate and challenge whose opinion is correct .
Real friendships everlasted like what I am actually made with my best two friends , should be founded on trust and faith .
The best of all in real frienships is to always believe in your friend 's abilities and be his real mirror for good and bad actions , he will be the same to you .
As I am in my late 20s I 've found it hard to find a sports activity that would neither be so competitive as those in fashion in my country nor demanding , so I could do it in my free time .
One fine summer day I was walking along the streets of a coastal city when all of a sudden I came across a shop that caught my eye .
In one of the windows I found a skateboard and along came the memories of the year 2000 and MTV channel that I was brought up into .
It was since that day that I try to skate as much as possible and I love every bit of it .
Can use of your own car instead of a public transport save you money , time and effort ?
The most people prefer a car rather than a public transport .
However the latest studies shows a car is not always more efficient .
The right choice of means of transport makes a big impact on your time and resources .
In deciding whether to choose car or public transport we need to consider many factors , such as length of journey , time of the day we travel , area we travel through , number of us , weather etc .
As there are cases where car is much more efficient than public transport and other way round .
The recent studies found , that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient by combining a bike with a train .
It saves plenty of time by avoiding traffic jams and there is no need for searching for a parking space .
In addition travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee .
Moreover there are discounts for regular journeys .
On the other hand , the studies showed , in many other cases and especially in irregular trips there is more convenient to use a car .
It is much more easy to use a car when going shopping , or making a leisure or an occasional trips .
Although , there are some disadvantages of using a car such as traffic jams and a high maintenance cost .
All in all , in most cases using your own car can save you money , time and effort .
Popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , studies said there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable .
Therefore it has a safe place in our society .
However there are those who reject this and are in favour of the use of public transport .
I am going to explain why I think there is not future for the public transport .
A great amount of people think that driving your own car has more benefits than using public transport .
Firstly , it allows you to go directly somewhere without finding out the information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains .
In addition , sometimes you have to combine both of them in order to arrive on time to your work place .
For instance , if you have to go another city by bus or train to your workplace , the time you waste since you set off increases .
Moreover , the use of your own car has more advantages . Travelling by car avoids getting wet when the weather is rainy .
If you travelled by bus or train , probably you would spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination .
Despite the bad weather , if you travellled by car , you could park your car near your destination , so that you could arrive comfortably .
However , there is some people who prefer the use of public transport in spite of using the car .
In addition , it is often claimed that is cheaper than travelling by car .
Although it has some benefits , in most part of the country , especially in the smallest towns the public transport is not enough developed .
To sum up , I believe that the public transport has no future because it makes you to waste a lot of time , it is not enough developed in small areas and there is not enough frequency of trains and buses .
In my opinion it could be useful hardly ever times , so it would be necessary a great amount of improvements .
.H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the need of the people regarding a high number of properties .
First of all , to a certain degree , I comply with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in his grasp , because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family .
This speaks of the idea of the government or another organization having the control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods .
Second of all , as I did say " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling one 's own choices regarding house picking and what they can do with them takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should get to .
Mankind has always strived for freedom in one way or another , and taking away the control of their own house , their sanctuary , will not be taken lightly by them .
In conclusion , I can not tell whether or not the control of the people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only hypothetically speaking , without any form of testing , however it does have its strong and weak points .
First , I want to present myself my name is Daniela and I 'm 16 years old .
I think that I 'm good for this job , because I really sociallize with children .
I 'm a cheerful person so I would attempt to give my best for receiving the attention of the children .
Also I 'm very responsible and hardworking so I would take care of the children and I would do my tasks the best I could .
Eventually , I want to say that this is an important opportunity for me to learn and to do new things .
In this article I am going to write about my favourite sport football .
It 's really fun when we are playing different cups , Gothia for example .
It is worlds biggest youth cup and are located in Gothenburg in Sweden .
Another cup that is Swedens second biggest cup and are called " Piteå Summer Games " and it is shorten to " PSG " .
Both cups are really fun to play , and it 's extremely fun to go far in the cups .
My advice for people that is going to start football is that you just have to do your best .
And try to be a part of the team , then it 's more fun .
And when a football training goes bad , you do n't have to complain so much about it .
Of course you can be angry but it 's not a big deal .
Everyone does wrong sometimes , even the best players in the world .
And at last , it is really fun to play .
well , the part of the day that I enjoy the most is nigth because it 's when I arrive at home and I have finish my whole rutine so I can take a break and I can do whatever I want and I can just relax so I would say that nigth is the most relaxing part of my day so it is the one I prefer the most
Ithink there are things you need to plan because it 's important for your life but it depens on the situation because I also like to let thing be alnd let them happend because they have to happend so the majority of time I prefer not to think about it and just let them happend and not to plan anything but if it 's something related with my future or sometehin that will be really afect me I will prefer to plane it like what kind of job I want to do or about my dregree or things like that
The sports centre in Ondara have visitors of several village and from all age groups .
This centre offer several activities like swimnpool , paddle , tennis , ritmica gym , judo , ballet ...
Furthermore , has various coaches and with a perfect timetable for the parents that are busy the daytime and for young that need to go classes after lessons .
This installation is near the field football and basketball court .
In my point of view it is a good situation because the children can do different after school activities without moving too much .
Moreover , for the parents is easier .
I want to emphasize that thanks to his full schedule and amount of the coaches , adults like children can do different activities at the same time instead to have to wait .
On the other hand , the only disadvantage I can see is there are n't activities for the old people .
This centre should provide activities that do not require much physical effort for this kind of people like petanque or something like that .
Finally to say that is a perfect sports centre and inexpensive including a range of activities .
A friendship that ends , never started
When you are in a hopeless situation they have the right counsel .
I know my best friends since my childhood .
Thomas , David and I were neighbours and grew up in an ordinary calm village .
We spent a huge period of time together .
David is in a boarding school in Bern and conclude next summer .
David looks bored at the first moment but in fact he is wetty .
His body is large and thick like an elephant .
David is always ready for a joke but amazinly that he has the ability to appear seriously .
Thomas is a calmer person and has the control about the circumstances .
When we meet us and the two friends were walking side by side they look like Laurel and Hardly .
I feel really glad to have friends who have time if I have of something .
Especially I like to a first class seat in a plane .
It really feels like you are i a five star Hotel in a luxury suite and not travelling 10000 meters above the ground .
If you need sun and warm weather , you only need to sit in a plane , enjoy your flight and take a pause from your business and from work .
I do n't like to travel by boat , because it 's unconfortable and it takes a fortune till you arrive at your destination .
To travel by train is not an option for me .
I would like to talk about a diamond jewellery set that I gifted to my wife on our last marriage anniversary .
This is a set having one diamond necklace , one diamond pendant with a unique shape , one pair of earrings having diamonds and one ring for her ring finger .
Nowadays it is more common that people spend time to learn another language .
There might be many reasons , for school , business , or just for private interest .
In my personal experience I can say that if you learn a foreign language like English , you wo n't have a problem when I 'll go abroad on holiday .
You might spend time and money to learn a language .
I want to learn English , and I go to the college twice a week .
However , I must pay the fee and every evening it 's my commitment study something or do my homework .
I suggest having all youngsters , who want to learn another language , they ought to go abroad .
The young people should do an experience like this .
I 'm very happy to hear about your news !
If you would like to spend some time travelling my country Spain is a fantastic place , because the weather is good most of the year .
There are beautiful cities to visit like Madrid , Barcelona , Santiago , Valencia and all the cities of Andalucia , the south of Spain .
In Andalucia the people are cheerful and welcoming with tourists .
I , m from Córdoba so i tell you about the most famous sights in my city .
Cordoba is a trhee hours train ride south of Madrid , and draws visitors from all over the world
Córdoba is not as big as Madrid orSevilla but i love it .
The main attraction in Córdoba is the Mosque , it is a building where are mixed arabic and catholic elements .
It is the only Mosque in the world that is not oriented to the Meca .
Out of the Mosque you can see Narrows streets with flowers and a Roman Bridge , it is a wonderful chance to have a relaxing prom .
For a job i recomended you travel to the coast in Cadiz , Malaga or Huelva and look for a job in the beach because at the sime time you are in the beach you could obtain money .
Well , i 's time to go .
The train was running still too fast to jump off and soon it 'll be arrived in Milan central station .
He desperately run through the train towards the driver .
He tried to push the door that led to the head of the engine , but it was locked from the inside .
A cold chill run along his neck .
Then he saw the commander was lying dead in his chair .
He was shot in his head .
In a hurry he dashed to the microphone and answered the control station .
Now in the distance he could see the first skylines of the city .
The train was finally stopped .
That day he came a hero .
He saved 220 people and among them he knew the girl that 5 years later became his wife .
I used to play basketball for three years and it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun .
I enjoyed playing basketball not only because I wanted to play a sport but even because it 's a healthy way of leaving .
If you are playing a sport you improve your abilities went your working in a team in which all the players have the same aim from the game : winning the match .
The advice that I would give the people that would like to start playing this sport is that they should have a bit of experience in working in a team that is full of new people .
The most important thing that ya person should know about this game is that a lot of intelligence is requested because you must know how to reach how to get nearer to make their aim become reality , and that one is that the team should score as much as they can to win the match and have fun .
In my opinion this sport will always be my favourite because it made me feel happy and have a great time with my friends , and it also maintained me in good shape .

To conclude , there are some of an important research principles .
Researchers enjoy their research as an enjoyable activity .
There are two choices to travel : by own car and by pubic transport .
In my opinion , I prefer to travel by car for those reasons .
First , I can travel by my own car whenever and wherever I want .
Sometimes , bus schedule does not suitable for me .
Maybe , bus comes too early or too late for me to go to work .
Second , I feel comfortable when I travel by my own car . I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy .
In rush hours , I do not have a seat and I stand all the time for a half hours .
Furthermore , I do not worry about the theft or any crime which used to happen when I traveled by train .
However , I find traveling by my own car much more advantages than others .
Therefore , I think public transport will be disappeared in the future .
I was so happy when I heard that they are coming to Katowice !
Immediately I contacted their manager , asking If they could do with some help .
She said that they will need someone who can take care of their performance outfits .
Not only I was close to them , I was also doing something I 'm really good at !
Day before the concert , I met band members , and we started try on clothes for the next day .
They turned out to be such a wonderful people , they treated me like an old friend , making jokes all the time and even invited me to eat dinner with them .
On the day of the concert , I met band two hours before start , I ironed all clothes , I even do girls hairstyle .
When the concert hall was full , band came on the stage .
In the headlights , they all looked so beautiful !
I was dancing and singing all show , and after manager came to me and asked if I would like to work with them full time .
You can imagine how great is idea to leave your own car and take a bus to go to work or go shopping .
I 'm glad that every year we have such a wonderful day called " A day without cars " or something like that when people try to use public transport rather that their own cars .
I was absolutely thrilled to read that you 've got a job as tour guide in the Congo rainforest !
I 'm sorry it has taken me so long to write , but I have been working my fingers to the bone preparing for my exams , for which I 'm annoyingly nervous .
At this website , you can find a clear , detailed explanation of the tenses , with illuminating animations .

Hopefully you 're able to visit the site .
I 'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there , you 'll have mastered the tenses the next time we see each other .
Recently works Google , a multi - million dollar company , who is not only famous for search engines on self - driving cars .
Entering your car and giving the directions and then having a stress - free drive towards your destination and let a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore .
But are driverless cars as safe as old fashion cars ?
It takes hours driving to and from , hours where one just have to concentrate on driving , hours gone futile .
On the other hand it will lead to more driving , because smarter driving reduces the cost per mile of vehicle usage .
To put the whole matter in a nutshell the self - driving system is good to prevent accidents .
However you should still be able to drive by yourself you can not only rely on that system it is still not free from errors .
Even thought it is in ruins , visitors from all over the world come to see it .
Today , Not many amphitheaters are standing .
It is in the shape of oval but most of it is broken .
The italian name , Colosseo is quite close to english .
The Colosseum is a quite tall structure .
Come and visit the Colosseum and discover it 's beauty !

Best wishes
many people consider it indispensable .
Like many others , it seems to me that it involve various positive aspects to everyone .
Computers help us in organizing our data , also you can find any information you want very fast as it has lots of search engines .
Another reason , knowing how to use a computer is necessary in most jobs .
A lot computers advertise their goods on the Internet so millions of people would know it - computers enable us to automate various tasks that we can not do manually and that is really helpful .
Computers can help you with your homework to find the information you need .
Finally , in my opinion computers is very useful to all of us .
Everyday , everyhour he found his self thinking about the future .
the job he 'll have , the clothes he 'll wear , the food he 'll cook ... he had almost every inch of his future planned .
But firstly he had to pass the exams .
That was the key to open the treasure trunk , full of golden options .
As his mother he would work as an advocate .
He would make a name for his self working hard , and his family would be proud .
The idea of becoming the people protector face to the law , was n't his .
When he was little , he heard his family talking about how happy they were because his brother Peter waas following the steps of his mom .
Sadly Peter was no longer there .
I have read your hotel 's advertisement about Niagara Fall 's romance package in a newspaper .
First of all , could you provide me information about the whole costs of the package ?
What I am most interested in , is a room with a fall 's view indeed .
Can you assure me of getting one by all means ?
Since I want to spend a night with my partner at your hotel at the end of December , I need a confirmation on your part of providing the room at that time .
In addition , could you provide me information about the nearest airport and about the way to get to your hotel from there ? We must know this for any case since we are going to travel by plane from Budapest , Hungary . I would be pleased if you could assist me in booking a cheap flight as well .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon with all the details which you can provide me .
We live in the century of the speed .
Do I think that public transport will gone in the future ?
One of the reasons is the time .
Now we are spending too much time in waiting for public transport and of course we would like to get our destination as fast as possible , but public transport does n't provide such possibility for us .
That is why we try to buy our personal car .
Furthermore we use personal vehicles or rent cars for travelling , because it is more convenient and gives us the feelings of our independence .
I understand completely that some types of public transport such as airplanes and ships , will exist some time .
But this is an exception because existing technologies do not allow the usage of such personal transport as we would at present day .
I used to helping people when needing , I do n't prefer to be a bystander .
First of all , my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help other .
for instance , one day I was walking in the garden when I saw a girl falling down from a children swing in a playing area , I helped her immediately , after I was sure enough that she was fine , I called her mother and told her about this incident , she thanked me a lot .
I was thinking she was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the same every time .
in addition , young ages are observing an altruistic behavior from month 18th .
for example , last week I was stressed out , so I lost my phone at the university , I was not realizing that until I returned home . while I was on my way to the university , my little sister praying for me to finding out my phone .
so , in my opinion children when they are witness always want to help strangers .
Finally , scientists hypothesize that our brains are helpful enough when we can helping out other people .
How are you?I hope everything is alright .
I 'm writing to say that I 'll be delighted you to be my guest at home next month .
When you get to Barajas airport you 'll have to take the subway and go to Atocha station and there you 'll have to change line and catch line three to get Sol station .
If you 're not for it you can just get a taxi at Barajas airport to the same direction .
Besides this way you can have an exciting start in Madrid .
If you get lost in the metro do n't worry .
AS we know our planet 's condition is getting worse every day .
Because human activity releases into the air substances that damage several things in our planet such as the atmosphere and ecosystems .
The global warming , deforestation and drought are some of the consequences , therefore we can do countless things that appear to be meaningless but if everyone does it we can live in a much healthier planet .
Every day scientists try to develop new ways to improve the way we live , so that we are hable to pollute less the planet .
One of the things discovered by these scientists are the Eco - homes , in other words Eco - homes are a type of homes that help us causing less damage to the planet and atmosphere in our everyday life .
It sounds a little bit strange but by installing solar paniels and other features in these homes we live a much greener life , undoubtedly there would be some changes but because we know why we are doing it there would be no problems .
Also the effects of those actions would be gigantic and would help improve the environment situation nevertheless we will still have to change some activities and be less self - centred so that we can all work for a greater objective .
In my opinion in a decade we will be living in these homes , I ca n't wait to live it
I practise several sports , but my favourite is football .
I play football twice a week as minimum .
Furthermore , football give you the opportunity to make friends because it is a team sport .
With football you can move all the muscles in your body and also exercise your mind thinking about what is the best pass or when you have to run or stop .
If you want to start to play football my advice is to be fit , because if you are n't , you can hurt your bones or muscles .
In order to be fit , you can run or ride a bike for two or three weeks and after that , you are going to be prepared to play football .
So wear comfortable clothes and a good trainers .
I recommend you to play it with your friends , but if you are in a new city , you can search teams on the Internet .
To improve your skills you can practise alone and you will became better than before .
You 're right , in fact it was very difficult to me but I finally took this decision because I want to make new experiences .
I'm very excited!I'm going to the United Kingdom in a week 's time but I 've already made some plans about it .
First of all I 'd love to visit new places .
Would you mind making a list of places you like the most ? .
Moreover I need to organise a tandem to improve my English but if it would n't work I could attend an English course .
Do you know any languages school?They're very expensive so I will need more money .
I have to get money if I want to stay there for half a year !
In the meantime what about helping me to find a part - time job ?
I ca n't definitely get a full - time job 'cause I want to relax and have fun .
I 'm very glad to receive your letter . I 've not heard from you for ages .
There are my answers to your questions .
My favourite museum is the Hermitage that is in the heard of my city .
I think that everybody should visit it because you can see beautiful paintings of gifted and famous artists .
Like to Asia countries , such as : Korea , China , Singapore , the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive to all students , especially for the primary students .
Firstly , the primary education and study system of Vietnam is very hard .
They have to study a lot with from 5 - 6 subjects in a semester .
All subjects are less flexible and all students are learning the same programs at the same time .
Meanwhile , the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system .
The primary students are touch many different life skills by teachers at school .
Additionally , the subjects in the school are given with the aim to develop thinking and creativity of students .
Secondly , it is not only from the school but also Vietnamese parents of the primary students are also expected in the education of their children .
They usually hope that their children get on the highest scores in school .
Therefore , outside the school , Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes , such as : math , writing , grammar , … .
Consequently , Vietnamese children have not any life skills and have many health problems , such as : short - sighted , tummy - ache , spinal column … Sadly , the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short - sighted tend to increase in recent years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents also care about their children but other way with Vietnamese parents .
Outside the school , they send their kids to sport Centre or go to the social activities .
Sum up , Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children . I think that primary students need to spend more time for playing and enjoy their childhood .
I loved to climb from the word go .
My first time was an exciting experience I will never forget : the touch of the rock , the high , the pain in your fingers ... I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive , even sometimes I feel fear .
But do n't think that climbing is a dangerous activity!. Although you climb to the top of a rock wall , you always do it with a checked security material .
You must rely your life on this person , so it 's important you get on with him or her .
Moreover , climbing is a sport in which it 's not too important if you are a man or a woman because you does n't only use your strength but also your equilibration .
You should give a try to this amusing and thrilling sport that it 's a sort of competition with yourself : every day a little bit higher , every day a little bit difficult ..
I love holidays and summer , the season I like best because of a lot of things : In summer I always go to the mountains , in my grandparents ' house , where I get fun with my uncles and cousins .
Grandma 's food is great and I spend days staying outside , playing badminton or volleyball or having a walk in the wood .
Some days we have a long trip too .
We bring food and drinks and we spend a day in beautiful places such as the top of a montain , an amazing castle or a tipical market of a town .
But what I love best are the afternoons with my favourite cousin , Sara , and his brother , Luke .
We play Risiko fou hour : we 're never fed up !
In winter is even better : there 's a lot of snow and we often go skiing on the near peaks : skiing is my favourite sport , I do that since I was five and I love doing the most difficult slops , and Christmas is beautiful with the people I love best .
These are some reasons of why I love mountains and why I spend there most of my holiday .
we were in cold
It is action movie that involves the secret games of CIA .
The film is about this CIA assassin who ca n't remember his past , but he knows he 's chased by the agancy .
Just before the assets get the journalist Jason Bourne helps him to escape .
He tried to get some information from the guy , but unfortunately a sniper shots him dead .
I will not tell you what happens afterwords not to spoil it for you .
It is a piece of work indeed .
If you 'd like to see it I 'm going to come along with you to the cinema , because I really wish to watch it again .
As you know I was really busy last month .
It was so exciting and funny listenig to all those musicians , because some of them actually did n't have the skills to play and did n't have the charm needed to warm up the people .
In the end all went fantastic .
Throughout my life I lived in a few cities and villages located in South of Russia .
Each of the cities has unique set of transportation means .
In villages the only way of public transportation is small buses , most of which can service up to twenty passengers in any moment of time .
In regional centers most people commute via trolleybuses and tramcars .
The latest is transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely lose time in traffic jams due to dedicated railway passages .
Those who are not satisfied with public transportation system may use private vehicles .
Rarely we can see bicycles and scooters .
But recently I bought a cheap bike and really enjoyed riding in summer time .
Now , in November , weather in Russia is not so good so I switched back to buses .
My most recent dream is to ride on EuroVelo roads network .
I expect them to be much more suitable for bikes compared to local roads .
I wish road surface quality in Russia will improve year on year .
Hello my name is Nina Joly and I 'm seventeen .
I still go to high school where I study four languages , French , Spanish , English and Italian .
Thanks to my mom , to travels and to the people I 've met I 've learnt how to speak fearless and quite fluently in English .
I absolutely love children and honestly they love me ; I think it is a sort of a gift , because not all the people love children and can get on well with them .
I 've had a little bit of experience in summer baby sitting some kids ; in Italy it is more diffiult to be a babysitter because if you are underage , parents should have responsibility on you so it is better to be over 18 .
I love playing with kids but as always there are some rules that have to be followed .
During those few times with which I built my experience we all played together and we cooked together , so I taught them how to make some chicken and some pasta in an Italian way .
Honestly I 'm not the best cook ever , but I can make a few good things like scarbled eggs , pasta and meet .
One of my carachteristics is that I 'm a very precise person , for example I enjoy making lists because they make my mind clearer , and I strictly follow what I wrote so everything , hopefully , endes well .
I really like many sports on this world . I go to ge gym daily to stay fit and healthy .
I 'm doing it since I 'm six years old .
It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship to the horse you ride .
With this reliance you can go throughout everything together .
Many people think , it 's not really a sport .
What I like mostly about all the different sections of riding horses is jumping .
I feel so free when I can fly over these obstacles .
Surely this was not everything .
Riding means also to clean the horse and look after it , but nevermind , it 's the best sport you can do .
As the production of cars is increased , it seems that the needs for public transportation is declined .
Some insist that no one need bus or subway in the future .
However , in my opinion , it rather useful to use public vehicles as time goes by based on two critical reasons .
Unfortunately , there is a certain limit to space , so it is not possible that everyone use their car every day especially in mega cities like Seoul , New York , and London .
It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway because you do n't have to worry about your car while working .
Using public means help to protect the Earth from air pollution .
There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes .
The pollution is a kind of global issues of which people should consider seriously .
Without reducing personal vehicles , there is no solution of that problem .
For these reasons , there will be the future for the public transport always .
Moreover , it is quite optimistic that people will need more it rather than private transport .
I am writing to enquire about the job of Camp Assistant in a summer camp , which was advertise in a magazine .
I am 25 years old and I have finished my studies of psicology this year and I am available to work from July to September .
I am a very active person and I am accustomed to doing different kind of sports activities such as swimming and riding .
I consider me a responsible person with the ability to be able to face any kind of problems .
As soon as the languages I speak native Spanish and Catalan and also I speak French and Germany fluenly and recenly I have passed the First certificate in English .
If you think that I am the most suitable person to be recruited , I would interested to hear from you .
This topic leads me to think of professional skill " Architecture design " .
This result in different of views on whether people agree the best things for improvement people 's lives have already taken place .
I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong , even some improvements are easy to use and solves the most of problems .
First , the development of population still continue , the space for living still a serious problem although , the skyscraper already solved the most of problems from population crisis .
On the other hand , the skyscraper makes more problems , such as pollution .
For example , I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan .
The skyscraper provides more space for excess population ; however , the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials , such as steel and concrete .
They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site .
The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials .
This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only transforms to another regions and type .
Second , the computer system looks like solves the most of problems ; however , this system make more dangerous in specific situations .
The " BUG " must be appears from man - made system because of the incomplete coding .
For instance , when we enjoy the electronic commercial service and shop the goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal the private information at the same time .
They will use that information to cheat people 's money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information .
This is normal phenomenon in Taiwan ; however , police ca n't do anything because of the hacker 's anonymity .
That is what I said that the best improvement things still not exist , even the computer system already solved some problems .
That being said , I still feel the reasons I have presented was strong ones , such as architecture and computer system .
As soon as I read the article about your problem , I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions , since I have the similar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongly that the daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be on shape .
To start with , a simple way to work out is not to get the bus for school .
For example , you could go on foot or with your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead.by doing this , you will burn more and more calories daily without a special equipment and having fun with your pals .
Furthermore , if I were you , I would go with engaging in healh club .
For instance , signing up for hip - hop dance or aerobic classes as I do , it would be a nice idea .
In this way , you will do a hard - working exercise without realising it , as you will enjoy yourself at the same time .
What is more , it could help if you work out at home and buy gym equipment such as treadmill or a bicycle .
By doing the chores of the house like the washing is another way to exercise as well .
To sum up , if you follow my options you 'll see results directly and I 'm sure you will not regret it .
You will not feel self - confident and glad , but your outward appearance wiil be better .
Plenty of ways can be used to make new friends .
Facebook , Twitter … all of these social networks offer us the easiest way to find new friends .
In my opinion the best way to develop your new friendship is , meeting them , have a coffee a drink or whatever .
Talking is truly the unique way to get to know people and establish strong bound .
Moreover , some guys try to find friends who always agree with them .
To tell you frankly a best friend has to offer you a different point of view and what is more it is important say no sometimes .
For all of these reasons we have to take care our friendship theses days and social networks are ok to be in touch with your friends but if you wo n't to make new ones .
Go anywhere !
And meet new people .
At the age of eighteen , most of British students are finishing secondary school .
A new , tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for collage or to embark on their professional career .
The family financial support , at this stage , seems almost essential .
With this in mind , some questions arise : Should young people be given all money easily or should they put in a great deal of effort to get it ?
We have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this juvenile generation .
Because they are so , and there is no trouble with that .
The more they sweat to chase their dreams , the fast they ripen and prize what they earn .
What I 'm doing is challenging the way we approach to it .
We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time we help the next generations to succeed by their own means .
If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid they grow lazy , then economic relief is welcomed .
Undoubtedly , I 'm presenting a major challenge to every parent : shall we be able to take care for youngsters provision and yet teach them that money does n't grow on trees ?
Money is almost essential , but the way young people learn to interact with this is essential to shape a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort .
My holidays was here !
I arrived to Spain on Sunday morning , It was a lovely sunny day in Malaga .
I arrived very exahusted , because I could't sleep the night before .
I had to wait awake in the airport !
When I arrived at home , I just wondered one thing , sleep , so I did .
I was sleeping all the afternoon .
Monday , I had the typical " family day " , I had been eating with all my family in our cottage .
I was all the day liying in the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredibly time with them .
I was all the day at home with my cat watching English film and eating Spanish desert .
In Andalusia , in Easter , the typical desert it 's called " pestiño " .
It a sweet olive oil pastry with honey .
My mum was preparing the day before , and was really yummy .
I almost eat it all !
My family is catholic so in Easter , the main days for our religion are Thursday and Friday , for my family too .
I 'm catholic , I believe in God but I 'm not very friendly with the Vaticano 's rules .
I 'm a free catholic .
Probably it sounds weird , but I 'm on my way .
These two day were family days , I had to go to the church to a mess which represent the last alive days from Jesuschrist : the last dinner and the passion .
At least , these weekend I did n't do anything in special , because I feel tired and I had n't got money enough to do any special plan .
Finally , the day to comes to England had arrived .
Monday I came back to London and my holidays had finished .
In my opinion public transport is the future , because its quality and comfort will improve and it 'll be easier to move and cheaper too .
Travelling by car is so much more conveniente if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
Imagine to go by car to cities like London , is it the car more convenient ?
If you consider the cahotic traffic and the long queues to get there and impact of these factores on people 's health and people 's finances , I 'm sure you 'll change your mind about public transport .
In the last few years public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology , flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables , tickets and places .
Besides these , the public transport is better for the environment , especially the electric bus .
On the other hand , is possible to find hibrid cars but they are more expensive than those that works with normal fuel and for that reason people 's first option is not this kind of car .
The theme of environment is very important nowadays and can cost a lot to a country .
A country has to pay for their ecological foot and this means as much pollution is produced more environment damage , in other words bigger ecological foot , and consequently more has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental stategies in order to decrease the costs of ecological foot .
Such strategies will involve taxes above poluent cars , the increase of fuel price and definition of benefits to those who opts for more environmental means of transport .
So the convenience of travelling by car is not totally true .
Of course you are owner of your time and destinations , but it is enough ?
Think about its impact on your espences and on the environment , would n't be better to take a bus , an underground or a train ?
If we consider all the factors mentioned above , probably much people will change their mind .
I am Ana Alicea Benavidez , a student from the Faculty of Medicine of Málaga , where a girl , who was one of your volunteer , was talking about this project the last week , she suggested we to join it .
I have working in different activities like this , for example in a famous basketball team as a volunteer , or in the hospital with children and their parents who live there .
Moreover , I live alone in my home , therefore I can cook and be an excellent cooker too .
I consider I am a fun , communicative and responsible person with experience in this kind of activities , and who can help in all the things you need .
Because of that , I think that I could take part in your team and I would be a suitable person for you .
Finally , I would like to know where will be the camps exactly because I need to buy the flights .
These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading across mankind 's history .
Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea , this article focuses about the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain .
First of all , the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimulus .
Those kinds of stimulus come from several sources and they help you in different measures to exercise the brain .
However , reading is the most important source to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind .
Those kinds of things help to the brain to be more active and process information faster .
At second , there are some researches that prove that in general people who read are smarter than people who do not .
This affirmation is based in the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain reading books .
This is another big reason to take care about reading , because in this competitive world , only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society .
At third , when people read , they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what 's going on .
That situation is another example of how reading is an excellent brain 's exercise , because when people have to imagine things , the brain has to be creative , and that kind of process is too important to improve yourself in problem 's resolution and creation of important ideas in real life .
In general all the things described before show how important is reading to exercise the brain .
So , next time when you try to avoid a book , think first whether you need that your brain works faster or be more creative , because could be a good idea to exercise a little bit your brain with reading .
There are many good movies , especially thrillers are always enjoyable in my opinion .
First I was really impressed by the performance of Jodi Foster ( Clarice ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
Not only in their individual parts , but also in the scenes they did together .
Secondly , the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and for that really enjoyable .
On top of that was there tension at all times .
This movie is outstanding , I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it .
As I mentioned before , are both the acting and the storyline really impressive .
At last is the character of Hannibal Lecter one of a kind , there is no other movie where you will find a figure like him .
How 's your first English literature lesson at school ? I hope it had loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired !
I had learnt the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London as well as the lifetime of William Shakespeare .
You may have thought theatres would be fashionable place for the royalty , courtiers and merchants .
However , it was not .
As it cost very little to get into an open - aired theatre , everyone jammed and jostled to watch plays , though the poor stood under bright sunshine and had their heads burnt while the rich sat in the shelter with an extra shilling paid .
At that time , males had to work while the female were forced to stay at home and do all the household chores .
These actors paid full attention to convenience the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting .
What a gargantuan sacrifice of self - esteem and reputation they had given up !
One more interesting fact is that , both the lovers in the play were Italians but their playwright had never been to Italy .
It could reflect 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in touch Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors .
Three trumpet blasts were given symbolizing the start of play , yet none of the respected silence would be given .
Audience would boo and throw fruits to the actors in case they did n't like them .
Special dramatic effects were thus added on stage .
Cannonballs were rolled around to make sound of thunder .
Pig 's blood was used during casualties or deaths in sword fighting .
In a roofed - in theatre , pulleys and machinery were used for lowering actors on stage .
Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter , romance , and tragidies .
The play lover , King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men .
The company changed its name into ' the King 's Men ' and performed over 200 plays !
By now , I have widened my horizons and increased my interest towards the spotlight on playhouses .
I wish you love it either !
As you asked I am going to give the information of how my village looks after the environment .
My village has been working on this project for decades they have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort we started from the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an area where its population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human 's activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when referring to taking care of the environment .
The principal things everyone must have at their houses are three trash can for the division of the trash ; one must be for renewable materials ( rest of food , paper , carton … ) another for plastics and the last one for glass .
All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy , that provide part of the energy to each house the days that the sun shines but if there is no sun the village has a dam beside us which provides them enough with water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only we have hydraulic energy but also wind energy ; in the out skirts of the village there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .
Also our water has one of the best purification methods after we use it we clean it so we do n't contaminate the water of the river or dam .
To try to keep the environment clean we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking all the rubbish and controlling the whole area in case there is something not normal .
Apart from this group of voluntaries every person of the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as minimum as possible here the bicycle is the most famous way of transport car are n't common they are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances .
Nowadays , many people like do the shopping .
But everyone think in that way ?
Some of them think that buying things are very boring and unnecessary .
First advantage of buying new things in shops is that it is very satisfying , in particular for women .
Secondly , we could find shocking bargain in shops .
Shops could give us even 70 percent of sale , what helps saving more money .
On the other hand , doing the shopping is not only something enjoyable .
One of the drawback of going to the shop is that we spend huge amount of money .
We would buy next , impracticable high - heel shoes , which will spend couple of years in wordrobe .
Last but not least disadvantage against for doing the shopping , in the mall could prowl many pickpokets , because they could rob us .
In conclusion , buying new things is a good idea to spend fascinating time with friends , however we could also lose a lot of money .
Personally , I do not agree with the statement " shopping is not always enjoyable " , because I like this kind of spending leisure time , for instant , with my mom or friends .
Therefore it compares the purchase price , the warranty expenses and the running costs of each product .
Interestingly the pruchase price of " Carde " and " KD " is almost the same .
In " Cardas " case the amount is $ 600 and " KDs " price is vagualy $ 700 .
However " Sebu " rocks with a pruchase price of $ 1,000 .
All photocopiers show a very low warranty price .
In this category " KD " exeeds with cost of $ 200 .
Wherby " Carda " and " Sebu " score with warrnty expenses under $ 150 .
" Cada"s product has the highest running costs with $ 1,200 .
In the case of " KD " the running charges come only up to $ 800 and " Sebu " has obviously the lowest expenses with $ 600 .
As a long term investion I would choose " Sebus " model even its purchase price is very high .
The reason therefore are its small warranty and especially running costs .
The kenn running expenses will compensate the purchase price in the future .
In today 's world , nearly every person take care of what she or he is wearing .
Many people claim , that wearing fashionable clothes is very important .
It seems to me that these clothes may have a high price and sometimes they do not worth it .
Some people fear if they do not wear the latest fashion , they wo n't be valuable person .
They spend a fortune on outfits and wait for being admired and appreciated .
Wearing any kind of clothes have an effect on you , and obviously on your image .
I agree with the idea that clothes can help in expressing ourselves .
For example , some people design their own clothes and they sew it too .
However , in most causes people are not satisfied with their shape and look .
It is often owing to wearing clothes which do not fit and suit them .
The latest fashion is often designed for slim persons , so it is recommend to choose the right ones .
To sum up , I believe there are pros and cons wearing the latest fashion .
It 's inside that count .
He ran over to his treehouse on the mountain , where he used to spend time himself or reading a book .
Two days before Peter received a letter of someone saying to meet her / him in the treehouse at 5 o'clock .
Two years ago , Peter 's father died so Peter was the only one that knew where was the treehouse .
Peter ran and ran and when he arrived he saw the door opened .
He founded it strange because he always lock the door and the only people that had the keys was he and his father .
He came into the house and saw a man sitting on his father 's chair .
He shout " Who 's there ? " and suddenly the man turned over and the mystery man was Peter 's father and he said " I 'm proud that you have kept our secret .
Peter ran into his father 's arms but he disappeared and he promised himself that he never ever would tell anyone about the secret .
I do not think that no future for public transport because not all the people can have a car , especially , poor people in the developing country .
Moreover , there are places on long distance we can not travel by car , so we need a train or even a plane .
In addition , some people do not like travelling by their private cars on the highways because they fear the accidents .
But on the other hand , l agree to some extent that travelling by my private car is much more convenient .
I can travel at any time being restricted to specific times , as well as l can rest at any cafe to drink my favorite coffee .
I enjoy using GPS during travelling on my own to explore new places .
Consequently , we can not dispense with public transport , even if some of us would rather to use their private cars .
Some non - building areas , in some countries , are now occupying by housing and other residential buildings .
This would have some serious problems for both citizens and animals .
Human beings need more natural environment to live better and to ensure the living qualities .
Inhabits can go to countryside to have a pacnic or excursion with their friends or families to relax .
Ater natural areas , such as farmland , forest and wetland , are destroyed in large - scale , there is no close places with beautiful scenes to visit .
The consequence is that they are easily to get sick with modern buildings , which would influence their mental health , and even worse .
For animals , they are a part of nature , where is the home for them .
Without a pleasant place to live in , they are confronting extinction .
If their living areas are occupied by housing and other buildings , their source of food and water could be a serious problem .
As a result , some most vulnerable species will face to die out .
The large - scale building land are supporsed to be their home .
For governments , restriction on exploring human land is one of the ways to solve these problems .
Policmakers can enact a law in reducing land development .
Another method is that natural ecology gardens can be provided to those animals , like birds .
As long as there are some places for them to live , the natural ecology could be balanced .
Governments are responsible for changing this problems to achieve the harmony between man , nature and animals .

She had a feeling that her birthday wo n't be oridinary .
For sure her friends were preparing a big surprise .
As far as she considered , she find out that she had a right .
Firstly , just after she had went into the school they greeted her with million colofull balloons with inscriptions with all the best wishes .
Then she had to go for class so every balloon was sent to the sky what made a beautiful view .
Eventually they came to the lake on the suburbs and then she saw something unexceptable .
There was a big surprice - party in the forest .
Firstly she noticed only a big tranparent with a title " Happy birthday Anna ! "
She heard the music and this is how the party stared .
It was really amazing day full of pleasures .
In my point of view I recommend you to stop going to sport classes , because I think music classes are better because you can also get a job in a orchesta or something like that .
Also you can work such an athletic and you can obtain a big amount of money but it 's also so difficult to get there and you have to be the best of them to earn a good amount of money .
So yes , I recommend you to carry on with your music classes but if you prefer to do sports I will support you also .
I do n't know which of them you like more but I am sure that you like one more than the other , so if you want to be a basketball player do n't give up with it .
I recommend you more the music classes but that 's your choice .
So that was my opinion about your problem and my recommendation but you are the one that have to take a decision , so good luck and remember to study also .

This study project will be developed studying
-Danish and European historic documents and previous research about the Euro ;
-Danish and European Institutions such as ECB , European Commission , Danish Ministry of Economy and Foreign Affairs , and it will be necessary to make and analyse interviews to Danish and European politicians , economists and experts of this historic and economic field .
To ensure safety wearing safety shoes is the most basic measure .
For example , in the electro - pneumatic control training course , the operator must wear face mask when the machine is on to protect from hitting by the tube with high pressure air , likewise , it is also a necessary measure to start the machine after you are fully prepared with a face mask .
And the PLC controller 's wires have been protected by the insulated rubber everywhere except the connection point .
In addition , when operating the variable frequency drive ( VFD ) , it is necessary to set another separate emergency stop button , which is easy to be make out for unprofessional people in case of emergency .

Ever since a curse was put opon Ailee 's grandmother , the girl has been living a daunting life .
A life , being unseen to humans eyes .
It was the curse that had made her life living next to the humans tough .

It was the story about black maids who worked for white families during 1960 's .
The movie was stoning , some of the plots were rather shocking .
It is hard to believe during the segregation time , black people were treated as a second - class citizen not only in real life but also in the constitution law .
The movie revealed the ironic reality and the ignorance and stupidity of some unkind people during the segregation time .
Before I moved to Canada .
Now from books , movies , I knew some of the most influence movements , I know Martin Luther King , Jr. was more than an activist and a public speaking man .
I knew the first person who ended the segregation at southern was a 9-year old girl .
It 's hard to imagine what they had been through during the civil rights movements .
It 's hard to put myself into their boat .
What if I was an African- American , what if I was born during the segregation time .
As if I can not imagine if I were a heroin of one of the enormous heroic stories .
What would I do for my county .
I was born and raised in China , being a Chinese , it is our obligation to remember what Japanese soldiers had done to us during World War II .
We learned enormous heroic stories about how those heros scarified their lives for victory .
I have no idea why we had to learn those legends which were full of darkness , torture and violences .
It was the first day of Max 's School excursion to the Patagonia , they had arrive there yesterrday night but , today was the day they would actually go exploring .
They left early in the morning , everyone in the trip was very excited .
As soon as they got to the base of the mountain trail everyone filled up their water bottle and began walking .
Max was so anxiuos to see all the different kinds of wildlife .
Halfway through the trip Max heard a wierd noise close by and he decided to see what was going on , but before he knew it he was all alone .
The noise continued so he decided to see what was happening , As he turned the corner he found himself looking at a puma that was badly injured .
Max did nt know what to do .
He followed the trail until final he was able to catch up to the class .
He went to the guide and told him about what he saw .
The guide decided to go with Max to the see the puma for himself .
When they got to the loction the guide decided to call the wildlife protection in that area to come help .
Once the wildlife protection were able to help the puma , everyone congratulated Max for his bravery and help .
Max coud not be happier . "
What and amazing day!",Max whispered to himself as he into bed that night .
The last documentary I saw was a documentary of National Geographic called Ocean .
It was about the life in the ocean and the consequences of climate change .
So overall I would recommend this documentary to everybody because all the people must know what we are doing with the Earth and they must learn to look after it because we only have one Earth and if we destroy it , we wo n't have any place where we can live .
I conduct group and individual training on Hatha Yoga and Thai Yoga ( Ruesi Dat Ton ) .
All my yoga lessons and massage sessions are conducted in line with Correct Approach to Spine ( CAS ) method , so they are very safe and based on scientific reason .
Safety and knowledge of the body mechanic are very important to CAS vision as they give feeling of confidence and understanding to yoga practitioners .
I had practised Ashtanga and Iyengar 's styles of yoga and Ruesi Dat Ton ( yoga of Thai hermits ) , learned different approaches during my training in India and Thailand , and my practice brought me to Classical Yoga - Correct Approach to Spine school , which way of exersising I found the safest , the most beneficial for health and scientifically grounded .
Because for me the practitioner 's safety is the one of the most important thing as ahimsa ( non harm ) is one of the crucial principles of yoga .
Thank you for your circular in which you explained your plans with the Warden Park .
My husband and I appreciated very much that you are receptive to new ideas .
The swimming pool is the favourite spot for building our condition .
Can you imagine that we were a bit disappointed when we read your plans to build a second sauna cabin beside the swimming bath ?
For them ( or do I have to admit us ) , it should be a better idea to build a changing room with more space at that particular place .
In addition , your proposal to provide additional equipment for the gym and a wide screen TV for the snack bar did not get applause in our home .
My recommend : do not hesitate to invest in a second microwave .
My last , but not least , advice is for the gym .
Maybe you can consider a bit renewing there with new classes , such as kickboxing .
Thank you once again that we were allowed to give our suggestions for you wonderful place .
If you ever do need more of these proposals , you can reckon us !

He loves searching the net .
As many young people , Michael lives with email , Whatsapp , Facebook and something like that .
Two weeks ago he knew a beautiful girl in Linkedin .
She seemed a foreign student in Palmira , in the north of Siria .
At certain moment , the girl , named Cris , asked him for a little aid .
She said it was a present for his aunt , who lives in Casablanca .
Michael went to take the case .
He took the case and planned to travel to Casablanca next weekend , taking advantage of a bank holiday on Monday .
He entered the office to control the luggage .
A civil servant called him to go to a next room to speak with him .
A few days ago , Tom saw on the newspaper an article that talked about the pollution that is produced by the cars and the effects that they would have in a few years .
This would cause a global warming causing the winter disappearance .
The same day he asked to his Science teacher if this would probably happen on a future .
The Science teacher explained to Tom all the problems that would provoke the global warming an he propose to Tom to do a campaign to raise about the use of the cars and the problems that would cause on a future .
To promote the campaign , Tom went to speak with the director and they put in agreement that all the kids of the school did a few placards with inspiring phrases to not use so much the cars and uses more public transport .
When Tom has arrived home , he has explained to their parents all related to the campaign and they have been very happy
It had been a very long day and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
I come from Sestri Levante , a small town near Genoa , on the north of Italy .
I live just in front of the sea and I 've been working in restaurants and pubs since I was 16 , where I learned cooking and serving tables .
I am the eldest of four brothers and sisters and I have been used to take care of them , when my parents were at work , especially because I love babysitting !
I attach my English C.V. so you can read my references and my past experiences .
Home of the future will be definitely different from those in which we live currently .
Maybe the shape of homes will not change as much , as the internal .
For sure the main role in every home will play technology .
Everything will be working remotely , lightning , heating - probably there will be a possibility to programme everything by time , day , month and so on .
Doors will open by our voice , footprint or retina scan .
Room configuration and style will be somewhat different - more glazing , more open spaces .
The decor will be more modern and simpler .
The dominate colour will be white , but there will be some elements in more vivid colours .
Main materials will be plastic and metal .
Unfortunately we ca n't know that for one hundred percent .
We 'll see with ours own eyes in twenty , maybe fifty years .
One year ago Robert Stromerg directed " Maleficent " , from the film " Sleeping beauty " .
The cast included Anegelina Jolie as Maleficen , Elle Fanning as Princess Aurora , Sharlto Copley as King Stefan and Sam riley as Diaval .

After taht Aurora does n't wake up .
Maleficent is sad and she does apologies and she kisses Aurora .
Finally Maleficent overpowers Stefan .
At the end Aurora lives with Maleficent in the magic forest .
As I think , learning likes a weapon for any individual which enables him to be like a champion .
Learning has no end , We spend all of our lives learn from circumstances we face .
Learning not only means to study in schools , universities , etc .
But it means to improve your skills , your talents .
You can use it to learn any language or take courses in any field from your home during weeks or months as you can , which named self - study .
Always remember that , " Education is what remains after one has forgotten what he has learned in school " Albert Einstein said .
This composition is about the famous person from my country .
I choose this man because he was a significant player during the slave trade .
The Gambia is visited by many tourist because of him .
This has led to many black Americans to visit the Gambia for investment purposes .
He can across the slave master in the mouth of the river Gambia while looking for his friend .
Kunta was sold to slave master in South America .
He works very had in the sugar plantation for the slave master .
While in capture , he fought the rights of all the black slaves in the campus .
He was refused with food but he kept going with his strike .
He was later given the opportunity to learn English language .
He attends the same class with other relatives of the slave masters .
He was famous and respectful in the slave Campus .
He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolishment of slavery .
But his name was written by all western nation newspaper as the brave man .
Because of his efforts that lead to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom for captured slave in the campus .
The Gambia is well known by the adventurers and the tourist .
The stature of Kinta is situated in the entrance of Banjul .
Kunta was not only a great man in the Gambia but a hero .
Public transport is a public medium to bring people from one place to another .
In this era , there are many types of public transport using by people , for example : bus , train , monorail , light - rail - transit ( LRT ) , taxi , and so on .
Most people using a public transport to go to their workplace and travelling around the city .
Some of the workers choosing to use public transport than their own cars .
This is because they want to avoid the traffic block .
Mostly , they are more preferring to use public transport than the car because it can avoid the traffic block and save time to get into their workplace earlier .
It is also can save the money as the price of the ticket of public transport is cheaper compared to oil cost by using the car .
Through all of these points , it is not faulty to say that is the public transport still available and very useful in our daily life , even there are a lot types of cars , which are more convenient .
so , there will be a future for public transport because of its own benefits or advantages to human society .
It is very friendly transportation where the people from all places , meet in one transport and they can make a relationship between them .
Additionally , the pollution , such as haze , will be decreased because fewer people using the car .
As a conclusion , there is a future for public transport and it also convenient to use it for travelling .
We will not have to worry about where to find a park for the car and we can enjoy the trip .

I have the pleasure to give this essay to Ms .
It offers a delicious Egyptian menu which provides enough dishes to cover all tastes , as an example , their delicious fresh eggplant traditional salad .
If there is anything that favors this restaurant , it has to be the quantity they serve ; a surely efficient quantity along the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town , if not in the whole country .
What about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer ; with a soulful live band and an elegant dining set , their atmosphere adds up to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit ht whole class , professionally named , the meeting table .
This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons ; firstly it offers a traditional menu which will ensure to cover all different tastes .
Secondly , the lively atmosphere it offers will surely keep the class entertained during the entire dine - in .
At the end of my essay , I would like to devote this paragraph and thank my wonderful teacher for this opportunistic chance to offer my sincere opinion on the topic .
Many thanks and I hope for a wonderful trip regardless of the restaurant voted for .
My first day at ACU came to me as a surprise .
Although it was not easy to get used to such teaching style , it did not take long for me to realise what teachers were expecting from us and why they were doing so .
Participation in class by asking and answering to questions demands more active thinking from us .
Nobody would argue the significance and effectiveness of modern technology , having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable virtues , such as massproduction , information and communication devices as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs .
However , it has also posed some alarming issues , namely environmental destruction , and increasing unemployment and health concerns .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhanced individuals'quality of lives , controbuting to the economic growth of numerous nations .
To illustrate , machineries and the use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop massproduction and raise the availability and quantity of various types of food , having made them cheaper and more affordable .
I believe many of us do not have a faintest idea about this sport .
It is played in a box drawn on the ground in the size of a volleyball court .
A centre line parts the box and a line is drawn inside each box about 2 feet from the line which ends the box , and this line is called proudly as Ellai kodu(Border Line)in Tamil .
Rules of engagement are quite simple .
The first and most important rule is you do not let the opponent player who raids your field(the box)to touch your border(Border Line).The second rule is You do not let the opponent to cross over the ' No men 's land'(The centre line),when the opponent touches the Border of your's .
The opponent must raise a leg when the other one touches the border to tell them " Lo , I am in your territory".If the opponent touches the border , he can retreat to his field , no shame in that , but he do n't get any points .
But before retreating , if he touches anyone among them and leaves their field without getting caught , then The raider gets a point and the person who was touched by the raider is dead(Out ) .
Each team gets opportunity to raid other 's field alternatively , and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin , as usual as in most games .
A number is decided to count the dead ones and which team reaches that number first loses the game to the another .
Rules are pretty simple but the game is quite tough , you'll hurt yourself really bad .
Why on earth do they love slits , scratches and scars!Are they sick ?
One can wonder , but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature , written circa 300 BCE .
It says the bravery of men is reckoned by the number of scars on his body except on his back , because they thought to be dead in the field is far better than retreating .
There are accounts to say about a woman who cut her breast because she found her son 's body pierced by a long narrow spear - like weapon in his back rather in the chest .
So I like this game because it reflects the Tamil culture 's important value which is giving high rank to bravery .
no exams or wedding or the first day of school ,
one of my most ecxiting day of my life was the 23rd august 2014 .
it can be very strange but i was very exited , because ,
on this date the BBC released the new series of Doctor who ...
It is a popular English science fiction and it tales about the adventures of the " Doctor " .
the Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and he travels in all of time and space with his companions that are normally humans . in his experiences he saved whole planets to other bad aliens .
I think Doctor Who is totally different from other science fiction films , it always has done the unthinkable , the impossible , things that no one else has even dreamed of .
I like Doctor Who very much . I always dream to travel everywhere in time and space since I was a little child ! ! !
! if,(one day)I will have the possibilty to do it I will go to distant galaxies and I will see how the universe began .
in my opinion this serie was wonderful and , i hope for the next one !
Hi chi Tình ,

We recommend you to consider the electronic content available through these library subject guides
My apology for any frustration you may have .
The big question was if she would have been able to engage herself in this new activity .
She was trying to improve her English skills since September by taking an English course , but she had felt herself still unready to keep a whole math topic using this language with the Clil method , because she was placed to the B2 level in reading and listening while in speaking and writing the level she had joined doing a specific test was only the B1 .
After thinking a lot about the positives and negatives aspects of this question , refers also to the quality of hers teaching methods and the time she had to spend preparing the math topics in English , Emily decided to accept the challenge and to engage herself in this new adventure .
In The Home of the Future everybody will segregate waste and take care of environment .
People will have the device that extinguish the light when we leave the room .
We will have furniture that do not stain .
We also discover flowers that irrigate themselves and machine that walk a dog or wash them when we do not have enough time to do this .
Kitchen will be different too .
We will have equipment that will prepare meals for us with only one pressing a button .
Then we wo n't dream about great , Italian spaghetti because our stove will do it better than every Italian cook .
That is the kind of house that I want to resident in twenty years .
The answer on this question depends on the fact in which place you live .
If the place of your happy living is relatively large city , you will say indeed : " We obviously need public transport ! Everyone knows what happens on the streets in rush time ?
You can get stuck in traffic jam for hours ! " .
It seems that if people did not move yourself only in their beautiful cars and take a bus or metro , the air would be clearer , the city would become less noisily etc .
On the other hand , if you live in a small town or village , your answer is : " Of course , I prefer my own car or bicycle to public transport , if I do n't go far away .
I have more ideas where to travel by car , as public transport 's routes are "
On your attitude to public transportation highly affects the quality of public transport itself .
I mean a timetable punktuality , time interval to tne next bus and so on .
At last , how big the crowd are in the bus or subway car in rush time , how convenient for yourself to be there , rather than sitting in your own air - conditioned and perfect looking car .
I was always fascinated by this American tradition to make a resolution list .
It was something new to me and that 's why attracted me so much .
The idea of writing a blog triggeredmy mind as well .
As my sister constantly says You 're lucky because you have a memory of a goldfish You remember absolutely nothing .
It took me much to admit this again fact .
In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory ) I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures .
A year ago an idea of beginning a blog encountered me as advice from an English teacher .
Maybe it 's really time to make a resolution and do begin writing it .
I 'm going to kill two birds with one stone - my blog will help me to collect my memories and master my English The third bird will be my hatred to writing .
I hate writing since school .
Such tasks made my family busy for an evening and anyway I always had a poor mark .
So my dear blog ( I heard it 's the way I have to interact with it ) You will be about nothing .
good
She : I decided my blog will be about nothing .
He : lol I think I will win :P you wo n't be able to write about nothing for very long :)
I have so much nothing in my head to write about

No one can tell how it will be like .
The cosmic era , communications , easy access to the Internet - all of these things will become common in the distant future .
According to these changes people will change , their way of life will as well .
People will start purchasing all the items from the Internet .
New methods of transportation may speed up the delivery to the purchaser home and , as a result , it will improve the quality of service .
The new communication networks will transform the whole world into the big village where everyone will be able to make contact any person .
The development of the space technologies and companies connected to construction of the spacecraft may give a start to space tourism .
The Earth orbit , the Moon , maybe Mars - all will be much closer to mankind and there will be another great leap for it .
I hope I will see such future .
I hope it will be real for me to see how humans will land on Mars , how this will become popular .
I believe that the public transport does n't have future because travelling by car is so much more convenient and comfortable .
When you travel in your own car you do n't have to wait a specific time and you can go somewhere but when you travel in public transport you must wait to the time when the public transport could catch you .
In public transport you must go to the points in the route .
The seats are more comfortable in a car than in a bus or underground .
That 's why I prefer Travelling by car instead of public transport .
I am very glad to read this good news , it is the first step for the final result and I will try to do my best to give you useful information for your interview .
It opened more than twenty years ago and still now is the leader of chimical sector .
The day of the event dress not to formal but also not to informal .

When you come here send me a text .

Recently I have seen " Prisoners " , a great thriller .
This film is about a kidnapping of two little girls .
Everyone in the village try to find the children .
The man is really frightened and this situation gets him more and more desperate and he can not control his reactions .
I enjoyed this film a lot because it attracts your attention all the time .
In my opinion it is so really exciting because you are constantly thinking where the girls are or who can be the kidnaper .
I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller , this thriller is the correct one .
However , there is a problem and it is that the film shows much violence and it should not be seen by children , only by teenagers or older people .
At any case , in my opinion it is a great film which many people would enjoy if they see it .
As the way I see it , to find the origin of languages can be similar to know our own family tree .
Because that can give us a lot of new information about us that we did n't know .
On the one hand it can be funny to imagine and create the story of how everything happened formerly .
But on the other hand , we can have too much imagination and to be disappointed with the truth .
That always depends on what we were expecting for .
In my opinion , there are so many things we have to discover yet , and much more we left back as we progress .
Consequently , it will be a constantly research on the field of our origins .
Well , it keeps my fit , but not my body in the first case , it 's good for my brain .
I play Skat .
There are so many opportunities which card to lay and which colour is trump .
I know a builder who plays very well and a professor who - mh - so to speak - still needs some more practice .
I also teach childring at the age of 10 or 11 how to play it .
My husband and me play in two clubs .
and of course , people play Skat in pubs and win some chops of meat .
I really ca n't understand why chess is considered to be sport and Skat is n't .
When it comes to helping communities , people hold different attitudes toward whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities or not .
Some people think young people spend enough time to help their communities ; however , others disagree with the idea .
Actually , there are many communities still do not receive enough help , or many social issues and events would not be discussed again and again .
Many reasons result in this phenomenon .
The world becomes more and more competitive , young people have to spend much time to cultivate themselves to survive in this society .
Young people are not only have to spend much time to make them be professional in one specific subject , they also have to know a wide range of knowledge .
For example , to be outstanding to enter to the best university , student have to perform well on their curriculum , such as literature and science , they also have to be good at music or doing exercise .
To survive in the era of inflation of price , young people have to get more than one jobs .
They have to do full time job at day time , and have a part time job at night .
To sum up , the world nowadays makes young people to survive by themselves , and they do spend much time to help others .
The Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rather thorny .
While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the Thespian art to flourish in England , in Russia was very dim and sinister period of Ivan IV the Terrible 's reign .
So , in Russian print the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748 .
First translations appear in the end of 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actually because they are made from German or French and the translators change plots as they want ( and turn them into some tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia in a meantime appears to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet torture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is close to unbelievable , but at first critics and educated people find Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and narrow - minded people !
Once more into the breach ! ) .
But everything changes quite rapidly then .
The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original is published in 1828 .
By 1855 only six plays has left non - translated .
It comes to fashion and becomes honorable to translate Shakespeare .
Russian society gradually begins appreciating Shakespeare 's skill in portraying greatness , depth , and complexity of a human being .
" The sun of Russian poetry " , Alexander Pushkin takes his English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare .
In the poetical drama Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov we clearly read Othello 's features .
And these are like nodes on the tree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Since that time Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists .
We love his simplicity and veracity , we adore his multiplicity and fantasy , we appreciate his straightness and audacity , we prize his delicacy and his funny bone of course !
First , I want to explain to you what happened to me on Saturday morning . I had to meet up with my friend Matus at 14 am when he told me that he could n't come over that if we could meet up later how you can understand he made me so angry because I ca n't put up this kind of person who who is in late always .
On Saturday morning I had to working and I had to do all the things as fast as was possible to be in the city centre at the exact time .
The worst part of story was when he told me that he was going to have a lunch with his friends .
I got cold feet I could n't understand what was happening .
I was supposed to we were going to have a lunch together but he was going to come later .
Despite all I tried to calm myself down and I went to the library until laura came to town .
Finally yesterday at night , I was studying in my room when the doorbell rang I went to opened the door and outside was , my friend Matus .
This fact took me by surprise .
He wanted to explain to me what was the problem .
At the beginning I did n't want to talk with him but on second thought all people deserve a second chance .
All in all , He apologized and at the end everything is solved
We go on being friends .
The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Católica number 30 , suburb Centro Historico in Mexico City .
Azul Historico is a different restaurant and is located in a patio of an old building in the zocalo , the type of architecture of the place is colonial and between the tables are some trees , and this trees covers the diners when they are eating .
When you are eating you can look some birds who are in the trees , so it make unusual and different this restaurant than others .
The service are good , the waiters serve excellent , the food is delicious , but some periods of the year the place is full of people and you need a reserve or wait a long time for a table .
The cost of the restaurant dishes is expensive and the cost is around 150 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to choose three best dishes of the place but these three are some of the best typical food of Mexico : the " Cochinita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carne Enchipoclada " .
" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to choose the meat ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deer meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chile chipotle with potatoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dish and you need to choose some of the three type of meat that I said , but this are accompanied by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating of oaxaca and the last dish is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexico .
If you want a different and unique restaurant you need to go Azul Historico , because it has a delicious food , some times have a regional music and the service are excellent .
If we consider the potentiality of this means of communication , the television would be one of the most important invention of this last century .
On the other hand , despite the numerous documentaries , news and cultural programs which are passed on every day , another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of the so - called rubbish TV , which has been impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children .
Furthermore I should probably mention the enormous amount of advertisements that every single day people are forced to watch once they have switched on this box .
In my opinion , the real problem of this potentially useful tool is due to the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication .
As a matter of fact televiewers are not able to decide the palimpsest , but they still can decide to switch the television off .
First , technology has radically changed the daily life of a simple family : computer seems to be necessary and in every house there is more TV than one .
Well , there are a lot of different opinions but I 'm not agree that the effects of scientific progress may be dangerous for the individual .

For example , every day we are invaded by facts form news on TV but it very often happens that some information are left in the background whereas less important information are spread in their place .
Similarly , on TV , during the shows , between a programme and the other we are bombed by the same ads all the time .
For this reason , I think that every day we are continuously surrounded by with information , news , advertising so that we do n't have enough time to think what is really important and what we really need in our life and we can all be influenced very easily .
To whom may it concern ,
I am a 25 years old girl and I have been working in summer camps in my country during the summer times .
My main tasks were : taking care of children aged 10 - 15 , organising events such as parties , swimming competitions , outside sports matches etc . , and overall I was in charge of preparing and cooking meals for more than 50 people .
Currently I am very interested in working in the States in order to improve my English level .
In march of 2014 I got my First Certificated English Level and I would be delighted to up my level and get the Advance Level and this chance to join your company would be a great opportunity to improve my English .
For all these reasons I am the most suitable candidate for this post and my experience is proof of it .
Please , do n't hesitate to contact me if you enquire any further information .

This comedy , entirely shot in black and white , is a parody of the classical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of those films based on the Mary Shelley 's better - known book , and presents a lot of elements that gives this film a really hilarious mark .
The performance of Gene Wilder , as the main character Dr Frankenstein , Marty Feldman , as the hunchbacked assistant Igor ( pronounced eye - gore ) , and the other members of the cast is amazing and has made Young Frankenstein one of the top comedy of all time .
I am writing because I would like to achieve the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) .
I tried three times to pass this exam but I failed .
Do you run a course which prepared for this difficult exam for me ?
It has it 's own rules , tools and the people who are specialized in it .
Over decades music is the eternally art which develop day by day .
We need music in most of our times or even every single day , to enrich our days with happiness and joy , and also to melt away sorrows or depression , that can affect us and prevent ourselves from doing the best .
Music is a science ! yes it is .
Which has many branches and types , those are traditional : owned by any part of the world , and the other international types that all people over the world are share it .
The traditional or local music of a certain area has it 's thumb print on the person of that part .
And the instruments used in that local music may vary from sort to another .
Because the people tend to make it from their own basic culture .
For example , In Northern Sudan people have been used " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .
Internationally , the kinds of music are many , however , most of them share the same instruments .
In particular the Piano is a universal tool that is used by many musicians as a primary controller of the rhythm of the Orchestra .
Last and not the least , music is a sort of treatment to those who are suffering , so regardless of it 's type or nationality it 's a kind of medicine to the soul .
The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods as the inquisition , the knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies since the knowledge through books had become a threat to continue underpinning their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .
Although , some ideas were maintained ; ( for instance , the astronomy by Galileo Galilei ) the book - burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recovering significant books from Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues that spread their ideas to more people becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .
In addition , it was produced the collective readings through the ecclesiastical method with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in the books to all social classes .
On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet in which the access to the knowledge is easier and faster leaving aside books .
People die , but books never die " it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time taking into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the entrance of the information ; for instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
Although there was an oral tradition , the knowledge was accommodated to the political and religious thought of the speaker ; so , the most efficient and objective way to transmit the knowledge was by books and it was not possible because of the burning .
Nonetheless , with the invention of the printing type mobile , the knowledge was different for the access to it .
In contrast , nowadays , the books are not necessary at all ; because of the internet network facilitate even more the knowledge .
That is why ; I could accommodate the phrase by Franklin saying that " the knowledge can not be killed by people because the knowledge is infinite . "
On actual days what we most need is to find ways to prevent childhood obesity because nowadays is a very common sickness that attack more and more children everyday causing them feel bad about themselves .
According to the CDC the percentage of children age 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years on the Unitated States .
This means that in the past tree decades obesity has more than doubled in children , same that had diseases just like diabetes , ashtma , cardiovascular risk factors , mental health disorders and muskuloskeletal problems .
This disease is not just about all the physical and health consequences that have , but also the mental ones .
A lot of kids grow with a different way to think just because the damage that the little ones can cause , one example can be the famous " bullying " , the principal way that kids use to annoy the ones that looks different .
The best way we can prevent childhood obesity is recommending all the families some different doctor that can help them to give a safe life to their children .
Nutritionist are specialists that know a lot about all the types of sickness that can attack on the kids and even the ones that will murder them .
Giving them the opportunity to take care about your situation will change all your life in a good way .
They might be there for you , preparing menus and a big extension of exercises that will help you and change your health and body only if you cooperate .
Nowadays a part of the people buy a lot of things that they do n't need .
In this essay we are talking about above all with rich people .
So money , today , are really important in our life and in this case rich people are very lucky .
They have much money to buy things that they need , and things that they do n't need .
In fact above all about rich families the children are in trouble with their family , above all when they have their parents separated .
Also most of the children grow up spoiled because of the large amount of money of their family , and they grow up with the thing that they want more and more things .
But in the other side there are poor people that aspire to become rich .
And these people do n't have money for things that they do n't need and also for things that they need .
So in this case the money are more important than other things .
So in my opinion today we ca n't live without money , but we have to consider more to feel good with your family and with yourself .
I have little cousins and sisters so I 'm very good with kids , I 've experienced all kinds of situtions so I think they wo n't be a problema for me .
As I said before , I have young cousins and we meet on saturdays so I need to think of activities and games to keep them entretained .
I 'm also very good at sports , I practice trak & field and pingo pong so sports are n't a problem either .
I 'm an outdoors person so I will be very happy with the accomodation . I would be very thankful to work for you if you decide to accept my application .
I am 16 years of age and due to having a sister I really like working with children and also know their interest well . I have enjoyed and practised swimming since I was eight years old and I have also won some competition , therefore I believe that I am suitable for the job .
Furthermore I go jogging every Sunday morning with some friends .
My reason for applying for this position is that I am good on combining my experience in swimming with my wide knowledge of the countryside which I think it will be interesting for the children .
Yours Sincerely
I think that 50 years ago people could n't even imagine what the life would be like in our time .
If this will also be the case for out future , then I think that today we underestimate our future .
I am sure only about one thing : technologies will have a more important place in our lives .
Maybe in 50 years people wo n't work as we do now , instead will build only robots .
Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that would solve all our problems .
I would like to think that in the future we will explore more the universe and we will colonise other planets .
Maybe by doing this we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them .
I 'd like to think that we will find a method to travel through the universe at the higher speeds than the speed of light .
Hopefully , I have chances to be alive in 50 years , so maybe I will see the future with my own eyes .
That morning his grandmother went to the hospital because she had to do a surgery and she told him to buy some magazines for her , because at the hospital she 's bored and she could n't get off the bed for a few days .
His mother was working and his dad was out of town and that 's why she asked him to make her that favour and he could n't say no .
So Peter went home to take his wallet but before that he decide to take a nap because he was tired so he started to sleep but it ended up that he slept for over 3 hours and his mother started calling him at the telephone and she was really angry because he forgot to buy the magazines for his grandmother .
Unfortunately the hospital was already closed to the visitors so he had to wait the next morning .
But I do n't think that in ten or twenty years the scientific progress will be able to produce this type of transport , so we should imagine something simpler .
Even if nowadays people do n't use public transport , in the future they will .
In the future everyone will be able to go on holiday all around the world since the transport will be faster and cheaper .
since decades man preferred to use another way of transporting than his own foot .
In my opinion , that was the main reason for wheel invention .
Scientists could provide in the past years new transportation tools from cycles , automobiles up to motorcycles , motorcars , trains , metros that has been used to arrange and accomplish complete public transportation net through the same country , and sometimes exceeded it to another country boarder upon an agreement between those countries .
Many people assured that they are preferring using their own cars , but they were being forced to use the Public transport for many reasons such as , the complexities they are facing with the driver 's license , in addition to the fuel high cost .
They were more likely forced than having choosing it as an option .
Let 's do n't forget the hard times during cold weather changes especially in winter while reaching the bus stations , or their low chances of having a good place to sit , may be another important reason that raise the private transport scores than the public one , which is molestation .
My teacher asked me to find some songs about rainbows and extracts from the books about children .
Moreover , I went to Vilnius primary school and invites schoolchildren to come to a concert .
The cards included the programmee of the concert and some photos of children from all the world .
It is a very good and useful experience .
I gained a lot of experience while organizing an event .
Also , I learned that you have to be very enthusiastic and self - confident because finding the sponsors for a concert is quite a difficult task I liked that teacher trusted me .
I did everything by myself because everyone had sometihng to do on their own .
I live in Kiev for two years .
I went many times to different places that I had n't known yet .
To start with , you must decide , what kind of shopping do you prefer and how much money you have .
If you want to go to the cheap shopping , you have to go to the Teremky .
You can find many shops there with second - hand clothes you taste .
If you have enough money for Kiev luxury shopping called ' gold shoppping ' , you 'd rather go on Khreshatik street .
You can also find many shops with brand , expensive clothes from well - known world designers .
I often buy second - hand old - fashioned jeans , skirts , trousers , jackets and shoes .
I think it is very good for students , if you want to save your money .
In conclusion I have to say , that in Kiev you can find everything , if you really want to .
In my opinion , technology become more and more important than art which be a necessary part in our life .
Most of people in this world ca n't live without technology .
As soon as we open our eyes every day , we begin to use technology such as alarm , cell phone and light .
The more technology we use the more important it is .
Technology makes us easy to connect our family , friends and co - workers .
I can call my dad who live in New York now then call my friend living in Norway after first call .
Therefore , if I studied abroad fifty years ago , I could n't call my family directly and it is also not an easy job .
However , technology made it easier ten years ago and it became more common in recent years .
It ca n't believe that we keep in touch with our family and friends not only voice and message but also video call , now .
Technology is one of important part in our life , which has made life more convenient .
Before computer was born in this world , we used paper to list something which we should afford it could disappear or be ruined by something .
Therefore , we use calculator to count numbers in a few second .
In the old age we calculated number by our brain that might lead to some mistakes .
Our life has transformed into an easy way by technology .
Besides , the grandest invention is Internet .
I sit in front of my computer and I acquire news around the world .
If I am hungry , I could order some delicious foods online .
As a person said ' ' Sitting near a computer , you will get the world . ''
It is easier to contract entertainment which could release our stress immediately .
In modern world , stress always disturb our life .
Pressure exist everywhere ; for instance , your boss was angry and shouted on you or you should carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father - in - law .
When you ca n't breathe in your life you need some entertainment ; for example , you can listened music with your cellphone or watched some funny videos after all things that bothered you .
It lower our blood pressure and release our stress .
Technology enable us to touch entertainment immediately .
Technology has changed our life in many ways which brings many advantages for us such as convenience , easy to connect friends and easier to contract entertainment .
In conclusion , in these three premises I consider that technology and science is important rather than art and music .
Science practical improve our life .
Have you read any sport magazine before ?
In magazine , they are telling us we can see a lot of games no matter where we are .
Developed technology , we can see the game which happened in the opposite of the earth .
Time and place are n't matter for people to watch the game .
Soccer is the one of the famous sport for many people .
World cup has been the world famous festival .
People can enjoy just seeing the soccer game and they are eager to root for their favorite team .
Why the soccer has been one of the best sport in the world ?
Activation makes people exciting and remember their memory .
This activation make us also enjoy seeing and play the game .
To me , it is boring point when I see the American football .
Sometimes , game just finished with pitcher and catcher 's catch ball game .
Other athletes just stand there and watch the game just like us .
However , in soccer , every single player touch the ball , even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
On this point , there is second reason I can say .
Second reason is that soccer involved for all players to participate into the game .
For baseball , if hitter could n't hit the ball , other players would not need to move at all .
Players are on the same ground and some of people are playing the game and some are not .
Playing almost 3 hours , some players could n't touch the ball .
Can we say these players participating in the game ?
I would not rather say yes .
If somebody wanted to play a soccer , I would recommend that he or she has to have a stretching because soccer is very active sport so always has a possibility to be injured .
Also , I will say you should wear the soccer shoes and socks .
Drinking enough water would be good habit to enjoy not only soccer but also any other sport .
Nowadays , many people have their own favorite sports but people are starting to ignore other sports except their favorite sport .
Soccer could be one of the boring sport to other people .
She knew that her parents were doing a surprise for her , but it was kept in a big secret until night party .
When she came back from school , her parents and all her classmates were hiding in a living room and waiting for her .
When she opened the door , the boys set off the fireworks .
Anna did n't understood what had just happened .
She looked around the living room , and surprised , how many was people there .
Then she and her friends went out , and walked through all the town until early morning .
Her parents looked at her , and they were happy after her .
Their girl has grown up !
In the Czech republic there are many places you should visit .
The Czech republic is wealth for a history .
For example , ours capital city Prague there are many historical buildings like Carl 's bridge , Cathedral of St. Vit , big clock called Orloj and so many others .
If you prefer to go to nature I can recommend you ours mountains Krkonoše , Jeseníky or Šumava .
There is very beautiful nature , calm and fresh air .
You can go there only for a walk or for some sports like running or cycling .
If you go to south Morava , you should definitely try some vines or drink called Slivovice .
Here is also many nice castles .
For example , near Prague is castle called Karlštejn where lived Karel IV . or castle called Buchlovice which is on south - east of your country near the city Uherské Hradiště .
Otherwise , the opportunities for a job here is quite a lot .
I do n't know what to write more .
If you would like to ask something or get to know more information about some place just let me know .
I have experience taking care of children .
I am the eldest of my family so I had to take care of my sisters and cousins .
I enrolled on different courses about children development and currently I am working as an au pair where I have to speak English .
I participated in sports clubs of my High School .
Although I am very keen on rugby and basketball , during the University I took part in the badminton club .
And I just learnt how to play ice hockey .
As I have said before , I have to watch out two kids , which includes cook .
Despite cook is my weakness , I always try my best .
I cook every day different and healthy dishes for the whole family and they love it .
Awaiting your news .
my favourite sports are gymnastics and martial arts .
i 've been practicing martial arts for eleven years but i havent lost the passion I feel about it .
the first martial art that I proved was tae kwon doo and I practice for 5 years , after that i started kung fu and i m still there .
i have been practicing gymnastics during 4 months and fascinated with it , i like to be tired for doing stunts , and I also feel very healthy because I exercise daily , if its not gymnastics it 's kung fu .
I like those sports because you need much strength and dedication to be getting better , I like kung fu weapons and handsfree forms , to do something spectacular in kung fu you have to do acrobatic gymnastics .
I invited my friends to try these sports and apparently they liked , many did not because they did not know well what it was but after living it for yourself you realize that are very beautiful sports .
I tried to renew my membership twice yesterday and there was a message of error both times .
I received a call from my credit card administration this morning to confirm and authorize that payment , telling me that there were two attempts of charging my credit card bill .
After authorizing my credit card administration , I tried to renew it , but again there was the same message of error .
I am waiting for some instruction about what I have to do now to renew my membership .
Owing a pet is popular today even if their home is in a big city .
Many people oday have pets of all kinds .
Owing a pet would benefit all members of family .
First of all , a pet is a friend for the family and mush better is a memeber of the family .
One more advantage of qning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and carring .
It is also good to adopt an animal which it do n't have a home and food and give in this love and affection .
On the other hand there are a lot of disadvantages of owing a pet in big citiew .
Pets and animals in general need fresh air and exercize outside and not being always in an apartment .
I have heard abou pets that they get sick by living in a small apartment in down town and that is terrible .
In my opinion it might seems good to have a pet if we are teke care of it .
All in all , qing a pet in a big city must be done carefully ensuring all that a pet needs .
Television can be able to both entertain and educate at the same time .
Good authors I think have to be able to find the way to keep together these to important aspects .
The first thing that I would suggest TV authors is focusing a set of strategic topics for an advanced society .
Environmental protection for instance , or more practically the correct use of the water in our houses .
Another example can be represented by the first aid activities and so on .
The topics can be easily focused if we have in mind a model of society where individuals have a central role .
Several contents could have an educative value , for example those concerning our relationships with others , or our relationship with nature and with different cultures and religions .
All these topics by using creativity and new technologies can be faced in a way to make them soft and adapt to entertain .
Today , I would like to tell you a shocking news .
It is called " 76 people are confirmed dead in Colombian plane crash " .
I think some of you have already known this news .
Here are some basic informations about the news .
Although I have never taking airplane , I would feel worry if I travel by plane .
To avoid accidents , government and airline companies have to do something to prevent tragedy .
For example , regularly examine the situation of airplanes is needed , at the same time , teaching people how to act when facing the emergency .
Grammar is the most difficult part in learning English .
First of all , you need to preview .If you do this and you 'll have a clear idea about what are you going to learn in class .
And they will also remind you some key points you do n't understand when you preview it .
In the class , you should take notes and write down what is Iimportant .If you have any question then you should ask teachers to help .
At last , when you learn some grammar concepts are new to you , you need to practice .It'll help you remember it and how to use it .
I visit Spaniards Arm quite often .
Usually I am there with my friends or colleagues for a dinner or a lunch .
Surprisingly , they serve it with a half cut bone which is quite fun by itself , even before you taste the dish . Mashed potato is creamy and full of butter .
Meat is perfectly prepared , whether you ordered it bloody or well done .
Try one of the cloudy ciders on the tap and you will not be disappointed !
Taking care of our environment is considered for many of us one of the most important things in our lives .
Nowadays , in order to have the best for the actual and following generations , there are international common ways for individuals to contribute to solving environmental problems .
Everybody knows what separate rubbish into different bins means but , big part of the society believes that it is not worth doing it if there are people that does not recycle .
I would answer to them that , then , how do they explain all the sheets of paper , crystal and plastic items that have been made of recycled materials allowing us to save tons of primal resources ?
Saving energy is the other grand method available to everyone .
Using its respective light bulbs , household appliances and any other thing that saves energy is the only way that individuals can help but , it is not effective .
Although an entire town or city contributes to saving energy in their homes , it can not be compared with the waste of energy that industries make .
Taking everything into consideration , there is a good argument for supporting recycle , which is the following one : The biggest waste of energy take part in primal resources industries , if we reuse all the materials that had already been exploited , we would reduce at least half of its costs .
The chilis restaurant at 123 street , Toronto is really a great place to hang out .
The Scrumptious food served makes me go back there often . if you want to have a lip smacking dessert this is the ultimate place .
Moreover the ambience of the restaurant is marvelous .
If you want to have a quiet cozy dinner you can sit at the table in the corner .
Whereas if you are going in there to party with friends or watch a game you get a table at suitable place . I believe that if we all could go to this restaurant at the end of our course , we will surely have a great time .
Today , recycling used clothes are popular in Japan .
For several years , a secondhand clothing store increase and a lot of people use it .
Japanese people take interest in used clothes .
There is involved with a recycling spirits in Edo period .
In Edo period , there was the society that was called " super recycling - oriented society " .
Almost products and materials were recycled and changed new products .
It was done very natural in their lives .
There were many specialists to repair , recycle and collect products in Edo .
Used clothes were sold by " gyosyo " , that means peddler .
In 1723 , there are 1182 secondhand clothing stores .
It was just the number of union members so in fact , there more secondhand clothing stores in Edo .
The key point why expanded used clothes industry is " kimono " .
Kimono has very simple structure .
It can be made from used clothes to patch and darn .
Another point is that , the cloth was more valuable than now .
So people set a high value on the cloth .
According to these reasons , used clothes spirits took hold in japan .
After that , western clothes became popular in Japan , the recycling system was forgot for a long time .
However , secondhand clothing stores are increasing recent years .
Japanese people have the spirits of recycling and loving old things still now .
Media or also known as mass media is one of the most powerful means of spreading information .
It gives people the opportunity to get to know what happens all around the world in each matter such as poverty , occupation , discrimination , suppression of human rights and so on .
Nowadays we can easily get information which we need through the Internet , in the newspapers , on the TV .
As European citizens we are bounded directly or indirectly with the loads of social problems and issues in Europe so we have to acquire our right of free access to information privately and randomly in order to stop corruption , to acquire knowledge about our rights .
So that we can be active citizens and help the EU continuing developing
I never mind what kind of film I could see .
Nevertheless Today I usually go to the cinema when I really want to watch a particular film .
My likes about films have changed too .
When I was younger I would rather watch romantic films . I used to cry when the handsome boy kissed that pretty girl , or I was waiting for the special moment to say good bye to the bad ones .
Nowadays I try to choose films with good actors or actresses , special scrips and plots , documentary stories or special renowned Director 's films like Almodovar , Sanchez Arévalo o Alex de la Iglesia .
On the one hand Comedies are my favourites ones because I have to laugh when I have finished my work .
But on the other hand I have to get used to go to the cinema as often as I can , but I wish cinema will be cheap .
it 's a pity
I strongly agree with a statement that shopping is not always an enjoyable thing .
There comes no surprise that it is totally difficult to find a necessary thing with a good price in a defined time through a crowd .
Once I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours . I did not managed to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others did not seem to be valuable for fixed prices .
So , I did not buy new shoes that day , despite thatI was happy for getting rid of crowd and shops .
Second , shopping malls have full places of advertisements and loud songs playing .
There is no surprise that a person visits a big shopping mall after his long working day .
What does it happen ?
He hears different kind of songs , advertisements for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality .
The problem goes after the problem and a person starts to feel sick .
Also , It is a well - known fact , that it is totally hot to be with coat in a shopping mall in winter season .
The problem is that a person has to carry his coat in a hand near his other purchases , what is not so easy .
Finally , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriate .
There are some assistants who if you ask or even do not ask , they start suggesting the best their products as well as the most expensive ones to you .
This can make your shopping really annoying , because some type of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of product .
To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoyable thing , because it takes time , it is often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants , who eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products .
Hi jennie ,
I 'm glad you moved , I haven't got round to finding time to share with you .
I 'm afraid I ca n't go running in the mornings I 'm very busy at work .
If I were you I would pick up the one in the avenue , because of the facilities
Working out in the gym twice a week is enough as long as you eat healthy and of course you should forget those delicious cakes you use to make !
What about the Saturday mornings ?
I really do hope you get used to the neigborhood .
The football
The football is the most beautiful sport in the world , it 's the profession dream of almost all the boys when they are kids , when you play in your neighbourhood , you are playing that you 're Messi , or Cristiano Ronaldo or your favourite player of your team .
It 's the funniest sport in the world , kicking the ball , you are kicking the bad energies of your life , you will be infected of passion .
But the passion is not only when you are playing football , you can increment your passion supporting a team in the good times and the bad times , going to the stadium , and when your team reach the glory , you can also feel that , and in this moments you are the happiest person in the world .
So I invite you to join the love and passion when you feel when you are playing or watching a match of football , and if you share this love with another person the passion increases a lot , your feelings are in their higher level , in this sport you can feel the glory , and in the next second you can start to cry because you 're team ca n't finish the way to the championship .
There are lots of interesting sports but there is normally one that you like the most .
In my case is not really a sport in itself , it is a cultural activity which needs a big physical effort .
I consider it one of the best sporty and cultural activities because you keep fit at the same time that you express yourself making an art stuff .
You have to be a disciplined and well - balanced person , that 's it .
Both characteristics will help you in other type of tasks and will improve your future development .
The start is the hardest part considering that your body is not used to do this kind of sport ; however , once you are in it everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active .
So , if you are starting it , do n't give up because of difficulties are coming , just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity .
You will notice how the improvements come up without thinking too much .
One of the things that I enjoy the most is that you dance in a group therefore you meet people and you can make a friendship after a while .
You must not be in your own , otherwise you could not dance in a company , so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that , make a strong relationship forever .
I encourage everyone to try it , I am sure you will become a better person .
I did not find it hard at all , as a matter of fact , it was easier than I thought .
2 . I did n't get stuck often at thinking in which word I should use , which gave me enough time to finish .
3 . I wrote the enough quantity of words required .
Anything was found difficult nor struggling .
I did my best and I succeed in getting a 5.0 .
Neverthless , I would like to improve some skills and although I did very well , I still got confused .
2 . I should stop thinking in Spanish and more in English since translating might be confusing .
Although you may think that is a dangerous sport , which can be , the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in the water makes it worth the danger .
If you are going to start practise it , I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor .
If are not used to do it you can make a mistake , and then it is when the sport became dangerous .
After a few lessons you will be able to go diving on yourself and enjoy the sensation of freedom that provides you this sport .
It is like you would be isolated from the world , just you and the ocean .
I have to say that it is one of the most amazing feeling that I have ever felt in my life .
Without any doubt our life is changed quickly and we do not realise about this .
How will be our life in the future ?
To begin with this , the main change will be the use of renewable resource instead of fossil fuels .
Nowadays , people is aware of environmetal problems and they will try to figure out .
Moreover , there will be important thecnological advances in our life , like as intelligent mobile phones which could help us with day - to - day task .
Not only they will be used to telephone , but we could pay with them .
They will control our empty fridge and if you run out of any vegetables , your mobile phone would warn your supermarket and they would bring it .
However , Robots will not replace humans in the dairy tasks .
So that , we should carry on dust cleaning or washing .
Although , cars will be better than now , they will not fly yet .
The streets will be plenty of cars in the rush hours .
To conclude , it is impossible to argue against the fact that people 's live will change in the next years but , these changes will help to improve our environment and our dairy life .
It is often said , that shopping is a pleasant procedure but sometimes it becomes bothersome .
I will mention some of the reasons why and when shopping can be unenjoyable .
Shopping may cause frustration mainly , when we have to squeeze through the crowd .
On the one hand , overspending money .
Nevertheless , poeople try to save money by every conceivable means .
Probably one of the most discussed topics - global warming , is also most serious issue ; world is facing today .
In this topic I would be highlighting some of the dangers of climate change and different ways through which government and individual may help to overcome this challenge .
One of the most evident effects of global warming is the depletion of the ice at North & South poles , in turn causing sea level rise and encroachment of land .
These phenomenon caused serious damages to ecosystem and sea life .
Further , continuous rising temperature is impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters .
There are scientific evidences , that calamities like Katrina , Hud - Hud can be linked to global warming .
As global warming can have such serious impacts on life on Earth .
It is high time to intervene and take action .
Government can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints .
For example , governments can impose limits on emissions by manufacturing plants and force industries to help in forestation .
For example , individuals can reduce use of the plastic materials , use public transport to control emission , recycle waste material etc .
To conclude , global warming is serious concern which can not be ignored any longer .
Government & Individual both have role to play , in facing this biggest challenge of the Time , Earth is facing .

I believe I have the skills , knowledge and expertise you are looking for . I have worked before for my local community for 6 years while I was looking for my children too .
My task there were vary from working with children of all ages to organise events , sport activities and evening activities . I also helped with cleaning the centre , helping in the kitchen with cooking and working closely with clients and customers in our Café .

Michael is an editor in an international student magazine .
He holds a short story competition to improve students ' writing .
He hoped a lot of students could join this activity so he makes a rule which is if you take your friends ' writing you can get 1 dollar per writing .
While I watched that message , I was excited to find my friends to enter this competition .
I thought no matter who wins the competition , we all must get 1 dollar for prize .
But my friends were not interested in that competition , they thought writing is boring and got 1 dollar is small .
I told them , you can just write no matter what you write .
Finally , they copied my article in this competition .
They only want to get the free dollar , do n't spend time to focus on the writing .
One day Michael entered his company and his employee happily told him , we got many responses .
When he read the content of article , he discovered many of them are similar .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had make a mistake .
Academic culture refers to the attitudes , values and that are shown by the people who work or study in universities .
After I joined ACU ( Australian Catholic University ) I have found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal students study individually , do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused .
Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers .
At first I felt difficult , stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas , opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture .
Academic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning .
( Fisher , as cited in Strake , 2010 , p.2 ) , Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content .
According to Hamp ( 2002 ) , the goal of EAP ( English For Academic Purpose ) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree .
It helps to share the ideas , knowledge , among the students and make them think critically , by using formal language while writing and so on .
In conclusion , the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning .
I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question , share my opinion to the tutor .
In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group .
It 's a restaurant located in Villa General Belgrano , Cordoba and the specialization of it is german food .
You have all the kind of german food you can imagine , from sausages with chucrut to Gullash with spatzle .
You have also common meat and basic food if you do n't want to try other types of food .
The restaurant is beautiful , it 's of a normal size , with many space and very well decorated , you have many photos and paints to see .
Most of the paints and photos are from Germany , because that town was occupated by German people many years ago .
It is also quiet , so it will suit perfectly for the class , we do n't talk that much neither make bothering noises .
People at the restaurant are very kind , the treat you in a very polite way and is worth going there
If we go to Bierkeller we wo n't regret and we will have a great time trying different types of food , learning maybe a little bit of the history of the town and be happy as a group
Almost everybody has ever thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but we do really know all the advantages and disadvanatges that it entails ?
From one hand , a big part of global population consider this year off a way of learning and experience while you enjoy travelling all around the world and you get to know people from all the different cultures .
Nowadays , employers are looking for experienced people who knows how to adapt to all the different situations you can be involved in , such as an international lecture or a difficult plight .
It is also said that at the hour of heading to college , those people who have taken a year off are the ones who have less difficulties to learn and relacionate with other students because they have had used to it before .
It is a fact that those who spend a year abroad working on something , they can save money for university and they become more independent .
Another fact that should be highlighted is that while you are working for a year , people from your age are at university , and that means that they will probably finish their degree a year earlier than you , and this could be an inconvenience for you , because you will have to have a year younger classmates .
The important thing is that you are gaining skills that you can apply for your future career .
Many automobilindustries are working for a new future of automobils .
For many years Apple , Google and several traditional automakers have been running prototypes , which are driving from self and nobody can steer the car .
The question arises if driverless cars will be a boon or bane to us ?
Some people argue that this new idea of cars is a milestone for us and it will bring only positiv effects with it .
First of all self driving cars are good for people who have got a handicap .
At the moment people who has got a handicap can not drive a car on theirself .
This have got a devastating effect for her independence and freely living .
When this people can drive a self driving car the feel more comfortable and the can live more freely .
However , it is also important to remember that people with a handicap have got the same rights and chances as people without a handicap .
Similarly important is the fact that self driving cars are more saftier as no self driving cars .
The rising number in deadly car accidents raise an important question to all of us .
Self driving cars are steered by a very modern software and this software is so exactly that the number of accidents will be decline .
In contrast self driving cars are very expensice and much people can not buy it .
Self driving cars are very modern and drive with a very highly technically software .
Rich people can buy it but people of the middle class not .
In the future this can make a highly gap between poor and rich people .
This is the reason why self driving cars can be in the near future only something for rich people .
The automobilindustries have to work on a plan that self driving can be bought by people oft he middle class too .
When this will be going on self driving cars can be an enrichment for our life .
The Reading museum in Berkshere has visitors from all age groups , but particularly suitable for young people who need help for school projects or want to take up creative things as a hobby .
You can learn various interesting art - works such as painting , photograph , ceramic , from the lifework professionals .

You ca n't miss the stylish cafe in the museum .
Their lunch menus are gorgeous and the price are reasonable .
I really recommend every young people to visit there once when you have time although it might be better to avoid the weekends

subject : the transports of my local area
date : 24th june
as requested , i have investigated the features of the main means of transports which are used in my local area .
my findings are presented below .
buses :
buses are the mai transport in my area .
these are very cheap and people who do not have a car use it to move everywhere . however , this transport isnot so comfortable because sometimes you must travel with lots of people .
cars :
people use their car for travel a long o short distance , this is really comfortable because you can manage the speed and where you will direct .
another option :
when you are not keen on travel by bs and you do not want get the car out the garage , the taxis may be the best option .
these are the combination between buses and your own car .
conclution
I believe that there should be more buses for the comfort of people .
there are several options to choose , but the choice depends on each .
My favorite sport is Football . I like it because it is a sport that does n't need a lot of means to be played .
In my country for instance , people starts playing football at the very early age .
Everybody can practise football .
The other reason why I like practising football is because it is a collective sport .
Finally , football is like all sports very good for health .
Playing football at a regular basis helps to maintain a good health .
As I said , it is not mandatory to have all the dedicated equipment but it could help .
They also have to remember that it is a game of contacts .
So , it might cause some injuries .
And for those who like football but are scary to get injured , they still have the opportunity to watch games on TV and play video game console .
It is common to see during summer many people in parks practising sports , like running , biking , or just doing every kind of physical activities .
Thanks god , I live right in the front of one big park .
So , when I wake up every morning , also pushed because I am a very active person , I get such a motivation to go out and do something .
I sometimes practise biking , running , or even dancing on sunday .
I practise also swimming in my apartment 's pool , and surfing when I manage to get to the beach .
But , not only in summer I practise sports , once in winter I practise also fun sports , like skiing , snowboarding , and Ice skating , among others .
But one of these sports comes to to the top of my thoughts more often : Running .
Why do I enjoy running ? .
I do not have a quick answer , but I can slide some ideas .
If you want to practise this sport , you can simply take a couple of sneakers , and any light sportswear , and start to run anywhere .
There is no need of expensive technical clothes , or special fields , just you , and a place safe and with enough space .
Nonetheless , if you really want to get into this sport as a pro , you can get to invest a lot on clothing and gadgets .
You do not need to get any special training when you start to run , you know it since you are a child .
Nevertheless , once you started to practise running , and want to really get into it , and improve , I do recommend you to take care of your health a to find professional assistance .
Injuries may happen for practicing it often if you do not know the way you step , or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistant that your body needs , for example .
The relationship between famous people and journalist is an attractive focus on our society .
On the one hand , without their career effect , they would as normal as we are .
Famous people need a love , family , entertainment and support .
Sometimes , they are happy , sometimes they are sad
Like we all know technology is making the best of it .
Providing us needs that in the past were n't .
The society is growing and as it grows it gets more used to technology being everywhere .
The mayority ; young or old age , since they are n't old enough or they are too old to drive .
Driving is the reason why adult people do n't tend to use as much public transport .
They just prefer to travel long or short distance in individual transport , known as car .
This is because technology has given us this opportunity , and as time goes by more and better modifications are made to car .
Which tends to catch our attention and waste our money in a way that can me saved up , in this casse using public transport .
This is happening now , and we are not even fully devoloped in technoloy .
Imagine the future , will public transport still be used ?
Will it modify our society ?
IN helping our society grow , but not too much .
Active Leisure Club 's gym is a modern built building .
The clients benefit of professional coaches , who train them in order to perform the exercises correctly .
There are appliances as treadmills , bikes , weightlifting and many others .
Although , there are not showers , and this really is a negative aspect .
You could low the prices a little bit .
That way , everybody could benefit of your spa .
Anyway , their children do not have a special place , so it would be recommended to arrange a safe place for them to play .
I hope that my report helped you , and Active Leisure Club will improve its facilities .
There are plenty of choice , novel , historic , drama or comedy .
Also , there are different form to read , I mean , you can read a book or an ebook .

In this CD , the Singer expresses all her feelings and told us about her last experiences during recent years .
Firstly , you can find songs about her children , lack of affection , broken heart and some commercial songs which have an interesting lyrics .
People could think that if you buy this type of music , you will waste your money and it is just commercial music .
When I listened this CD by the first time , I could sense how the singer break out in these songs and how many aspects of her life thought her to grow up a little bit more each day .
So , I would recommend this CD to other people because I think that they could meet the signer depply through the songs which compose this amazing CD .
Time passed and John had an unimaginable inspiration with his experiment .
One night he went to a party with his colleagues .
He thought it will be good to distracted for a while .
It was already night when he was in Luck 's house ( Luck was an old friend ) and all of them were talking about life things , but then Luck remembered that John was working in an experiment that he did n't know what was it about , so he asked John in front of everyone :
-So , John ! How is it going ?
I heard that you were working in an experiment !
- Actually I am still working on it !
I worked on it very hard even though it was very complex , and my purpose was that it could get admitted by the inspector , and when I showed it to him he told me that it was good but I had to fix some details !
-He said .
-Oh ! Really ! I am glad that you 're doing well ! -Luck said .
When Peter listened that , he was interested in knowing about John 's experiment .
He had the insight that the experiment could be something vital to human life .
He asked him if he could work with him and that he knew something that could help his devise to succeed .
John accepted his help ant told him to go to his laboratory .
As time passed Peter and John gradually became more close to each other .
After four months of hard work , they took the experiment with all the information to inspection .
The inspector finally accepted their work and told them that now they had to be patient because they will going to reproduce many of them .
John draw a sketch to see how it was going to look .
Everything was going very good ; nonetheless Peter intentions changed and became riddle .
There was gap of ambition in him
Padel is a sport activity where you can enjoy with other three friends .
It is similar to tennis but the court is smaller than tennis court .
Furthermore , the court has walls and the ball can bounce off they .
Padel is my favourite sport because it is so easy to play for everyone and it is funny when you play with people who has the same level to you .
I started when I was 18 years and I played 2 days per week .
I am an addict to padel !

Sincerely ,
In my opinion , public transport has been improved during the last years , because cities has been doing a lot of investment for that .
At big cities , such New York , the main public transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
There are other types of public transport such bus , train or even planes for long trips .
I do not agreee with the idea which says that there is no future for public transport , because it is a perfect way of transport for commuters and nowadays , a lot of people is conscious with the global warmig and the envirnoment , and refuses to use the car every day .
In addition , the fuels price is increasing during the last years .
In summary , I think the public transport is a good way to move and the number of users is increasing every day .
Thank you for writing , I was worried about you .
Firstly , it is such a good news to know that you are getting used to your new life .
What have you doing since you moved from here ?
Secondly , I am so happy that you are glad with your new home and how is It ?
Is It look like your old house or it is bigger than this ?
In your letter you wrote that you are missing some people and things , what and who do you miss ?
I can imagine how difficult it can be , although calm down you will find out different things to do and make friends as soon as possible .
If I am not travelling with my parents , I will go to your city .
Nowadays , travel in public transport has been an experience who none has failed .
However , exist now a discussion about what the people prefer , if the public transport or the vehicule of oneself .
Exist a lot of benefits of the public transport , at the start , you do nt have to drive yourself , you can listen to music , read a book o wathever you want without have to pay attention to the traffic , is true too that travel by this way of transport help the goverment because you have to pay it , and the majority of them are cheap enought to everyone .
However , so much people love have their own vehicule , a car , a bick , a moto , because this give you other kind of freedom , you chose the way , you chose the time , you chose the way in you drive it , the positive thing about this kind of vehicule is that you do nt have to take a bus , for example , crowded of people , you can go alone in your car , or whoever you want , but the important is that you chose .
In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has their own pros and cons but in my opinion the difference between both this is that in the secon you chose you own style .
First of all , the most of the people in Extremadura use the car for going to the job , to university or school .
The car is a quick , cheap and easy transport since you can use it when you want and you can park it where you want .
When you use the car , you do not have to think in timetables and you do n't have to pay expensive tickets for travelling .
However , I think that this transport has some disadvantages , for instance : if in a small city there are a lot of cars , the pollution will increase and the environment will be injured .
Also , when a city is small the people should walk to different places since everything is near to your houses .
Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that the Extremadura 's roads need a big reparation because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it .
In Extremadura , the second transport most used is the bus .
On the one hand , there are buses that connect the several neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them .
On the other hand , there are buses for travelling large distances .
The last year , the mayor changed the old buses by new buses without increase the prices .
Now , it is securier to travel than last years .
Also , the seats of this transport are more clean and the bus driver go saying the name of each stop .
In the bus stop there are devices that advice to the people the minutes that they have to wait to the arrived of the bus .
Finally , in Extremadura the transport least used is the train .
The ticket is very expensive and the trains are very old .
We are live in Moscow , it is a very big city , so there are many interesting places , where I used to do some activity .
That 's why I decide to tell you about some interesting place in our city .
I think , Gorky Park is a good place where we can spend our time .
In the summer it is a place where you can play Volleyball in the special ground with sand , play ping - pong or if you are tied you can sit in special hammock .
And in the evening you can go to the open - air cinema .
In the winter Gorky Park is very beautiful and there are ice skating park .
There are dancing square and many romantic alleys , also there are toboggan slide .
Guys should not go to snowbording .
I think it is good plays to other activities .
I like this park , so to my mind it is the best park in Moscow . You should go to the Gorky Park .
Nice to hearing from you .
Most people eat scrammbled eggs and drink a cup of tea .
Dinner contains two meals .
Main course is very heavy - lot of potatoes with meat .
I would prefer to eat more light dishes like vegetables with rise .
Supper always contains sandwiches .
As usual I 'm on a diet , so I prefer only yogurth .
Being fit it 's nice ! :)
I hope it would help you .
I introduce myself : I 'm Italian with an obsession for the English language
I ca n't stop studying English language , I'm a sort of ' englishaddicted , but I wish I were an English native speaker , I do n't know why .
I 've been studying English at school
While studying at the University my idea was to move to the UK to work there , but I got married so I could n't realize my dream . !
I found myself teaching English in my Country , far from the language competence I was longing for .
I will never stop visiting the UK and trying to improve my speaking and writing skills , thanks too to your help .
Nearly every education will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
But , is it also that necessary ?
First of all before arguing this question , it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same education and school .
After that , having said I can clearly write down my opinion about this question .
I think that at my school the balance of this civil education is n't right and fair at all .
This makes it nearly a complete self study education , which should n't be that way at this level of schooling .
So because of this , the placement is always a step ahead to choose for at this question because they will teach you directly more .
In addition , on placement the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
And finally the third and last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at school .
When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are off course useful for your knowledge but , the way of following this lessons are not a natural work pattern .
In a natural work pattern you have to do , also like school , your tasks but the communication is also an important part of it .
This important way communication lacks at school , because it 's a nearly a one direction way of communicating from the teachers .
You have to make a test and they will give you a rating for it .
While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
So with the these three arguments all going in the same direction to explain my opinion at this question , I think it has not to be explained any further now .
Over the last years , people 's attidute has been changing .
The necessity declined that working and living needs to be fairly close to each other .
Moreover , people enjoy being unbound and therefore , they are willing to travel long distances .
However , public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience .
Some people go even so far and do n't assume that public transport will have a future at all .
A lot of public services were cut down in order to save money .
Therefore , busses are not running as often or reglulary as they used to .
Especially in the countryside , public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency .
Firstly , because they gain independence therewith .
Secondly , they can visit each place without any circumstances .
For instance , there is no need to change the bus .
It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is running .
In addition , the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing .
After having had a long day at work , people long to get home as quick as possible .
Furthermore , ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years .
For example , it is no parking space required .
Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
Finally , it still provides a useful way of travel for all who do n't have a driving licence .
In the end , the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a rosieer future .
However , it will remain in the future as still many people use it or even depend on it .
The purpose of this report is to inform about how the city of Granada take care of envirnoment .
Granada can be consider a clean city as regard of rubbish treatment .
There are lot of recycling points of plastic , paper , used oil , glass and batteries .
And there is a big universitary commnunity involved in recycling .
As for pollution it refers , in spite of to have a decent public transport , Granada is one of the worst cities of Spain .
How was said , Granada have a decent public transport and now it is being improved by adding a metropolitan train .
However , Granada can not be considerer as Ciclyng Friendly , there is less ciclyng roads than in other cities of similar size .
In addition , the oldtown is not as involved as it should be in clean behaviour , being the University who make the biggest effort .
I considerer that Granada score 6.5 of 10 about taking care of envirnoment .
There is good points but a lot of work must be done to achieve the eco - friendly title .
The most absorbing place in my town is obviously the Big Castle .
When you will get to the highest tower , you will watch the most breathtaking view .
It is a place where you can always find loads of tourists and foreigners .
When the weather is good enough close to the castle take place many kinds of parties and enterinments .
Like folk dances or shooting with a bow .
Unfortunately , tickets are expensive but worth buying . I also honestly recommend you to see all the places around the Big Castle such as Town Museum or Folk village .
I can assure you will never get bored with this place and all things things connected with Big Castle will make it memorable for you .
Last week , I went to Barcelona with my sister , Caroline , she had to take an exam .
It was a fantastic weekend because we visited some places : Sagrada Familia , Guell Park ... and we walked by the promenade .
It 's a beautiful city and I 'd to go with you .
Tomorrow , I 'll go to visit my grandparents in Galicia .
I hope your answer , I want to have a great holidays this year !
Nowadays almost every person in the world watches movies temporarily or permanently .
Regarding my preferences , I would like to admit that silent genre conquered me .
Of course , unprepared viewer ca n't understand inner beauty of this genre and will choose something mediocre .
I do n't appreciate melodramas or love stories much , but they should be paid attention to .
They are simply relaxing by such a way .
That day was a terrible day with Michael , he woke up and felt totally exhauted after an overwhelming birthday party .
He even did not remember what has happened and a serious headache made him did not want to get out of the bed .
She even did not want to talk to him after that situation happened .
Anyway , he is her son , and she had no choice but to take care of him in spite of any situation .
She talked to him:"How about you today ? " .
He did not answer at all , besides , he hit the chair near her , and unfortuantely , that chair hit her in a serious manner .
She even could not yell a word , just looked at him disappointedly .
It 's a kind of a social network , but it differs a bit from ordinary networks .
In this network you create a profile of your car , write a list of improvements you have done in it , upload photos and movies about you car and of course you meet a lot of people with the same interests .
So they often need help of professionals .
The other website I often use is Google.com because it is the greatest searching service ever created by human beings .
I think it is the best among other searching systems because of it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing excess .
I think that many google users will be happy if the developpers bring more useful information to the main page , for example weather information , carrency rates or hot news .
Moreover google map service needs some improvements such as street names , map accuracy and more city panorams .
I hope your arrival was successful and you have been enjoying our town .
If you want to spend your time visiting famous and very beautiful place and see by yourself the main sightseeing in Moscow , I recommend you to visit the Red Square .
Your group will see many well - known monuments of architecture , which you admire .
There you will be able to find out a lot of information about the history of Moscow and Russian rulers .
You will be very exciting watching St. Basils 's Cathedral , the monument of Minin and Pozharsky , the Kremlin .
I think you should buy tickets and book the excursion in advance , because you can spend much time searching for it .
I hope you will enjoy seeing this place and become really excited by this excursion watching the great architectural monuments
Dears Kate Ashby ,
I am wiring to apply for the vacancy in your cafe .
I have worked two years in a well know coffee franchise and previously three years in famous patisserie as a chef assistant , giving me varied skills , like the ability to work with many different types of people and an extensive knowledge about cooking .
I am a conscientious person who works hard and pays attention to detail . I am flexible , quick to pick up new skills and eager to learn from others .
I am keen to work for a company with great reputation like Green Pepper Cafe .
Your sincerely ,
This result in different views of whether people accept it is easier to raise children now a day .
I hold the belief that the children are really easy to raise than before .
First , the parents only want fewer kids , so the children 's resource must plentiful than 50 years ago .
I hold the example .
My brother 's child can very easy to get the toy which he required directly .
However , my father never got the toy when he was a child , because too many kids need to be fed .
My grandfather must work hard to support his children by additional job .
They had no money could use on entertainment .
That is why I mention that my father never got the toy when he was a child .
Now a day , every child can get more and more resource from their parents because of less competing by other child .
That is what I say that the fewer children can get more resource and easier to be raise .
Second , more and more infrastructures appear in our city .
For instance , in the big city we can very easy to find the specific space to serve our children , such as special toilet and Breast - Feeding Room in every subways .
These kinds of space can make parents comfortable and concentrate on their care .
My brother told me when his baby should be feed when they walked on the street .
They can quickly to feed his baby .
That is friendly for children and parents .
On the other hand , the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system .
Health care system also helps the parents to care of their children , because of people can spend less money to recover their disease by insurance .
This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care of their children .
That being said , I still feel that the reasons I have presented was strong ones , such as more resources and infrastructure .
Eating on a schedule is a very important tip you should take in consideration and also trying to avoid fried meals or fast food .
Unhealthy food and neglecting physical exercises increases the chances of getting fat and having problems with your heart , liver and other organs .
Your body requires many types of vitamins in order to function properly , which are found in fresh or boiled vegetables and fruits .
They would help you immune system , your skin and will also give you the amount of energy you need the whole day .
However , drinking 2 litters of water everyday is essential to your health and has a lot of benefits such as helping energising muscles or keeping your skin look good .
Another think you should take in consideration if you want to live a happy long life is doing physical exercises , such as walking in the park , going to the gym or playing team sports .
It will give you a lot of energy to study and do the things you love , while feeling and living healthy .
-drink excessively alcohol
In conclusion , you do n't have to do a lot of effort to have a healthy lifestyle and there are plenty of benefits from it .
You will feel great , would concentrate better , have more energy and have less health problems .
I am a really cheery person , I like taking walks to the countryside and taking photos there in my free time and in my opinion I am a very tireless youngster .
Besides , I am plenty of availability and I am responsible , patient and social , and I have good communication skills .
My qualifications include a broad experience as a childminder and in organising sports activities .
I would be very happy to attend an interview if you liked me to introduce myself .
Also I would be grateful for information about the task I would be called for if I got the job .
Yours sincerely ,
Thus , our state spears no effect on fight it , transportation now is very over crowdedness and difficult , especially in the rush hour which people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock , the main reason for that is the increasing the number of people in our country ( housing problem ) and the result of that a lot of accidents has been done and a lot of people were died .
Recent U.S. study revealed that the bus ride and trains regularly maintains the agility of the body and helps in reducing weight .
According to a study published by the journal « American Journal of Medicine Brevintev » in August / August next that the more public transport in the city , where population has become leaner and healthier .
The U.S. researchers from two universities in the state of Pennsylvania and the Foundation « Rand » American research and development staff to monitor regularly attend public transportation or go to work by car within a year .
The study results showed that people who ride transportation .
Public decreased their weight by three kilograms on average , compared to people who use the car to move and the study attributed this result to walk to the bus stop and running to catch the bus in the expected position requires goer public transport more traffic , while this does not happen with motorists .
The study pointed out that the public transport network in the United States has not been expanded since a long time compared to the situation in Germany , for example .
He appealed to the experts in political circles in the United States to invest more money in public transportation and improving security in the ways of the infantry in cities and make them more attractive to encourage people to use public transport .
The supervisor of the study , John M ..
MacDonald of the University of Pennsylvania : « investment in public transport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity people » .
Suffered the transport sector in the Arab countries of the many shortcomings and poor performance and is a form of environmental pollution and this is due primarily to a lack of the capacity of public institutions to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately and allocate investments effectively and improve the organizational capacity and result
So it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate cost and in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries are still public transport systems are undeveloped and drive people to rely on private cars .
It has been observed , for example , that increasing the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of congestion severe urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
The optimistic opinion , some people object that " no future for public transport " saying that the future of public transport is clear and the prof of that in ancient there was n't any transport and by the time people starting to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle , cart , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars until the plane , so they hope that the transportation be best by the creative people .
In the other opinion , the pessimistic opinion , in developed countries like Japanese and Kuwait we do n't find like these problems because they have a good planning , they make ways underground and overground , then they have ways only for people and ways only for cars , finally , we should have a good plan and the government should care with that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .
How are you ? I 'm fin .
This day are a sunny and fantastic days and I will start school in a week .
I recommend you to visit the beach because it is fantastic in hot days .
And there are a lot of beach bars for snack between meals .
I offer you to go for a walk to Anec Blau because there is a cinema with some new funny movies and there are a lot of clothes shops too .
I 'm not sure what is the most expensive restaurant in my town , maybe there are some near the beach because the tourist normally go there .
My typical evening out is going to Anec Blau and after that I go to the cinema to watch a comedy film or go for a walk with friends .
According that , I recommend you to visit Tyskie Brewery in Tychy .
It is worth seeing because there is the most famous brand which brews one of the most popular beer in Poland .
In my opinion , a trip will be fascinating because of the fact that the building of the Brewery is orginally German - owned brewery which has been brewering been for almost 400 years .
It contains a liitle museum which is open for tours .
I strongly advice to see that , there is an English - speaking guide who will show you the way of brewing process .
There you could buy some souvenirs - glsses , bottles , T- shirts , cups and , of course , beer !
It is a good purpose , to see and get to know the place , where in Poland produced traditional and well known beer .
I hope you will take it into consideration and go to sightseeing our local but famous Brewery .
For our end of the course 's dinner , I 'd recommend the Asian restaurant Tian .
Firstly it 's a really exquisite place , and it is decorated with objects from the South Asia .
The place is small but it 's very cozy .
They serve all meals in small portions ; and they suggest that the servings can be shared ; so everybody can try more itens from the menu .
The food is really tasteful , each bite it 's an invite to travel by the senses to far away places in Asia .
Finally , to add one more touch to the experience you can take a ride in their tuk - tuk .
Time travelling !
We had been looking at this problem from wrong angle all the time .
The periodic move of minute hand compared to smooth path of seconds hand .
Time is running , seemingly continuously , same as seconds hand on his clock .
But we got this perception just because our eye can see only limited number of images in a time period .
If time period is long enough , like minute , we can see strict distinction between one and two .
We need to slow down the time !
In other words , we have to be fast enough to see that breaks in time .
Then we can just jump inside it and move either direction , as we wish .
He ca n't forget any word of it !
Nowadays we live in society that we is totally dependent on transport .
This happens because , not only we live in a big cities but also we have no time to waste .
Due to this we have witnessed to an increase of traffic .
Public transport are for some people one good solution for many reasons , such as , they can save money and travel quickly .
However , some people say that public transport have no future , they might be right.ple do n't agree with it , they prefer travelling by car .
Some people say that public transport have no future , they might be right .
Considering that the companies now are moving to the surrundings of the cities and the lack of more and flexible timetables some people exclude the public transport option .
As a result of this many people are trying new opitions like car sharing .
It is believed that travelling by car is more comfortable and convenient for everyone , consequently car brand 's look at is as a new opportunity creating new hybrid cars in order not to damage the environment .
I personally believe that because of all this the public transport will have no future in our society .
It was the day of her birth .
She was sure that everyone remembers about the celebration and have a gift for her .
But it turned out that everyone had left the house for work and no one was waiting for her with the wishes .
Day of school very stretched because Anna always thought about the sad morning .
Anna did n't expect that after returning from school she finds his family and friends .
I 'm a teeneger and now a days I recognize there are a lot of ways to get to know something .
In the past technology was poor and only a few guys had a smarphone or a computer .
In contrast , today everyone has the latest model of telephone or computeror whatever .
In the last ten years technology have made a big jump and thanks to the Internet we can search everything whenever we want .
In the past was better than now because grandparents or older people could tell you how to do something for the first time , they could give you some useful advice and you could establish a relation with them .
Today everyone knows how everything is easier with technological machine but it 's more sad because you ca n't compare your thoughts with nobody .
I 'm going to talk about the famine and thirst in Africa .
There is a large number of African children , who suffers with the lack of food and clean water .
Children are supposed to be the future of their countries , but in Africa , especially in the countries in sub - Sahara Africa , there are many cases of famine - extreme cases , so children spend very difficulties .
They have to walk away long distances to have clean water and to work too to survive .
Children who have to work and can not go to school , wo n't get a better life and their dreams never will come true .
Unfortunately this is the sad reality .
Besides that , the lake of food and clean water are responsible for many diseases , which are responsible for a large number of deaths , because there are n't enough sources to cure the populations .
Ear we have some of them : anemia/ anemia ; rickets and malnutrion …
The principals cause for famine in Africa are the ethnic conflicts , which causes warms ; the decrease of fertile grounds and the use of ground only to produce monocultures to export .
Every day , Tom walks next to the river to see the landscape and to feed lots of squirrels which live in the trees .
Sunday morning , Tom was walking as usually when he saw a big poster with a picture of a big motorway .
In that moment he understood that the mayor will build a big motorway there , next to the river .
Suddenly , he thought that the workers will cut all the trees , and the squirrels will lose their refuges , so he thought that he had to do something immediately .
He wrote a letter to the town hall explaining the situation and asking to stop the construction .
He suggested to build the motorway in another place to save the squirrels and to protect that beautiful landscape .
The mayor accepted Tom 's proposal , and he ordered to build the motorway in another different place .
firstly , the primary cause of bushfire is human activities .
lacck sense of civic responsibility is lead to bushfire easily .
For instance , some people discarded cigarette or match which is unattended like barbeque or campfires .
In addition , in many developing country , unemployment they also migrate to forest and set fire to enhance cultivated surface .
Moreover , a small piece broken of bottle or glass can also lead to bushfire .
it will attract sun 's ray and set alight .
Bushfire caused by numerous human activities but almost started from carelessness of people ( Roland as cited in Schauble , 2009 )
My subject will talk about my autumn holidays .
I went a week at Center Parcs in French with my family , my godfather , and my best friend .
We left Monday morning at ten 0'clock , we should have put three hours away but we put double because the plugs .
Tuesday we went to visit the Sainte- Croix Animal Park .
They are more than 1,500 animals from 100 different species .
I saw deer , bear , lynx , bison , wolves , lemurs , vultures , red pandas and other animals .
Wednesday I went to try for horses with my godfather to possibly buy one .
We went in two riding stable but I have not found the horse that I liked ..
Thursday I went with my family to the Strasbourg Cathedral .
And in the afternoon we went to the Center Parc of the pool .
Friday morning we did canoeing and paddle boating on the small river that ran along the center and in the evening we went to the restaurant .
The next day , me and my best friend went to play bowling and billiards . while my parents took my sisters ride a pony .
And the afternoon , the centre organizes a lesson for agility dogs .
I did with my dog .
It is called Canelle , it 's a Jack Russell Terrier .
It 's very small !
It measures about 30 centimetres .
The lesson is not very well , she was interested in other dogs and she was not listening .
At the end , the teacher asked me the exercise again .
It was perfect , she jumped sixty centimeters .
And Sunday morning we returned because the weather was bad .

The graphic information presented in the flow chart illustrates the procedure regarding to the form of bank notes , which can be sorted into 6 main phases .
Initially , the format of the notes should first be designed considering the background color and security issues .
At the same time , skilled machinists are prepared with the use of metal plates in order to set up a fixed mould .
After that , the pringting process comes into play .
50 pieces per sheet are set with special ink prepared , producing images that colors on both sides with a slow speed .
The most significant procedure is called inspection , which means mannual check by particular machines and staffs , and then they are classified into 3 different columns , including good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets , and bad sheets .
In the final stage , the well - performed sheets are packed and distributed to each branches , while the broken ones are safety disposed .
This is the whole process how a bank note is made .
The flew chart shows six main steps in terms of making bank notes .
As following desriptions , namely , Design , Preparation of matal plates , Printing , Inspection , Packaging and Distribution and Disposal .
When you need a bank notes , the first thing you should do is to design what aspects of information you want .
Next , make sure the metal plates worked well .
Afterwards , you are able to print the sheets of the bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet ) .
step is inspectation , where the printed sheets should be
manually inspectors by the officers .
It depends on whether the sheets are in good or bad qualities .
If it is not very well , we can destroyed them securly , however , a few sheets may partially damaged , it does n't matter due to the fact that further seperation will assiste you to get the wrong sheets .
At last , all of
Overview , it is clear that the process of making bank notes begins with Design and ends with Disposal or Distribution .
This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances , but on long journeys that will be very uncomfortable .
Travelling with your personal car is much more comfortable .
It is your own decision when you get up , because there are no time boundaries .
If you use public transport for long distances in a city , you will often change the bus .
There is the risk that you would not get the connecting bus and so you are stressed .
In conclusion travelling by car is the easiest and best way . I think that it is not possible to use public transport because there are no buses or trains .
The most of the time they have free seats in their cars .
So they could spare their cars with other people
here are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans .
Many reasons cause the research hardly going on .
As a result , there is the debate whether educational institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement with qualifications by following reasons .
Admittedly , some of the research need to invest many resources that educational institutes can not afford .
Such research indeed will fail .
Educational institutes should dissuade students .
However , if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study , Educational institutes should support students for their study area .
Education 's greatest purpose is to encourage student to attempt and learn from the fail .
He tried a lot of different materials to make filament of the light bulb .
Once , people think he would succeed .
Even though the research really can not succeed .
Students can learn some things from the course of the research .
In the course of the research , students will think how to develop process of the research and know which segment will cause the problem making the research fail .
In addition , students in the course of research maybe create serendipity .
Like Alexander Flrming Alexander , the inventor of the antibiotic , discovered the Penicillin accidentally from the research of the germ .
" You must do the thing you think you can not do . "
said by Eleanor Roosevelt .
The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility to possibility .
Therefore , Educational institutes should encourage the student attempting the field which unlikely to succeed .
Remember when in school you learned the three esential things for living ; reproducction , nutrition and interaction .
Well , humans become more and more sedimentary whith the pass of the time and forget about interaction and mevement .
Doing sport is not only for getting fitter is also something you need to do as a habit .
Nowadays going to the gym is the new trend , but you do n't only have to do sport because it 's trendy .
I might not have the tipical sports women body type , but I really enjoy doing sport and feeling the glory of movement .
My fabourite sport is tennis , although is not the only one I practice is the one I most like to play .
But that 's not my goal of practicing a sport .
Apart of ovbiouslly having fun and socialice , the way you feel after running and burning feels really good .
If you want to meet young people I suggest you stay in a youth hostel .
The first good thing is they have low cost and here you can meet students from all around the world .
In spite of that the weather has to be warm in summer , you should bring with you not only light clothes but also jacket for rainy day .
I would love to do if I am free .
Quite often , I felt difficult to balance both my study and hobby at the same time .
So , having a good time - management have become important in my study .
I remember that I had a drama play which was held just couple weeks before final exams .
However , instead of focusing on my study , I paid more attention on rehearsals .
As a result , one of my subjects failed because I did not have enough time to catch on the lessons .
At that moment I felt regretful and frustrated .
From that experience , I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for a successful study .
Firstly , to know what is priority is essential for achieving success .
Therefore , I avoided social activities during the period of exam .
In the same way , Rowh ( 2006 ) points out that it is important to get controlled our self .
In addition , not only putting things in order but also well - organized planning are helpful to manage times .
As Academic skill Unit ( 2012 ) states that daily , weekly and semester planner can benefit for arranging our times ( P.22 ) .
In my case , I planned the activities into a proper time because the planners clearly show me the outline in the near future .
Without a doubt , this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility to my own learning .
Therefore , in the future , I will keep improving those abilities and become a more oragniezed person .
As we know football or soccer is the sport king of the present .
It 's a great party and we can have real fun watching a football game even if it 's by television .
Do you want to know why is the most enjoyable ?
When we watch a football game everybody is expecting that at any time someone will score a goal or do some jink that gets us excited and that 's the magic of the football .
If you want to start practicising this sport you have to get fit and run a lot because you got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
And I recommend you to start looking for a football club to start playing with another players .
SHOPPING GUIDE FOR TOURIST
The aim of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in my town and make recommendations to try encourage the tourists visit the shops .
Some of the information was collected on the shops , and on the web .
According to the investigation , the majority of the shops are in two areas ; Firstly the puerto shopping center , it is allocated in Puerto Marina , and the offers of the shops is majority fashion , coffee shops and pubs .
The other big commercial area is in the city center , with a more variety offer , fashion , bars , supermarkets , local food shops , wine shops etc ....
Alternatively every Friday in the parking next to Tivoli World , there is a street market where you can find every kind of products , local products , food , CDs , DVDs , etc ....
Puerto Marina is more visited than the city center , even when in the city center there is more diversity than in Puerto Marina .
In the light of the results , I feel it would be to our advantage if we make promotions of the city center as a good destiny .
I would recommend the tourist office to encouraged the variety of shops In Puerto Marina
In conclusion , the tourist office should have more adverts of the city center .
Dream walked towards me and said do you know how to satisfy a lady .
I will teach you how to satisfy a lady tonight .
I was stunned by her words and become speechless for a moment .
Once again dream said to get ready , I did n't utter a word , without wasting any movement .
I grabbed her hips and dragged her towards me with a force .
She smiled and said not so soon Dreamer , I will take a bath and freshen up first and then we start .

She smiled and said wait for some time I will finish my body massage and then you can join .

The point is that I completely focus on my projects soI spend ten hours every day making a tremendous effort with my budgets , trying to increase benefits and I am doing well .
I manage risky projects and eventually I get high revenues .
I often think what happened if I would make all these effort on my own business ?
For this reason I am reading your book and listening to your podcast .

Yours sincerely ,
Films do not occupy a great time of my spare time .
Sincerely , I found it very difficult to choose the best film .
There are many interesting films with valuable plots and famous actors .
Most of them are extremely interesting and worth seeing it .
But finally I have decided to vote for one of them .
My favourite actor is Tom Cruise and consequently the best film I have ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he plays starring role with his ex - wife Nicole Kidman .
I was impressed by the production because of the its valuable plot .
The story is about the love between two young people , poor man and rich and beautiful lady , who leaves her family .
She wants to try different way of life like the common girls .
Both , they pass through a lot of difficulties and lived poor life .
The aim of the two personages was to gain a piece of land in America .
They have taken part in a competition with riding horses .
Only faster competitors was given the land .
Of course , our tandem gain a piece of land .
The historic context is recreated in the film .
I recommend you to watch this film and I think you will no regret .
Most people in Bali rely too much toward their private vehicles hence they totally abandoned public transportation .
We can consider it as the main problem of traffic jam in the island .
And for me , that 's totally non sense .
In order to do that , it will cost us huge transformation .
Aside from a great blue - print of a well - organized transportation system , which covers a good 25 to 50 years planning , it also involves local culture .
It is definitely a hard job to do when we want to change People 's culture .
A conscience that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live should arise first .
People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling in a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to have each two to four of them trap in car , in other words one massive transportation measure against twelve or more cars on the same road .
The next is an understanding of what we can do to nature by changing our transportation measure .
Imagine the energy that we can keep and pollution that we can stop .
We can change , we have to change for a better future .
We can say 50 years ago we had not thought to have technology currently exists , such as Internet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Also lifestyle was completely different , the industry had not developed technology that now allows you to be more efficient and several people did the work now can be done with a few of them .
So , if technology continues to advance as it has done until now , lifestyle will change too .
Perhaps in 50 years more , we will live in a world where technology makes our life much easier , but at the same time we will be depending on it .
I was very surprised to hear that you want to spend your year off from university in my countrey and I am also extremely flattered .
As you asked for my advice I would suggest to get a job in summer because you said you would only want to work for about three months .
I would recommend a job as a waitress because you do n't need much experience , and I know you do n't have any , and if you get a job in summer as a result you 'll be at the beach most of the time and you can spend the rest of the year visiting other places .
My favourite places to visit are from the area I live in and I would strongly recommend those due to the fact that we can also meet and I would be delighted to see you again .
The place where I enjoyed myself the most was " the Bran Castle " also known as Dracula 's castle .
It 's one of the most beautiful castels , in my opinion , and it represents the most important thing this countrey is known for and that is Dracula .
He was actually one of the rulers of this countrey and he 's real name was Vlad Tepes .
Another attraction which is a unique one is " the merry cemetery".It is famous for the colourful paintings on the tombstones describing , in a very original way , the prson buried there and their lives .
It once was just a simple cmetery but now it is an open air museum .
And if you want to have some fun also there are some fastivals that you might enjoy .
They are quite big and a lot of important artist come .
The biggest one in the countrey is in the cty where I live threfore you 'll have a place to stay and for free .
I hope my advice was useful and I look forwored to seeing you next year the ,
I have two different reasons to explain why I want to study again at BSC in Oxford .
The first reason is because I already have studied there three years ago and it was a wonderful experience , I met very nice people from all over the world , I improved my English level thanks to very skilled teachers and I really enjoy my stay in Oxford .
The second is a pragmatic reason I have a five year degree and I worked for two years in a medical devices company but now I am unemployed .
In Italy is quite hard to find a job at the moment and I want to try a work experience in the UK but it is necessary to become more confident with my English and that is what I hope to obtain from the IELTS course .
The thing that worries me most is to get used to the English weather !
Public transport is common means of transport used in many countries ; Usually transport people in mass from one location to another ;
However as the countries develop and economy grows and life change , people change and standards of life change too ; The interaction factors that lead people to have their own a car is depending and limiting on several factors ; There are also factors such as social and financial conditions that tend to influence people to have their own car instead to travel by public bus / train ; We should also consider the conditions of roads , access and traffic , giving an opportunity to people to opt and travel on own car or public transport ; In some countries there are separate lanes dedicated for public transport which help and facilitate the traffic on condition of heavy traffic ; With traffic technology solution owning a car is always better .
another factor we should consider is the public transport stops on the way to destination which require to plan and catch up public transport to avoid late arrival at your destination .
The subject , no future for public transport is ambiguous as the advantages and disadvantages are both consider on .
Welcome tourist :
This is a guide for you , I hope it can help you a little .
First at all , I want to explain the communication with the town ; a lot of people came by train , it is situated at the top of the town , is the best travel to yours because it is the most quickly , but proving that you prefer to come by bus , the bus stop is near the train station .
There are many shops around the town , for example we have one that where children can make teddy bears whereas the parents can see them from the restaurant ; many children said that it was the best place in the world .
For adults we have a little old museum , where you can live one day like sixty years ago , so If you never have been in one , you should go because it is not cost so much , besides the museum has a kinder garden for the kids .
Apart from that the town is near the beach , and there we have many restaurants where you can eat while you are watching the waves on the sea .
Our personal recommendation is the " Sir Hotel " is a muddy hotel because many years ago it had been a castle , as well you can sleep in the king bed and every night it has theatre where you can take a part in a play .
I am writing in reply to your advert , which was advertised in the local Newspaper on 31 May 2008 .
As you can see in the attached CV I have experience working with children of different ages .
During three years I babisitted my neighbor 's two daughters .
When I started they were of 3 and 6 years old and I loved to prepare crafts to do with them and usually I had to give them dinner .
In addition , the last three years I have been as voluntary in my tennis club , where I have developed different skills to organize activities , sports games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 years old .
I enjoy doing whatever kind of sport with my friends .
Working with children I have learned to be more patient and moreover I am able to motivating them to do the best of themselves .
Also I have gained communicational skills speaking with the children and the families .
In order to work in the kitchen I am a really good cook and I used to help my parents every weekend .
Finally , although I usually speak Spanish , my second tongue is English .
Without doubts I am the person you are looking for and it is a job that I would be very excited to have .
Sincerely
Besides its advantages are cheap and fast there are many disadvantages of taking bus or train such as time , quality of serving , and crowdedness .
it is said that instead of taking public transport , commuters will travel by car because of its convenience . in my opinion ,
public transport will be hardly replaced by travelling by car .
First of all , Public transport is used by many people who do not have cars like students and workers . They can afford to buy tickets .
For example , my student time , I used to take busses to go to school every day and come back home .
Secondly , The infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars .
Traffic jams always happen in the rush hours when there are so many cars on the road .
Fossil fuel is running out of resource .
It makes the petrol 's price increasing every day .
It has been affecting to the environment like climate change , increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to increasing the demands of using petrol for private cars .
In conclusion , public transport would be the excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting .
The aim of this report is to examine the available local transport usage and possible improvement .
Currently , the local transport available are buses and taxis .
The most used public transport is the Bus .
The town is covered with more than thirty lines most of them with a duplicate performing the same path on the opposite direction .
However , Buses are mostly used by very young people and old people .
Children often use them to go to and back from school , and the older population , with increased problems seeing far away , prefer to use the bus to travel around the city .
In my opinion , the biggest problem with buses is that they are becoming very degraded , and in desperate need of repair .
For the average middle - aged person the logical option is to use a taxi .
The bad side with taxis is that they are still very expensive , with all the extra taxes and different zones .
There have been rumors of the contruction of a Metro in our town .
That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation , since they are fast , are n't affected by traffic , and they are generally cheaper ( since they rely on electricity ) .
that 's amazing , I just wanted to write you an sms and at the same time I 've received an email from you !
It 's great that your college mates want to visit South Bohemia .
I 'll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting for them for sure .
First of all , if they are staying in České Budějovice , they can spend there at least three days with sightseeing .
Anyway they must visit our main square with many historical buildings .
They can climb on " Black Tower " and listen to singing from the town hall .
There is a huge number of shops in the centre so what about doing shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is for tourists very convenient because they can reach everything on foot .
If the weather is nice , they could definitely take a trip to Kleť .
It 's the biggest hill where you can go on the lookout tower and it 's not far from České Budějovice .
There is an interesting observatory too and what 's more the best restaurant I have ever been in .
There 's a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle placed on the big rock .
They can see there 2 brown bears and lots of souvenirs shops too .
I hope your friends'll be satisfied with my tips .
The statement given in the rubric proposes an issue of the future of pulic transport in developed countries .
I do n't agree with this viewpoint due to several reasons .
First of all , vehicles designed to carry large number of people can not be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megapolises are suffering from surplus of automobiles .
It happens not only because of environmental aspect , but mental as well .
Regular citizens seem to be tired of eternal traffic jams and yards , filled with parked cars .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of average person , who spends most of the time in downtown , to replace a car for a bus or an underground .
Secondly , taking into account of long - distance trips can not be avoided .
Whatever type of journey you took , you would be more likely to prefer using train or plane , because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical tension .
Mental one can not be excluded , but that is the different question .
Overall , there are a number of causes to disagree with the suggestion , that individual transport is getting more and more popular in comparison with public .
The only thing , that definitely should be changed in the future , is an approach to usage of cars powered by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Concert Hall , it can be found a Japanese restaurant named " Ichiban " , opened a few years ago , it 's not well known yet , but this does n't prevent that quickly gets busy at the weekends at lunch time .
Although sometime it might be rather noisy , because of the people gathered there , I find its decor quite attractive and , as usual in this kind of restaurants , relaxing .
However , it might be that you had to wait a while for your food to be served , but worth it .
You can choose from a variety of dishes in their menu - sushi , maki , " etc .
Different kinds of sashimi are offered - of mackerel , sea bass , octopus , butter fish .
It deserves to be mentioned the great variety of rice and noodles - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes are served with a careful presentation , are highly creative and very attractive to the eye .
As a conclusion , I recommend visiting " Ichiban Restaurant " , you 'll have the chance of enjoying a delicious meal in a certainly agreeable atmosphere .
However , traditional teaching method , force - feed the students , has made me overly dependent on teachers in China , which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately .
Compared with EAP course , it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently , especially for academic writing .
Firstly , it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time , because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers supervision , so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently .
By this trend , I have became a procrastinator finally , which enabled me to face the problems of time management .
In this sense , the term , " time management " means the ability of controlling time on prioritizing tasks , and planning effective scheduling of time to balance study and work , and keeping concentration on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Develop a strategy in studying is vital .
Rowh ( 2006 ) states you will stay up late for accomplishing assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance .
Therefore , the best way is leaving 30 minutes everyday for reading and beginning to read at once .
Based on examining my actual experience and research , I noticed that a gap , unsuccessful time management in independent learning is the root cause of these problems .
Then I made a few conscious changes that I began to manage duration for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks , as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life .
As an independent learner , it is my sole responsibility to autonomic learning , which is a very important factor in future passing EAP1 successfully , as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
The most historical place in Spain , it is the city of Cáceres .
It is in the south of Spain , there the weather is warm .
Cáceres is visited for many tourist every year .
At the beginning of the 7th century , Cáceres was conqueted by the Arabs .
At the end of the 14th century , Cáceres was conqueted by the Romans .
Therefore it is a multicultural and multirracial society .
On the other hand , Cáceres are divided in two main areas , the new city , which has modern and high buildings .
As well as the historical city , it is short and narrows streets .
The center of the historical city is the Big Square , there are mixed Arabs and Romas buildings , and two cathedrals .
Jorge was a kind , who won an important battle against Arabs .
In the first place , people are really fun and friendly .
In the second place , you would learn the history of Spain on these streets .
In the third place , this year Cáceres is the capital of the gastronomy in Spain .
My favourite restaurant is Chinnesse .
In Caceres we can eat Chinnesse food in Food house .
Some people do n't like this food , but in this restaurant you can eat other types of food , for example Spanish food and Mexican food .
The atmosphere in this restaurant is very good and very clean .
This restaurant is very big , we would n't have a problem .
Waitress and waiters are very friendly and funny .
This restaurant is buffet , we paid 15€/person and we can eat and drink all that you want .
From my point of view , this restaurant have one drawback , the waiters and waitress do n't go on the table , you should go to your food and drink .
I love this restaurant , the food is very delicious .
In this set of materials , the listening passage discusses advantages of alcohol and how they contribute to improve health , and personality and the reading contradict this by revealing down side of it .
In the listening passage , the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent , due to the fact that it reduce blood clot , and slowing the deterioration of brain function .
In addition , moderate drinking helps to keep healthy movement , because some researches has shown that people who drink moderately have less proportion of body fat , because alcohol speed up metabolism which makes calories burn quickly .
Moreover , it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non - drinker , and they are more social , popular and they are likely to be married .
On the other hand , the reading contrast this by mentioning disadvantages of alcohol .
Firstly it is stated that alcohol lead to weight gain , because it has more calories per gram than any other drink , and it is mentioned in the passage that you need to walk a mile to lose calories of glass of wine .
Furthermore studies have shown that alcohol induce appetite which makes people consume more than they need .
For example researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol .
Second , alcohol can cause some serious health issues , especially cirrhosis of the liver , heart failure , brain damage and variety of cancers .
Third , alcohol takers tend to aggression and violence .
In fact studies shows that 86 percent of all homicides and 60 percent of sexual assaults , are linked to alcohol
With the development of globalization , there are varieties of impacts for different aspects of daily life .
People also have a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages .
This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China by some examples .
So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses .
In recent years , there are some different size of logistic companies have been hold , and different modes of transportation has developed rapidly .
For example , in the past the main transportations were ships , trains and trucks , so people had to wait long time for their parcels and letters .
However , now the increasing number of consumers and logistic companies has chosen airplanes which can save much time to transport their parcels .
Secondly , there is still a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in China .
However , because of the increasing standard of living , a growing number of people have chosen to travel which has brought a heavy pressure of transportation .
So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people , the government and experts have to think some different ways to solve this problem .
For example , some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centre .
In conclusion , globalization on the transportation has brought both positive and negative effect to Chinese people .
So in my opinion , people need to find right ways to let globalization push the standard of our living whereas discussing its advantages and disadvantages .
Bra is a small village of Italy and it is also my town .
If you visit it you will probably appreciate all the innovations applied to save our environment .
For example all the members of the town council use bikes so they are a good example to all citizens .
So if you want a bike , to move easily , you have to make a card which allow you the access to all bikes situated in specified places in the city .
In my town cars do n't pollute .
These engines use bio fuels so the environment is not affected .
I think if we want to protect our environment starting from the little things .
Moreover If you want to find good job you must able to speaking two or three language without any problem .
You should speak accurately and also fluent .
I know to speak three language .
Also I know Spanish and besides I 'm learning English right now .
I 'm living in Worcester one city from England .
I 'm au pair .
The last year I was in Poland and I could see how was important to speak English , with this idiom you can communicate with other people , no just English people if not with around the world .
When I was a child I did n't understand why I needed to learn English but now I can see how important it is , for this reason I 'm motivated to learn .
On the other hand I love travelling and in case that you know several language all will be easier .
You could understand the guide , the sign ...
you could enjoy a lot and learn more about different cultures .
On the contrary to learn language take a long time and you need to be patient .
Moreover the languages courses can be expensive in my opinion the best thing that you can do is move into other country it would be easier to stay motivated because you need to learn it to find a job or to make friends .
As far as I can see , it 's important to know languages no just your mother language .
It could be nice and give you more opportunity to do whatever you want and do n't lose heart at the beginning could be difficult but bit by bit you will see your progress .
With thousand years of built and fight for the liberty of our nation , we can be proud of our history .
Vietnam is a small country but had defeated two big nations which wanted to turn Vietnam into their colony .
With strong patriotism , Vietnameses nowadays are trying to develop the nation , to get in the globalization progress .
However , as a resident of the country , we can not forget about the history and about our ancestors services rendered to the nation as well as our culture and ideology .
Each nation has their own historical places , Vietnam is not an outcast , we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand throughout about the past .
Those places will help them to take a close look about the root of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture , custom and tradition .
We can mention many places such as Sword Lake , Hỏa Lò prison , Temple of Literature ...
Today , I will mention about one of the iconic places of Vietnam which you can not miss when travel to Vietnam .
It is Temple of Literature , the first university of the nation .
Temple of Literature was built in 1070 under the Ly 's dynasty .
In spite of wars and the destruction of time , Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape until now .
As many other Asian country , in the past , we were greatly influenced by the ideology system of Confucius , a philosopher from China .
He built up a system which based on 4 essential relationships in the society .
The lessons that scholars at that time were received , most of them were about his ideology .
Otherwise , they learned mostly about literature , poetry .
We can briefly describe the overall structure of Temper of Literature which consists of six parts .
Firstly , there were 3 main gates , the center one only for the king , the left side one was for administrators , the right site one was for military .
Scholars only could enter by a small gate from aside .
One remarkable , featured point about Temple of Literature is the people who passed 4 rounds of examination , then gained position titles would be graved their names on the stone grave carried on stone turtles .
Right at the moment entering , you can see them from two sides of the courtyards .
Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now .
Before the university entrance examinations , many students come here and wish for their luck .
Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy ) can be seen as the most featured historical place in Vietnam .
It contains not only the history but also the culture , customs also it is the first official institute which you can not miss out .
I do a lot of sports for example : cycling , karting , football and basketball but my favourite sport is swimming because I have done this sport since 1995 with my grandfather .
I love swimmming because if you are angry or your job is very stressful , you will feel well after thirty minutes on a pool .
Also , you meet a lot of people while you practise sport .
This is a relaxing sport because while you are swimming you can think in your life .
Other good point about this sport is that you should move all part of your body .
Actually , this sport is very healthy , so some doctors are recomending this type of sport .
You can do different sports on the pool for example : swimming , water aerobics , Olympic diving or diving .
If you begin to practise this sport , you should wear goods snorkeling glasses and you should warm up five minutes before you get into the pool .
Besides , you can have could shower after and before that you do swimming , this is good because your body temperature is hotter than the water of the pool and if you get into the pool very fast you can have a problem with your body temperature .
Sapporo is an attractive place because raw fish and vegetables are fresh and nice to eat .
Fuji is the most wonderful place in Japan because its scenery is so beautiful , it is a popular place and it offers several exciting activities .
Fuji changes to a white face by snow .
Fuji is very beautiful , so it has been the subject of countless works of art such as the ' Thirty - six Views of Mt. Fuji ' , a series of " ukiyo - e " paintings by Hokusai .
People who come here are so many .
To climb to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters .
However , numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful view such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt .
Besides , a marathon takes place ever year .
This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope , so people who are proud of strong body try this marathon .
These offer a camping , fishing , cruising , and taking a hot spring bathing with a nice view .
Enjoying an activity with a nice view is relaxing to people .
Fuji will continue to give wonderful impression to many people forever .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise as there was nobody standing .
There must have been a naughty child ' I thought without worrying .
Later on the week I was doing the dishes when the kitchen door suddenly opened for no reason however I felt the same hot wind in my face and the same funny smell .
The next time it happened to me such a thing I felt no wind but this particular stink .
At that time I was unemployed so I was n't able to move house and as I was n't afraid of it I had to put up with those strange events .
So I decided not to pay any attention to it and carry on with my normal life .
Now I have to admit that I have a problem I am sharing home with a ghost or two but I do n't mind as long as he or she leaves me alone .
My name is Cristina and I am 19 years old . I think I am the suitable person because I have been working with children for quite long .
My parents both have been working since I was 12 so I had to take care of my little sister , who is four years younger than me .
Moreover , I love spending time with children .
For this reason I have been doing three courses during this year .
These are quite interesting and have helped me to know deeper children 's pleasures .
I have learnt a lot of activities which let them have fun at the same time they get in touch with nature .
My grandmothers used to run a restaurant and she taught me some Italian recipes .
I am available all summer so I could start to work whenever you would need to .
I would like to know as soon as possible whether you are hiring me since I have to look for a cheap and good qualified air company which I can afford .
Please contact me if you needed any more information about me .
Best wishes .
My name is John , I 'm twentynine years old and I live in Romania .
This month on the 9'th I 'm going to have an oral and writing examination on my English language knowledge .
I am particularly concerned about my speaking skills and I hope I will not be so nervous in front of the teachers .
The exam is assumed to be on professional matter .
Subjects like passport , travel document , third country citizen , inhuman treatment or punishment will be the main criteria to the exam .
I have three more days to prepare myself better , but to be honest I 'm not in the mood of studying .
She said she will join me for the exam .
In fact she will also participate in the exam .
Hopefully I will pass the exam and will attend the English course for a month .
Afterwards I will have the right to take part to the intarnational missions for maintaining the peace under the patronage of the European Union .
I wish to come back happier .
Dear Ms / Mr ,
- Our village has only 200 citizens , therefore the amount of rubbish produced in year is insignificant to the environment in our area .
- There in a recycling facility near our village and 80 percent of the rubbish is being recycled .
Secondly , I am going to inform you on how our citizens are tryinq to keep the area clean .
- There are cleaning campagnes twice a year .
Lastly , I am going to explain how is our village kept attractive .
- Last year there was a campage for renewing and repairing the most attractive parts of the village .
All the important buildings and monuments had been cleaned and repainted .
In conclusion , I would say that our village is an example for environmentally conscious city .
I hope this report informed you fully on the environmental situation in our villge .
Sincerely yours ,
It 's very hard to organise a big city 's rubbish delivery system and to keep the city clean .
In connection with the first issue , Budapest completes the task very well .
In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely .
In the new buildings there are usually dustbins for each material ( glass , plastic , etc . ) , and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins .
So , almost everybody , who lives in Budapest , has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection .
It would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible , and there are factories , where they use this technique , but in Budapest we usually do n't use much recycled goods recently .
And it is a serious problem , because in the not so distant future we wo n't be able the handle the garbage - it wo n't be enough space where we could deposit that .
An another ( one could say the most ) important question about a capital city is : how clean is it ?
In that area Budapest accomplishes very awful .
In spite of the number of the cleaners , the town is dirtier than Vienna or Prague .
Naturally it 's mainly depends on us : if we could put our garbage into the dustbin , instead of letting it on the streets , it would be easier to keep it clean .
Since yoga entered my life I try to change my common view of many things .
Ecological situation is seriously bad not only in my city but in my country in general .
Rubbish recycle is the biggest problem in Kyyiv in my opinion .
All the rubbish is taken to the huge dump a few kilometres off the city .
Still we use plastic bags and bottles , phosphate detergents , throw batteries away .
Unfortunately we do n't separate rubbish .
There 's no factories and plants to recycle all these materials , though we 've already got special yellow bins for paper and glass in the city streets .
For a very long time I 've been doing my best to separate rubbish and then , it was really bright summer morning , I saw that special yellow bin for paper and glass was emtied by the same car with the other rubbish ...
Yellows bins was carried away from our yard in a few days .
Once again there 's only one bin for every group of rubbish .
Dear Sir or Madam .
I have just read your advertisement at your page for recruitment people in summer camps all over the USA .
First of all I have provided experience working with children in that range of age .
I have taken courses about First Aid Kit even I am doing a course as a personnel training for children with some delay and disability .
On my spare time I work in a non profit organization as a clown .
I have been learning English for 8 years after that I sat for FCE exam two years ago , as soon as I pass the exam , I start preparing a cetificate advance in English exam even more I could demonstrate my English skill , writing and spoken .
Finally , I am suitable to have an interview if you consider positively my qualifications .
The fact that " shopping is not always enjoyable " might be considered an universal truth .
When it comes to clothes there are also different kinds of people , the ones who do it for necessity and the ones who do it for joy .
The former might not be so enjoyable whilst the latter , obviously , does it for enjoyable purposes .
It all depends on the type of person buying it , their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now .
In last place , it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are buying ( i.e. the room , the organization , the prices , the distance , etc ) and the unknown people who are in it which may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable .
These factors will be explained in another occasion .
In conclusion , shopping might be both : enjoyable or not .
In order for it to happen , a range of different variables have to take place .
Although there are a lot of people who strongly believe the best way of travling around the city is by motorbike , there is also a big part of the society who is sure it has too many drawbacks to be worth buying one .
One very important positive aspect is that , thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is considerably economical .
For example , the lack of safety , which raises the probabilities of getting hurt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage this kind of vehicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike consequently not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable owning one .
Have you ever been in trouble , which type of transport you should take ?
If you must come a long way , then you 'll probably opt for travelling by plane ...
It 's a good idea , but ... I 've got an aviophobia !
It makes my every journey unpleasnt and I feel uneasy all the week before the flight .
But excluding cases like mine : flying is the fastest , the most safe and often the cheapest way to travel .
But this mode of transport is n't so comfortable , esspecialy when we must travel onshore , then it 's complicated because travelling by boat is allowed only by the sea or any sizeable river , which courses are usually placed less conveniently than roads or even railway tracks .
In that case it indicates that my favourite way to travel is train !
For me it has some very important advantages , like that you do n't stand in traffics , reductions for students , low risk of accidents , potentiality of sleeping , eventuality of travelling with bike or other big luggage .
Most railway lines are quite spruce and for me , travelling by train is pleasure !
In my opinion , everything depending on our preferences , but train is general - purpose means of transport , I recommend it !
My favorite sport is badminton , which I have played for seven years and touched this sport when I was in junior high .
At first , I 'm not interested in it , since I did n't any idea how to play , as I had only played basketball and volleyball , however , I did n't enjoy these two at all .
Moreover , I also did n't like to do exercise which was tired and my strength was extremely weak that every time when measure 800 kilometers I always ranked the last three .
But when I decided to sit aside and chatted with my friends , one of my male friends , who has still kept in touch at present , asked me to play together .
After he got the reason why I did n't have any desire to play , he told me to give myself a try , and if I still did n't like it , he would't force me .
Then , he taught me how to play , for example , when hitting , used the strength of the whole arm and did not just used elbow , or you would feel tired shortly .
While playing , I rejoiced at this exercise , because I have never sweated so much and felt refreshed before .
The funniest thing to me was that I thought I were a kid who studied kindergarten for the way he taught .
When hitting ball back successfully , he would say ' ' good , keep going or you did it '' .
Hitting ball again and again , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , which not only includes running but also concentrating .
Badminton is an easy sport that everyone can try , just focus on ball and hit it back .
In addition , before playing , must warm up your body and relax your muscle after playing in case suffered injuries .
In addition , having been equipped with my rather good English - speaking skills and cross - cultural communication skills obtained during the working time as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company , I feel very confident and amicable while dealing with customers .
With such qualities , I strongly believe that I will do this job very well .
Another reason I apply for this job is that it will be really a good chance for me to help partly increase my income at this time and improve my family 's living conditions .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admit that young people has more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advance that older people tend to not understand well .
Also , because of the fact that the urbanization have not helped most countries to adapt the cities into places more accessible to senior people .
The new technologies are something that we can not love without anymore .
I am one of the fortunate people who was born on the technological era , which means that I have had access to computers , gps and mobiles , for example , since I was a little child .
The technological equipment help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them .
The fact that these utensils are familiar for youth make them helpful and useful .
On the other hand , to someone who did not have these when they were more young and active , such as grandmothers and grandfathers , the new instruments are just things that they can not use nor understand .
Another transformation , which is corollary from the advances that humanity have been seeing lately , is the modification in the cities and our living habits .
The urbanization implemented by government across the decades in the cities are sometimes not suitable for all public .
For instance , older people or the ones with disabilities have great difficult to use the metro system because of the number of stairs .
My mother is a perfect study of case for me because she can not well the transportation system in Paris or New York without been lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting .
Sometimes , the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement around on big cities compels the older population to stay at home .
Therefore , the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who is capable of understanding how to manage the modern instruments and use all kinds of transportation .
On the other hand , for the older people , the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle for them to enjoy all that there are out there .
The aim of this report is to give my opinion about the facilities and services the Active Leisure Clubs .
In general the facilities are well preserved but the majority of the users think that the installation should have an improvement in the baskteball and tennis courts maybe the bathroom should be remodelled .
The workers are very kind and simpathetic and enjoy teaching .
In other words I could say that is the best Club I know .
Desadvantages
I believe that it would be a good idea to fall in the cost of some activities .
Curiosly the Club is closed On Saturday evenings and on Sunday .
However , the majority of users want to use the Club at weekends and to spend their free time here .
It 's recommend improving the facilities , falling in the price and opening every day until 10.00 p.m.
Since car was invented , we have been seeing a large increase of cars ' production and of its use .
In early days , public transport system was n't very efficient , as it was in its beginning .
There were few buses and they would take to long , therefore waiting time was quite high .
However , as time went by , improvement has been made in public transport .
Nowadays , they got modern and comfortable and they are n't as late as they used to .
Travelling by car might be more pleasant but it can also be costly , for fuel can be very expensive depending on the current economy .
With regards to traffic , travelling by public transport can also be quicker , as there is a bus lane and no traffic for tube .
However , over the past years , people have been travelling mostly by car which seems to have led to higher levels of air pollution .
In spite of all campaigns aiming the less use of the car but more of the public transport , people still seem to prefer to travel by car .
Celebrities and their life take intrinsic place in lifes of contemporary people .
The process of becoming this fact real and common in our society began about 100 years ago and what is really absorbing , nearly 95 percent of advanced society can not imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all .
The question is if it is good to take a leaf out of their book and I am going to talk around it .
It is good to have your unique value system , but the stories about people who have been doing good affects you and your future decisions .
Probably if you hear about heroic attitude you will be able to do without doubts something magnificent as well .
In this way I think that is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous .
The second thing is that if you are in trouble you 'll feel better than usual because of well - known dramas based on factual stories which happened to the famous people .
How the English say : better the devil you know .
There are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them - it is called low self - assessment .
Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities ' private life and professional career you have to remember that the media distorts reality .
If something is n't catchy will not catch the poeple attention .
The press editors often alter details thereupon they get selling well material .
If you believe that the media says true you are wrong .
Of course you can look up to the celebrities but you have to be aware of the consequences .
Each kind of guiding light help us , but the most important is to choose the right and accurate person .
The aim of this report is to describe Schedrin 's School of arts for children and youth .
Students are taught by the highly qualified staff .
During the whole school year a great number of exhibitions , concerts and performances are given by pupils themselves and by invited musicians and artists as well .
Children have to take entrance examination .
The other thing is that students are not able to refuse attending some classes they do not like because those are considered to be a part of an educational standard for the particular artistic area .
phenomenon of homeless people became a serious problem and many countries can not solve this problem .
The number of these people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world .
In my opinion , homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without a shelter .
First of all , being without home is a horrible problem .
One of the major reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Arab countries like Syria , Libya and Yemen .
Everyday on news We see the refugees who are in a miserable condition .
They live in tents that do not protect them of cold weather or dangerous insects .
In addition , financial crisis , almost of the companies has a financial problem so the ideal solution for them is downsizing .
After a while the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live , and they will become homeless people .
Furthermore , children street is a result of families troubles .
Cases of divorce are increasing and many children escape and prefer to live in the street instead of home full of problems .
As opposed to the idea above , some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger on our society because they need money and food so they can steal or kill for this .
To conclude , the world has a complicated issue , so The governments and the charitable organization must take a quick decision and put a real solution to solve this problem .
The homeless people are human beings and they must take their rights in life .
After the second false start you 'd be disqualified and then you can kiss victory goodbye , - that 's how I mentally tune myself , - Take it easy !
There is a four hundred distance and ten barriers ahead - that 's where you 'll show what you got .
I look around tribunes : there are n't so many people despite the fact that today an Australian Hurdle Champion of the season will be defined .
Well , may be it 's for the best - less pressure .
Although whom am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervously stretching out stiff neck .
- The pressure is so high that it can be used as a gasoline to fly to Space .
Six other sportsmen are shaking like minnow grounded by chance .
I must be looking like them from the side .
Everyone 's nervous except for Jerome Tanny , last years champion famous for his threatening prestart grin , that we all call " Shark 's Smile " .
Tanny is a human - rocket that 's warming up on a neighbor track line .
I know that my old man Navarro is the one to have sweaty hands now !
Even from here I can see his anxious look and the way he 's fidgeting on a bench .
That 's strange but before the start my thoughts as if an old steam locomotive are going to those depths of memory which really hard to get to in ordinary life .
Owing to the increase of population , human beings use more land to build houses , which leads to the decline of forest rates .
The large - scale building projects do let human have homes , but not the animals .
Thousands acres of forests to be destroyed , letting the climate change .
Our cities put off to much carbon dioxied , making the gobal warmer .
The change of climate leads a lot of terrible things to breaking out .
The floods , droughts , and famines , all of these making great effects to human and animals , for instance , the loss of properity , the missing of people , which is not good for the development of human beings .
For one thing , animals do not have homes , so some of them become endangered species , worse still , dying out .
For another thing , human will be hard to get close to the nature , and the noises of cities will do harm to human 's health .
I think that efforts must be taken quickly to protect our homes by goverments .
Firstly , the population should be controlled , if human still increase rapidly , there is no more room for human .
Secondly , governments should teach their people how to protect the environment , such as destroying the farmland too much is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be put up to provide room for animals , and we can help the endangered animals in this way .
Finally , governments should ues the space properly , like making plans before set up building , estimating the effects to human and animals .
Most people would say that running is just the most annoying sport ever .
They would just do if they have to .
But I enjoy myself so much doing this sport even if it 's just running around .
Running keeps you fit in two ways as you get your body and you mind active and healthy .
Going for a run is the best way to get your mind free and to think about nothing .
Your blood is now able to circulate easily through your vanes .
Running will ever be my favorite sport !
I think I can be the right person for this job , I 'm really patient and I really liove to be with kids , play with them and taking care of them , I always have fun with them .
I have 6 youngest brothers , 4 girls and 2 boys and everytime my parents go out for a job interview , dinner , to the movies , etc .
I always stay home and take care of them , I invent games for them to have fun and they also can learn with them , sometimes I take them to the sports club I work on , I 'm a swimming teacher and on my freetimes on the afternoon I 'm with them in the pool having fun , playing and teaching them to swim .
I also know a lot of cooking because in junior high I took cooking leassons and I learned a lot of variety of plates and snaks .
Ihope you consider me for this job .
Thankyou for your time , have a good day !
Dear Barbara .
What a great new !
I am very keen on PC games too .
In fact you probably spend more money than you save , because you will want to buy all their catalogue .
Regarding your question I am playing " Trine 2 " since last week .
It has wizards , witches , knights , thieves , goblins , but it make you think too .
Wishing seeing you soon .
Faithfully yours .
My favourite sport are slalom .
Most of the people I know do n't know what you are doing if you are training slalom .
To ski well you need do push your body forward .
It should be a strait line trough your toes , knees and shoulders .
The body parts that help you to get a big angle is your toes , knees , hips and shoulders .
When you start training in course you need to think about were you turn .
You should do the turn before the stick so you can start next turn right after you pass the stick .
The best thing with this sport is the feeling .
It also fun because you can notice that you are getting better all the time .
In the first place I tell you who are the most important people in my life .
This is a question that I struggle to answer , but I have to claim the most important person in my life was and is my marvellous father .
He led me through the branch of life and taught me to know how is the best way to follow .
He is always on my mind even though he is not physically .
I must be honest and I have to comment about no less important people for me , as such my best friend .
He also cooks tasty meals and give me them .
To sum up , I have to say there are too many people in my life , but few person so kind like I just mentioned .
Many people think that you need much money to be happy .
My opinion is that a minimum of money is only necessary .
This should be enough to feel you happy like a comfortable blanket does .
It start with your work life .
At this moment you need money to acquire the necessary to build an happy life .
Also , if you get enough you will be able to acquire your own home to see your future family growing inside it .
One say that having money to buy the latest gadget feel you happy .
Actually , if it 's the case , the happiness will be only for a short time .
The time of the gadget fashion .
You need just the necessary to get an happy long life .
The urban myth that statues could move makes the contemporary people frightened .
And the Doctor Who , Sci - Fi TV series of BBC , exteriorized this terror from the Weeping Angels .
After Blink was broadcasted , it raised common fears about statues to tele - viewers in Britain and over the world .
According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine , Radio Times , the Weeping Angels were picked as the most scariest villain of the Doctor who twice by about half of respondents .
These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of Doctor , like the Daleks exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe or the Cybermen transforming all living things into cyborg .
To figure out the factors , uncanny theory is used .
Uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originated from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar .
This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - living as life - likeness .
In Blink , Weeping angels ' uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
It is hard to read the Weeping Angels ' thoughts and emotions from their ash - pale face .
They look unnatural , in spite of their similar appearances with human .
Usually , they tend to hide their face , since angels could not move free when they watch each other .
And expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre , due to the deficiency of pupil .
Also , their facial expressions are almost flat as dead pans .
These factors make angels more grotesque psycho - pass assassin .
Then , it seems that these statutes might lose their spirits , only when they got our gaze .
But when it comes to their interior factor , the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning unconscious physiological reaction into conscious one .
The angels move and attack free , only when people blink their eyes or turn around their sight away .
However , people blink their eyes several times a minute and they are hardly aware of blinking .
After the Doctor 's warning , they may not turn our back , look away , and blink as we are protagonists of the episode .
Because it seems like , if we do that , angels will come out from TV and attack us !
Then , strangely , blinking our eyes becomes conscious behaviour .
Moreover , there are good scene settings to make people not blink by immersing audience in that situation .
In several scenes , Weeping Angels , the lonely assassins , never shift their positions and postures , even though protagonists and supporting players blink , look away or turn their backs .
The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously .
At last , directors fade out the scenes flicking out the light bulb in basement for maximizing the threat of Weeping Angels !
At last , Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar .
After Sally , the heroine of Blink , takes the TARDIS key away from Weeping Angels in the deserted house , they shadow her quietly , as if they might be laid there for a long time .
For instance , the angels camouflage themselves as monument of tomb in grave yards , carvings of the cathedral on the streets , and ornamental carvings in front of an antique police office .
Consequently , it makes audience unfamiliar with their circumstances .
Then tele - viewers are terrified at the basis of their livelihoods and people grab up blankets tight !
She began to study at the prestigious University .
That was a great responsibility for her , as well as prestige .
Anna feared , that she would have difficulties to cope up with the expectations .
However , aquaintances of her , the students at the University , comforted her .
They assured Anna that she will be granted success due to her knowledge and diligence .
Her grandfather , first doctor in the family , was her authority .
The first step was made .
From now on , Anna would have to direct her attention to making grandfather proud of her degrees .
She intended to prove that medicine is suitable field of study for her .
It seems that the most popular sport in the whole world is football because it keep all people united so that is why I love this sport and not only because of that , but it makes me feel very excited and it involves a lot of emotion as well then Do you enjoy watching or playing football ?
Surprisingly when you are practicing this sport you improve your velocity and coordination too , so it could be an interesting point to taking up if you are not involved in it .
Personally what I can say is that practicing this sports make me feel strongly lively and not only when I am playing it , it also happens when I am watching it especially during the world cup .
Curiously there are many ways for taking care of yourself when you are taking up this sport so what I advise you to do is do some exercise before you go in the pitch , so it not only prevent you to suffer from spraid or other kind of injuries but maintain you active to keep your game level .
I am encouraging to those people who do not like practicing sport that it the best way to maintain your own health
In Japan , there are many rules are set in the Sento .
They are usually aiming to avoid the hygienic problems .
Potential issues such as rule violation and conflicts may be arose because the foreigners may not understand the rules .
Similarly , the high level of uncertainly avoidance and the low level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient and self - disciplined .
The main reason for Japanese that they always follow the rules is to respect and hope not to cause any confusion to other users .
Also , Japanese think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment .
As a result in Australia , conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) , people may usually emphasize in their self - satisfaction and think of themselves first instead of the public .
Consequently , the bathing pool may face the hygienic problems , such as someone does not wash before bathing , and scrambling issues .
A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration .
Rental cost is also a limitation as it is relatively higher in Australia .
It is not only one of the most important monuments in the whole country but also a beautiful place to visit .
It is a majestical castle conviniently located on the river .
It 's a huge breath - taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens .
The place is fascinating , because it is loaded with history and nice to spend a day and relax in royal gardens .
I also recommend going to the vaults under the cathedral , where since the 16th century many kings and famous Polish people have their graves .
The Wawel Royal Castle is an obligatory place to see , while visiting Poland .
It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners are coming to Poland just to see the Cracow city and among other things the Wawel Castle .
I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit , because it is beautiful , full of other worth - seeing monuments , cute small cafes , various choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside .
I hope you will describe your impressions about the city after visiting it .
I 'm looking forward to a response from you .
Yours faithfully
Evidences show that many natural system have been affected by climate changes , particularly by temperature raises .
I think it is time we start taking environmentally friendly attitudes to help the planet .
First of all , as dioxides and carbons gases have been increasing ozone pollution worldwide in big cities , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative usages of transportation .
In addition , water pollution is , as well , a global problem , as so many industries dump a large amount of waste into rivers and lakes and also human waste and rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be done by improving recycling , waste disposal and even , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moreover , life may not be possible for the future generations , unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy , like green , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency avoiding side effects to the planet .
To conclude , I firmly believe that we can reduce damages and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .
During the lesson I have been very impressed by Socrative ( www.socrative.com ) , therefore I decided to devise a quiz about HTML and CSS .
The teacher ask the students to comment on the results and the activity , and discuss the opportunity to repeat the activity .
This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant , which is situated in the heart of Cannes on the seashore .
Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the sea .
The main course may consist of a risotto with fish , which can be really thrilling .
It might be followed by a delicious mousse au chocolat served in a large glass as a perfect ending .
All the products are fresh and the chef takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
In addition to it the service well accompanies the high quality of the cooking .
Michael came back from the school after a tedious day .
His brother Paul had been searching something in his bedroom and it seemed to be a completely mess .
Suddenly , Michael saw his brother crying and he asked him " where is my playstation ? ? " . said Paul inconsolably and he run to the kitchen .
Maybe someone came in their house and stole the game console !
When both of them started to search clues around the house they did n't found out anything interesting , but after a while , they had seen several pawprints and in that moment Michael remembered a fact : He had been forgotten his dog inside the house but the puppy had disappeared !
Obviously he knew their dog Spooky had been in Paul 's bedroom taken his playstation .
As they were looking for it in the garden they realised the console was near a tree .
Surprisingly Spooky turned up and escaped with some keys in his mouth but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Vividly as the picture depicts , there are six steps to produce bank notes .
First of all , they are supposed to be desighed with great care and considerations , such as the background colour , artwork and security issues , all of which are crucial for notes .
Secondly , skilled machinists will make preparations for metal plates that are one of the most vital ways to ensure the quality of bank notes .
In this step , special ink will be used for the images , slightly raised on the notes .
Next , it will come to the most improtant step , inspection .
If they are good quality sheets or partially damaged , but still in good condition , they will be packaged and dispatched .
On the other hand , if they are bad sheets or in bad condition , they will be disposed securely .
I hope the charity event you 've organised with your school was successful .
I was very inspired by your idea and decided to organize an even with charity club members in my school as well .
Now that we have a wonderful idea I thought you would want to hear about it .
We decided to organize a play and donate the money we earn to a Dog Foundation .
We tried to involve many students as possible since we needed actors , costume designers and technicians .
Hope you liked my idea and looking forward to hear from you soon .
Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would have additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
I might put on a mirror on the interior side of one of the wardrobe doors .
Well , I have already explained in detail how I would decorate two of the room sides , so now I am going to tell you what there would be in the two remaining walls .
First and foremost , though , I have to say that I am eager reader ; that being said , it may be obvious why I value space so much : I need a place to put my books in .
On the other hand , aside from my bedroom , I would love to have my own reading nook , where to read peacefully .
So , if my mental estimates are correct , there should still be enough space available to also place a little armchair , where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my chair desk , not very far from the window .
Oh !
As far as television is concerned , well , being honest , I haven't been watching much TV for years .
So , at most , I would put on a fourteen inches one on the top of one of the bookcases .
Secondly , my idea is putting on , at least initially , two lamps : a white overhead one and a red desk one .
Regarding the desk is just beside the bed , the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head ; that way , placing another lamp in the furniture would be unnecessary .
Lastly , I could consider also putting on a standard lamp near my reading armchair , but I would need to actually set up and use my dream bedroom to see if it is really worth it .
Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted of a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colours as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than they .
I sincerely doubt that I painted the furniture , though , so they would display the colour of the wood they would be made from .
Lastly , I would like that my curtains were red , given that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
I think a family matters much for everybody .
We do n't choose parents and children , but we can choose a good husband or a wife .
My parents divorced when I was 16 years old , so I do n't have close relations with my mom and dad .
Although I 'm very grateful to my mom for great support in the most difficult time of my life .
I 'm rather a friend to him than a strict mother .
He does not conceal anything from me as I try to understand what he really needs and support him .
My husband is also my best friend as I do n't have anybody closer than he .
I 'm happy as I have always dreamt of such a family .
I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities convenient to everyone .
Despite private car is more convenient to its owner then public transport , it is not in use the majority of time and that means wasting city space for parking while it could be used as a public space .
At the same time it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously .
For instance network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of personal car and work - load of public transportation .
Nowadays all the car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot - driven car that in future would resolve the issue of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week .
But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make a right choice ?
Unfortunately the main method is to make private cars if not a luxury then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation .
And underground , light tram system are still more ecological and fast .
The aim of this report is to describe the training course that I was attending last month , for a week and the activities in which I was involved during this period of time .
It turned up to be a disadvantage for me , given that I am interested in the theory .
I realised there is no time to think too much when it comes to practice , because you have to act quickly and to prove yourself and the others that you use your knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .
The efficiency is one of the most important things in terms of time management .
I would strongly recommend this training course on time management , considering is useful not just to gain some theory aspects for those who want to be more organised , but also if you want to really manage in a daily situation .
As I 've told you I was helping on the Linkin Park 's concert last month and I have to write you something about it .
You may thought that I met them or I got an autograph but I must disappoint you .
But I love this experience , I was really enjoying it .
When we came the manager gave the tickets to us and told us to be nice .
We stood in the entrance and when the clock struck six there just appeared thousands of people .
It does n't seem but it was hard work but after the concert the manager praised us for doing good job .
And guess what was the best thing about it !
You can imagine that it was amazing , Linkin Park is the best group I know so I was really enjoying it .
It 's unforgettable experience and it gave me a lot .
Yours faithfully
This picture illustrates the process of producing cash .
The first step is to design the looking of the bank notes and then prepare skilled machinists for metal plates .
The next step is the most important and it involes inspection , which means good and bad sheets are separated during this process .
Those good quality sheets are cut into individual notes and dispatched after packing and those bad sheets and notes are destroyed out of secutity aspect in the very last process .
Overall , the whole process of making bank notes has six steps and they are design , metal plates ' preparation , printing , inspection , dividing sheets into three groups and distribution or disposal .
I am not at all agree with that .
No future for the public transport ?
, of course there is future for it and every day more and more .
Green house gases have put a red light warning on the planet , and countries around the world are starting to realize the importance of reducing these gases .
One of the measures that we , as world citicens , can take is to leave our cars at home and start to take public transport or to share cars with others .
Big cities are crowd with vehicles and as result levels of pollution are dangerously increasing .
This is developing diseases and alergies that are affecting the citicens .
That is why , many cities has close their centres to private cars and only allows public transport .
Enginers are studying new engines that are more nature friendly , but even so , we have to reduce vehicles to help reduce green house effects and pollution .
Plans and programmes are being developed to reduce the number of cars driving throuhgt the cities .
Some of these oave the same destinations .
Use public transport is a way to be green and help to improve our planet and that is a very important task for all of us .
In recent years , public transport is really common in our lives .
From the Metro system , the bus , the train , and the high speed rail , all these public transportation become more and more popular .
Lots of people really enjoy the moment when taking public transportation because they are more convenient , cost less and more eco - friendly .
We do n't have to drive by ourselves , and we do n't have to think which way we should go to reach the destination .
Additionally , taking public transport cost less .
Compared to driving a car , it only cost us about 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 dollars for one single travel .
We have to pay for the oil if we drive and we all know that the oil price goes up every year .
As a result , I think more people will prefer to take public transport rather than driving due to the high price of the oil .
Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time which leads to greenhouse effect and the rise of the average sea level .
Taking public transport can effeciently reduce the emmission of carbon dioxides and will help the earth to recover from those disorders .
So , as a member living in our mother earth , we should do our best to protect her .
The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statemant that the public transport ha no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Can you imagine a transportation which never appears ?
You may think of the time machine , it would only be seen on movie .
However , it wo n't be probably be invented after all .
Since a century , many transports have been invented , therefore our lives become convenient .
What transportation do we need and should be invented now is hard to think , because no place we could n't go .
I think the transport nowadays are perfect .
Although the public transport is enough for people need , it can be improved its function .
For example , the speed of transportation can become faster , using green energy sources , improved the capacity of the public transportions and so on .
With the advance of technology , a lot of problems have come to pass , the natural resources are becoming in storted , and the air pollution is getting worse .
So , we have to consider how to improve theses problems for our next generation .
Learning of another language is very useful these days , because of globalization and also cooperation between countries .
It is importatnt when we work or study in international area .
Firstly I would like to write about benefits .
People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their life .
It can have influence at their work .
They can have better position , work for foreign company , communicate with foreign companies etc .
It can be the benefit at school as well , because if you need some information for some project , you can look at foreign literature too .
Also you can be part of travelling and working experience which can offer to you your school .
If you want to try this option , you need to have a very good level of particular language .
It is very good that these days schools offer you more languages for learning to choose from and they recommend learning at least 2 foreign languages .
Of course it can be different in each country .
Another very important benefit of learning new language is that you can travel you will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them .
It helps you to ask people on many important information which you need during your journey .
For example , which way you should go , where is good restaurant , how to travel in a country , how to solve your problems , where is the cheapest accommodation and much more .
Thanks of learning another language you can have also friends from all the world and you can better understand the culture of new country .
I think that there is not many disandvantages of learning another language .
One of them can be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them .
It can be really interrupting if it still continues .
And sometimes maybe you do not want to hear what are people speaking about in foreign language .
In conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will be always important for today 's people and new generation too and in addition it will increase need to communicate in another language .
It 'll be a pleasure reporting that the tests were passed with flying colors , for that I ask for your help .
You told me that you have a shared folder with some learning tools to pass this exam .
I 'm afraid because I think that the next exam in March could be a bit soon , but if I could have a look to some tools I 'll be relaxed .
Also , I found some books on the internet with Crambridge 's exams .
With the process of the globalization , people are eager to know the other country than ever .
In the past , most people consider the museum as the best way to get along with the unfamiliar land .
First , as the technology developed , we may find visiting museum is far from convenient .
People using new technique has gradually constitued the majority .
The online visiting is a good point in this case .
The Forbidden City , one of the most famous museum in China , has opened its online version to the public , which means people can visit the Forbidden City on the Internet instead of taking a time - consuming flght to Beijing where the museum locates .
It leads to an increasing number of people choose to using the online museum .
On the other hand , needless to say , the limitation of museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings , it is far from an enjoyable visiting when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and no touch .
The scenery , the beauty of mountain and river , can only be enjoyed when you travel there on youe own .
Once I visited the museumm finding some pictures of the cave painting in France , but when I got France to see the real painting , I found it is more vivid and can show you how great the France caveman who painted it .
Admittedly , the museum has its owm merits;it is easy to find on the map and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country .
However , more often than not , the high price of the ticket of the museum can ruin the fun when you get to the coutry .
A documentary , a book about the culture is cheap and easy.we can consider it a ecomomical method .
Visiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw about a country , but not a best way anymore .
If you decide to find some information about a totally unknowed land , the museum is not a wise option .
That sounds a little bit like a name of any sci - fi or horror .
Will our houses look so terrible in a 40 years ?
Or will they be made from iron and have strong door and barred windows ?
But do n't panic , let 's think rationally .
With technology we will clean our house , technology will protect us , with technology we will spend our free time .
In every room we will have a big screen , where we 'll be able to see , where are our children and if everything 's ok .
Our fridge will tell us to buy a fresh milk , if there 's no left .
Our bed will tell us when to go sleep .
Machines can tell us lots of imporatant information .
I think it 's something nobody wants , but it can comes true .
But maybe they could stop talk to each other , because it 's waste of time too .
I hope , It will never happen .
As you know I 'm planning to go to England to brush up on my English .
I really appreciate it if you could give me a piece of advice about what course should I take .
I 'd like you to take into account the following requirements .
Firstly , my main target is to improve speaking and writing skills as I do n't feel confident enough to do such tasks .
Selected college should be used to teaching these matters properly .
As far as accommodation is concern I 'd like bed and breakfast included in the price .
Finally , my overall budget amount 900 pounds .
If it 's not please let me know .
Summer camping is all about providing fun activity in a safe environment .
Creating fun activities is an important role of the summer camp workers .
As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7 - 10 years , I have the ability to create and perform fun activities .
In the last summer , my kids and I created a fun morning and afternoon program for our neighbors we called it " multi - balls multi - fun " .
In the morning program , the kids have enjoyed playing football , soccer ball , basketball and water ball .
The program has included many competitive activities that full of fun and cheerful .
In the afternoon , the kids have enjoyed a multi - dance program that has different international dances .
the kids have loved learning new dances and cultures
while designing fun activities , the camp workers have to take in concerns the safety level for these activities , the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed .
I used to assess and treat many injured kids during my work journey in many hospitals .
In addition , I have the experience in providing the basic , the advanced life support , and the airway protection .
While these situations are rare , they need an effective fast intervention to save kids ' lives .
In conclusion , I think providing fun in safe environment is the main component in summer camp that each family is looking for . as a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun , to provide safe activities and the most important is my ability to intervene in the emergency situations
The interior is spectacular because it is decorated as the film of Hollywood .
The tables and the chairs are very beautiful because they are as in the American films but they are very inconfortable .
The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed but always it is crowded .
I love this restaurant because the food is really good is the tastiest food that I have eaten .
My favourites dishes are the " Nachos " and " Catarapi " , the second is a dish of spicy pasta , it is spectacular .
The service is very fast I believe the people eat good and fast .
The price is a bit expensive , but it is a great place for lunch or dinner with the friends .
I think this restaurant would be suitable for us because it is a great place for all , it is in the center and the most important her food is really tasty .
So I always recommend go .
We can get a lot of up to date information around the world through watching television .
There are many channels on TV , not only entertainment but also technology , health , environment , weather forecast and news channel , etc .
News on TV tell us what is happening in the world .
Health channels give the ways of living with healthy lifestyle .
Weather forecast points out to prevent from violent storm , rain , snow , etc .
Discovery channel is the knowledge bank and animal planet is very interesting .
Moreover , nowadays many education channels are developing to help the students .
Mathematics , English and environmental knowledge Quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children .
We can also improve our moral attitude by watching the discussion and speech by the outstanding leaders .
So , I think advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the watching person .
We can make good use of time from TV and we can also waste time with some useless channels .
So , we need to try to get equal balance between entertainment and education from TV .
By doing this , we can gain bird eye view without much effort .
I am a qualified educator and I have worked with children for five years .
I have also taught English to Spanish pupils so language will not be a problem .
Although I only know dishes from my country , I could learn more about your meal because cooking is one of my favourite hobbies .
I always work with many children , so I have experience managing and organising groups .
About my personal characteristics , I am friendly and self - confident but I have another quality that children loves : I am really creative , I can make costumes with not many materials so they will enjoy a lot dressing them up .
I usually play sports like tennis or running but specially I am interested in living adventures , and I would like we could live this one together .
I enclose my CV to complete information .
I am glad about having good news from you , it has been a whole year since we talk the last time .
I 'm so happy you are almost finishing school and of course that you are coming to Colombia .
As I told you once , Colombia has a lot of amazing places where you can have fun , met new people and learn all about our
It would be incredible if you start your trip in Cartagena which is a caribean and tropical city .
and you can spend some quality time on the beach or walking by the old city .
Then you can go to Santa Marta , do some water sports , visit Taganga where you can find the best shrips in the whole area .
Thereafter , you should go to Medellín , in that time of the year they will be celebrating some typical holidays .
So , you will be able to live and watch all this amazing exotic flowers , to hear Colombian music and see typical dances .
After that , you need to come to Bogotá . I am going to be happy about having you here .
I can show you the downtown , some of the most important museums like " La Casa del oro " or The national Museum .
Then , we can go out for a party night at the west of the city .
To finish , if you want to , you can be an English tutor at my University for the whole time you are going to stay in the city .
By the way , my boyfriend will finish PhD program this summer :-) , and then he needs to do compulsory military service begin 7th August for one year .
Fortunately , he is assigned to substitute services , so he does n't to enter real army .
We think that will be convenient for him to apply the Postdoctor position during the period of military service .
His ideal plan is he will try to apply the Postdoctor position this fall or winter , and then he can work abroad after finishing the military service ( August 2015 ) .
To take public transport or not that is a question . Travelling by car is convenient , however , it
ignores the car congestion problems and the pollution for the CO2 .
Yet , to me public transport is my
Public transport reduce the car congestion problems .
Since the public transport , it decrease people
work or travelling by car .
For example , taking the train form Taipei , the city in Taiwan , to Taoyuan in the newyear just costs half an hours in contrast nearly two hours awing to the car congestion in the highway .
Besides , take the train instead of car may make a new friends possibly if chats with others besides the seats .
Therefore , public transport is the best option to me .
In terms of protecting environment , taking the public transport may cut down the carbon emmittion .
Because there are nearly 70 billions people in the world if everyone travelling by car even the half , the pollution will be the burden to the world .
It is the urgent timing to avoid greenhouse problem that people should think how to decrease the carbon emmition .
To be brief , taking the public transport is not only avoid congestion problems to save the time but benefit our mother nature future .
Admittedly , travelling by the car has its merits such as more convenient to everywhere we want , can enjoy the time with family in car .
Nevertheless , it cost a lot of problems and pollution .
For the better life and world why not take public transport .
Tom was so happy because he finally won the prize .
He attended in a local motorcycle race and won the 5000 $ cash prize .
He did his best for this race .
Three consecutive years he attended in the local race but at most he could get the second rank .
This year he found a good trainer and 6 months training made him fully ready for this race .
He went to coffee shop .
In there he saw an old man who asked him for help .
The old man said to him my son needs surgery today or he will die .
Tom asked him the cost of surgery .
The old man answered 20,000 $ .
Tom asked him about the insurance and the old man said the insurance only pays 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease .
Tom told I can give you 5000 $ but what can I do for the rest of this amount ?
He thought I should perform a show to jump over the several wrecked cars but it was too risky because he had not any experience in this kind of show .
Moreover , he needs some people to advertise for the show .
Jack said I know someone who can do that but how we organize the show .
We need advertising and to find a suitable place for show until 3 pm .
Tom called his friends and asked them to advertise by any means they can and also he requested his trainer to talk to the owner of the race road .
It was 5 pm and too many people came to see the show .
Tom yelled : ladies and gentlemen , please help us as much as you can because all of the income of this show is paid for surgery of a sick boy .
Tom sold all of tickets quickly and earned enough money .
The old man became very excited and glad .
His son was cured and in recovery room Tom visited him and they became friends .
Although it had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
A short - term and enticing Russian loans are very attractive for Serbian politicians who are struggling with the financial difficulties .
Because of the quicker effects they are more lucrative for the elite than the long - term reforms required by the EU .
As an Orthodox and Slavic country which is yet to become a member of the EU and does not want to become member of NATO , in a difficult economic situation with public exposed to strong propaganda , Serbia , is an easy target of Russia 's soft power .
People were changing during ages and in the same time they were building astonishment history .
They were thinking how the world would look like and with that thought civilization was created .
Nowadays we are in the same situation .
Future is one of the biggest question for us .
Our curiosity is not restraining .
I want to give an example how would look like the Home of the Future .
The first question is where our homes would be located .
There are a lot of places where people are setting theirs houses , perhabs we will be living under water ?
Many buildings like skycarpers are suggesting living in flats which exist above the ground and it is not extraordinary , but how about whole cites prospering under the water with it own source of light which could replace the Sun .
Likewise location , something which could change are the materials with which we will build houses .
Despite the fact that visual aspect is the most important thing to most people in my opinion in this case everything was said and no new forms could be created .
To summarize the Home of the Future will bring us not only a new kind of home , but also a new outlook on life .
The book is called " Living Through a Natural Disaster " written by Eve Recht .
The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters , for instance , the Cyclone Tracy in Darwin , Australia ; the Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America etc .
The book is also very readable , not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply gives us an overview of handling natural disasters , so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon .
The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is that the people who live along the Yellow River , how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and make a better solution .
It became a mass killer and make people homeless .
However it made the situation worse .
After day of heavy rain , the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed can not withstand the water when it out of its limitation .
The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas .Fortunately , the flood also makes the plains fertile and feed millions of people .
While I was flip - flopping through the pages , I let my imagination run wild with the story .
Let 's think about how we treated our mother of nature before .
Now she is extremely angry after human beings did something really hurt to her .
After all , she is very kind - hearted and always helps us have a good living .
Even though the mother of nature is complicated sometimes , she would give us a light of hope .
She never just shuts one door , and she also opens another one .
According to what Charles Dickens said , " it was the best of times " , because the people can get rewarding from the nature and get a better life because of the fertile land which can feed us .
People will continue suffering the dangerous floods and there is no end after many years unless the government take an effective action to stop flooding .
It is arduous for people living in devastating surroundings .
My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people in the Yellow River .
I sincerely recommend this book to everybody who wants to broaden their horizons and know more than you have known already .
The World Cup , Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations .
For example , North and South Korea are two countries against each other , but every year they still have a friendly football match .
During that time , the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship .
The fans , supporters shout , they even cry together .
The sports game events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between the nations .
Sometimes the sports games are full of tensions over flow .
The patriotic emotions explode in unaggressive way .
For example , during the semi - final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia team , the players played quite violent , the supporters of the two teams were very tense .
Even after the end of the match assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams .
However , I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations .
During my tenure at the University of economics and Law , I have noticed my growing interest in marketing and public relations .
Last month , I interned at the Hoan My Medical Corporation in Ho Chi Minh City .
My position entailed developing marketing content on the web pages and slideshows publicizing the success of the society 's event .
The marketing departerment also gives me the responsibility of publicizing events via Facebook .
I believe that my experiences in marketing and interpersonal skills make me a prime candidate for this position . I am a diligent worker , and passionate about my work . I will be a valuable asset to your company and will use this as an opportunity to grow and further the development of my marketing skill set .
I will follow up within a week to confirm that all of my materials were received and hopefully set up an interview time .
If we watch how society is going nowadays , we notice some aspects that let us think about human condition .
First of all we can define ourselves " slaves of the technology " because now we all have a telephone that have lots of functions and that turn us away from real life .
This can be seen in teenagers , who seems to prefer to talk by telephone than " face to face " , and also in children , who prefer play with video games on their own than going to the park
In my opinion the obsession for the business trasforms society in a ring in which every man will be against his friend only for an excellent career .
The last point that has changed people 's life is the tendency to have the same thougths or the same goods .
In this way everyone is the perfect copy of someone else and the originality or a creative mind is considered as something bad .
There are also positive aspects , for example there is a progress in the subject of medicine or in the use of the eco - resources .
Will people 's life change again ?
Yes it will and I hope that we will improve our thought and we will have the cosciousness that we are not " supreme " and that we will never have the right of imposing us in the world .
Nowadays it is possible to listen to various types of music .
Taking acceptance the strength of music , it is hard to imagine human life without it . "
Music is the nutrition for our souls " said in the popular proverb .
To my mind , beautifulness of music does not depend on its sorts .
For example , there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which organized in many countries .
People almost from all over the world attends to participate in it .
Being the core of culture of a country , it influences on national fame .
For instance , in our country music consists of two main parts : Mougam and Folk music , which have been getting popularity from all regions in the world since it was sprung .
However , modern music is not always acceptable for different people .
Despite that it is held by the majority of countries .
To take account that it has been improving day by day , we can meet the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music almost in every country .
Most of the countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music .
Inasmuch as this process makes peoples close to each other encouraging them to corporate and befriend .
To sum up , it is necessary to point out that there is not any negativeness or perfectness of national or modern music at all .
But to begin with Anna for a long time was n't famous at school .
She prefer books , quiet places and that kind of thing , boring for elite in our school .
She always was the best student in the class or even in the school for a couple times .
She very focused on learning .
She was always involved with school trips connected with political places like court or government .
One a day she decided to pass away all of this thing and get started something completely different .
She became really popular in all school , everyone wanted to spend time with her .
She is pretty , smart and so nice for all people .
And for now she is one of the most popular models in the world not only in the school .
Day when Anna decided to be a model was the most important in her life .
I 'm very happy for reading your letter and that you come to my beautiful country .
I think that Spain is an incredible country since it has all kinds of landscapes : mountains , beaches , lakes , and you can enjoy adventure activivities , for example , trekking routes , climbing , bungee , surf ... You can make different tourism depending on the city where you want to go .
Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has a good weather all year .
However , I recommend travelling to Extremadura in Spring or Autumm because in summer it is too hot .
In Extremadura you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfragüe Nacional Park or Tajo - International Natural Park .
Moreover , you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones ( I recommend you this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it ) or small natural lakes on the North of Extremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many towns and cities with an impressive ancient neighbourhood , for instance , Cáceres , Mérida , Trujillo , Guadalupe , Alcántara ...
Other places that I would recommend are : the towns of the South of Andalucia which have clean beaches , cold water and a good leisure with many restaurants , shops , parks , zoos , aquatic parks ...
On the other hand , near Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches which water is very clean and warm .
In particular , I recommend you to go to Baleares Islands .
In addition , you can visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches .
In the North of Spain the weather is colder than the rest of the country , for this reason , the water of the beaches is very cold and it is very difficult to swim there .
However , you must go and know these unforgettable places .
You say in the letter that you want to work for three months . I think that you can try look for a waiter job in the towns with beaches during the Summer months .
It is easier to find a job in the beach than finding it in the centre of Spain .
He took breakfast with his father that took him school , as he always do .
That morning , he had math and after he had a science class .
The first one was very boring for him because he was very tired and he was n't about listening everything that the teacher was saying .
Tom loves asking questions himself about life and thinks that science class is the only that can solve his questions .
Those questions are : Where and how do we come from ?
When science class arrived he felt really excited because John , the science teacher , told them that he was going to explain them a very interesting thing .
It was about what problems are we going to have in a few years if we do n't change anything related to contaminating our environment .
John talked about the serious problems there are caused by not recycling things as plastic bags , bottles … that end up floating in the sea because humans do n't take care of our environment , and all this is causing that loads of acuatic animals expire .
When Tom arrived home , talked to his family about what have he learned in science class and talked their parents to start recycling .
We have worked with Nikita for 1 year during my account management of Enter .
As AC category manager Nikita has demonstrated in - depth knowledge of AC market , high level of negotiations skills , and professional attitude to everything he did .
His advice helped me to increase sales of main e - retail partners .
Nikita has superior communication skills , positive mindset , and he is highly approachable .
I 'm absolutely confident to recommend Nikita as an experienced Product Manager .
I am Italian , 30 years old .
Due to my background I believe to be the ideal person for the abovementioned job .
I have been involved in summer camps with children from different background and diverse needs .
In particular , I have been dealing for 10 years with children with disabilities .
Such experience has been an eye - opener for me .
I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at the daily life with differnet eyes .
A few years ago , I had also the chance to work for 1 year in a school for disabled children and youth in a rural area of Ghana .
It was impressive to see the strength showed by those children .
Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core , children with disabilities were growing very independent and strong , despite all the challenges they could face on the way .
You do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition .
As volunteers we were also helping the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room .
Moreover , I had the chance to share with them the recipe of Italian pizza .
In conclusion , I believe to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it .
My experience with children from different ages and Countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your Esteemed Company .
Thanks in advance .
Sincerely ,
TENNIS AND NOTHING ElSE
WHY TENNIS
There seems to be nothing better , nothing more interesting , exhiliring , breathtaking or stunning just as taking up this sport .
It ca n't be compared to anything else if it comes to all emotions and feelings which are connected with playing tennis .
Being on the court , it appears to be funny , gives me a feeling of fulfilment .
Not everybody knows how much devotion and determination requires being a good player .
You just surely have to work your fingers to the bones but it 's definitely worth .
It 's also not said but tennis is one of sports which causes an enermous amount of injuries , so that 's necessary to be under constant control of your doctor !
Despite all obstacles , I would n't change this entertainment on anything else .
The amount of pleasure which I can get it 's simply incomparable to anything else .
If I were to start my new sport career , I would choose a good medical care at fist .
Maybe it 's not a vital part of being a well known sportsman but it 's important when you want to work something off during your career .
The second thing , it 's a quality of an equipment .
There are a lot of bergains and cheap items on the market , which very often catches our eye but I want definitely warn you against it !
Do n't be mean and spent as much money as it 's needed .
I hope that you wo n't hesitate any more and that you start playing tennis at the moment !
The Home of the Future - in what ways homes will be different in the future and in what ways will be the same ? I think that is many reasons to consider both of this options .
In terms of differences is that this houses will be modern , more secure , economic .
Most of the furnishings will be a machine and domestic activities will be done for us .
However , they will lose the atmosphere of houses with antique furniture and interior , which create the unique and familiar atmosphere .
Surely people who will live in House of the Future .
When I first watched the game between Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions I was in stuck .
It seems like a bunch of armed men is trying to beat each other asses .
And one lucky receiver tries to deliver to the end zone .
First of all it 's a man sport , simple and simultaneously complicated .
To be a fan of NFL team is very special experience .
It 's the great show , by the way .
If you enter the world of NFL brutality , rivalry and love you should know that you stay here forever .
If you plan to play this game you definitely should be an outstanding athlete . You should understand " pros " and " cons " of every move you make on the field .
And of course you should be a team player .
As they say " There 's no I in " team " , but there 's " I " in win " .
So it is what it is .
I 'm friendly , open mind and quite easy going guy who live in one of the most beautiful city of Russia - St. Petersburg .
I love my city and I love to travel , try a new things , socialize and experience a new cultures .
Working as IT engineer , I can afford 2 - 4 short term trips per year , and I always take this chance .
I can show you cool places step apart from beaten path in my hometown .
Since I have full - time job I could join you at weekends .
I would like to meet new friends all over the world and have a great time together .
I can share my knowledge about Finland and other countries .
I would like to help people in my best way I can .
I would like to learn from others about the world , people , cultures and idiomas and share this knowledge with others and be helpful in return :)
Vienna contains a lot of great shopping areas , that is why I am going to speacialse on the three most popular places .
Conclusions
I would like to start of with one of the most renownedly malls - called " Donauzentrum " .
It covers about 60 shops .
The Entertainment section stays open after the mall closed .
On the countryside you can find the recently edified mall named " G3 " .
The " Mariahilferstraße " is the perfekt place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls .
This street is one oft the most popular shopping streets of Vienna .
Even the most extravagant shops can be found there .
It is not only worthy to attend the street by day but also by night .
Beside the shops some nice bars and restaurants can be found .
To not to lose the track I am going to give review .
Espacially on a rainy afternoon the " Donauzentrum " and " G3 " are the prefekt way to spend your day .
To people who prefer spending their time on the countryside I would commend a visit on the " Maria Hilfer Straße " .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm a 17 years old Italian student , I have a B1/2 English level , I 'm cheerful and hard working .
I 'm also a volonteer among the red cross association , so I 'm used to look after children and organise all kinds of events .
I think I 'm suitable for every work because I 'm sporty and sociable and above all I think I have enough willpower to manage and carry out every work you will choose to give me .
As I live in Milan , I hope you will answer soon , so if I have a positive feedback , I 'll have enough time to book the flight ticket .
I 'm happy to live here because the air is clean and fresh and we have o problems with the rubbish .
All the building here have been built to respect the environment , in fact every house has photovoltaic panels on the roof .
These panels are used to bring the light of the sun to produce electricity .
The first Sunday of every month , a group of volunteers goes in the parks of the village to clean it and to cut the grass .
Italy is famous for the typical food and culture rich of arts and history .
We all know that the Roman Empire affected a lot Italian culture and history , in fact if you want to go on a tour around the most beautiful cities in the country , you should definitely go to Florence , Venice , Naples and many others ..
You will be able to see ancient and modern building such as theatres , churches , cathedrals and civil buildings built by the most famous artists in the entire world !
They will not only see one type of history but many because Italy , for many centuries , had an important function for exchanges and commerce .
So , I think that both hobbies has their advantages and disadvantages .
If I were you , I will give up with sport , because I think that music classes can help you to impress a girl .
But , on the other hand , sport helps you to keep your muscles in tonus .
But you know , decision is your and I can just somehow effect on it .
Hope to hear from toy soon .
Many people feel that learning English especially in ' England ' or in ' The USA ' , is better than learning that in a country that does not have English as its mother tongue .
For instance , in Peru everybody speaks Spanish so you are not accustomed to the language .
The advantages of learning English abroad are the everyday practice , which you should have if you are in an English country and all the people who you get to know from all the world .
One argument in favour of this idea is that Peruvian people who learn English for a short period and then travel abroad , have an enhancement in just one or two months .
Also , you can suffer from jet - lagged if you travel a long distance .
In conclusion , I am of the opinion that people ought to study abroad if they have the opportunity , so apart from your lessons you can interact with native people and learn usually - common phrases .
She knew that her eighteen birthday approach and she will spend them and all the preceding week with her friends in Spain .
They had to fly next Monday and go back next Sunday .
Her birthday was in Friday and they all wanted to go that night to the greatest club in Barcelona to have some fun .
Other girls left out earlier because they prepared something special for her .
But before she went to the club , she was invited for one drink with lifesaver from the hotel 's pool .
Then the people from the hotel saw her last time .
She did not appear in the club , and she did not come to the hotel on consecutive days .
Her friends came back to their country but Anna still is missing .
Her parents and her sister still looking for her .
If you want to meet somebody strange , do not leave your friends or family without knowledge with who and where you want to go .
People travel less in public vehicles these days .
Many thinks that life of public transport is going to end .
I believe that it is true because the people are more concerned about their privacy and time taken to travel by the public transport .
In this essay these worries are studied carefully .
Private vehicle offers more privacy than public vehicle .
For example , If she is sitting on a bus , she could n't feed her child because people sit in the nearby seats they may gaze at her .
On a hot day the lady ca n't remove her coat to reduce body heat .
For example , A lady travel on a bus and if she removes her coat everybody will look at her and probably tease her but in her car she can do what ever she want .
Hence , the private vehicles give enough privacy and comfort for a family .
The public transport may take more time to travel and have rigid schedule than private vehicles .
A car can be drove very fast in order to reduce the time taken to travel .
In case a person who is going for an interview for a job , punctuality is a must , hence he can drive his car fast or can go earlier in his car to reach there early .
But he could not travel on a bus very fast in order to reach destination very quickly .
Because public transport have a fixed timetable .
Hence public vehicles take more time to travel .
In conclusion , usage of public transportation is reducing day by day .
People are getting anxious about their privacy and the trip time .
In order to boost the usage of public transport the government or the governing body should consider these factors and must find a solution to these problems .
The technology has changed us much faster and more dramatic than we used to think .
Nowadays all of what we need is a full charged smart phone with the Google Map application .
In the past people could only have a purchase from store to store by themselves , now we can browse almost hundreds of goods on line and buy it through a simple click .
For this tremendous outcome I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , with greater extension to every aspect of our lives .
In my imagination , the future would be more messy and crowded with less species of creature but more of us , the human beings .
We will face the more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental pollution .
Some of the countries will be submerged entirely into the sea , some will survive , and less space for increasing people .
Fortunately the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living , to clean air for breathing , and to purify water and food for supply .
Other than the situation I mentioned above , we will have our memories and knowledge being replicate in the form of digital data .
We can access all the knowledge from the Internet as we need .
When we have a dementia ( a steady degeneration disease of our brains ) we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of on - line " Big Cloud " memories .
No longer do we suffer from studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we known though the linkage to the huge database online .
We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects to our personalities .
Moreover , our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns even the physical functions corresponding to the changing environments or simply by our specific commands .
However , the more we feel convenient , the more damages to our intellect .
We do n't have to think too much about almost everything , needing no person to company with since we have all these distractive devices for joy and relaxation .
The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of these unrealistic convenience we have .
It sounds like a scary science fiction , but it may happen if we keep pursuing only values of materials .
What thing the most important is to set a right direction for the future of us .
For example , saving the endanger wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient .
Nonetheless , we have to confront the truth that the resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly .
The top 50 riches in the world hold most of the power to control the direction of our future .
Currently there are many means to transport , but if we talk about long distances , remain the most popular trains , planes and boats .
however you ca n't travel by train when you want to cross the sea .
It is faster than the two , it is no difficult to travel on it and it is quite comfortable .
Also you can travel to different places and longer distances while boating , for example , you can only travel to places where connection to the sea .
In short , plane is one of the best options to do it .
I 'm really glad to know about your future plans , I definitley think that this year of travelling and discoverying will be a great way to grow up , meet new people of different cultures .
If I have the opportunity to help you in your organization , please no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Firstly I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital , which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites such as museums , art galleries , monuments and churches .
Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture , the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts , exhibitions , festivals and so on !
From the main capital you can easily travel by train or plane and reach in a few hours all the major cities both in the North and in the South of the country .
As you arrive during the summer , you should then have a vacation in the South where the beaches are breathtaking , with such a clean water and golden long shores .
In connection with your desire to find a job , you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field : as you wrote , you 're searching for a monthly job and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly fit your expectations .
By the way , a friend of mine runs an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking forward to an English native speaker who could help him with his foreign guests .
If you are interested , I could give you his phone number and e - mail so that you two are able to speak about the matter and maybe find an agreement .
I graduate from AL - mustansiria University / collage of Arts / department of Translation in 1998 .
I started my work for the Ministry of Oil as senior translator in 2000 .

Which inspire me to study Translation that considers science and art in the same time .
I pursued my life dream of higher education by searching the best universities in UK .
I found your Translation and Interpretation program for master degree meets my requirements and needs .
Since my graduation I acquired wide experience in translation .
After my graduation .
I spent two years in translation hundreds of assays in different fields for higher education students .
In 2000 .
I work in the OIL MINSIRTY 's central library on foreign scientific books which concerned mainly in petroleum filed .
This gives me wide knowledge in petroleum jargons that open endless horizons of experience and how to work on developing my knowledge and skills .
My enriched experience in English language and my knowledge in petroleum expression qualified me to work in Training and Developing Directorate mainly in abroad training .
I did many important translations for training manuals and petroleum institutions student description .
As well as , the higher administration in Training & Developing directorate selected me to join focal committee to buildup competency system for petroleum staff in corporation with the British government .

I did IELTS exam twice and scored ( 5.5 ) .
In spite of that I did not give up .
I intend to study in your university in the pre session courses to meet your standard in English language .
All the above mention crystallized my ambition in continuing higher education in a respected university .
I intend to specialize in translation that concerned with the petroleum sector .
It goes without saying that I am form petroleum country and I intend to work in OPEC as representative of my country and enhance the Ministry of Oil translation staff with highly educated translators .
I plan to give hand the freshman translators in the Ministry to precede their career under my supervision by couching and mentoring them .
I am sure that you will give me hand in realizing me dream by giving me the right direction to make my dream come true .
At first you should visit sights like a churches and a cathedrals then move to the town centre and go through the town park .
There you will find beautiful countryside and gorgeous swans , which stay there for the whole year .
I can recommend you to visit the library .
It 's quite architecturally significant building I think , plus there is about million books , so you can learn something new about our culture .
There is a pub called Richard 's . You can easily find it because it 's huge green building just next to the library .
There you can taste our national cuisine bud also their international cuisine is tasty .
Just do not order the pancakes , because they do really bad pancaces .
If I were you I would ordered the shots of alcohol because there is a toy train which will deliver the shots to you .
You can also go to the club .
I go to the A 's quite often , about once per month , but I have never been in the Barrel so I ca n't tell you , what it is like .
So if you will go to the A 's you will find it by the lights .
In front of the building are enormous reflectors which shines into the darkness .
Not far from the town lies zoo .
There are about thousand of animals and in the midlle of it is located a gorgeous castle .
Charles Dickens and Emily Bronte are both Victorian writers .
Their novels have much in common : first of all the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heighs by E. Bronte ) , and so are the characters , which are always well described especially on a psychological level ; furthermore both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class .
There is also a lot in contrast , most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities while Emily prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , in fact Charles mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of lower classes and the bad consequences of the industrialisation , instead Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prude .
Then we can notice that the narrator of the novel has different roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient , Emily 's one is part of the story itself and can change revealing characters ' perspectives .
We feel happier during the conversation when someone who has a good sense of humor .
Some people agree with that a good sense of humor is not one of the most important human qualities .
However , others disagree with it .
This is because people who have a good sense of humor can bring joy for others .
Also , people could have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor .
First , people who have a good sense of humor can make others to laugh .
For example , my friend , Jane , talks lots of jokes to let us laugh out loud .
We like to talk to her because she always can bring happiness to us .
Also , we can forget lots of annoying things from our work .
Second , people can make a friend easier when they have a good sense of humor .
Also , after people talked to her , they always wanted to talk to my mother again and are eager to be her friends .
In this case , people who have humor can make a friend easily .
Third , sometimes a person who has humor can help others to overcome some difficult issues .
To illustrate , my niece did not get a great score in his test .
My niece had courage after his mother talked to him .
To sum up , people who have a good sense of humor can bring happiness to people .
Furthermore , sometime people with a sense of humor can help others to conquer the difficult issues .

As we know every person wants to get success in their respective lives .
For this they must possess a healthy life .
Outdoor games are made only for this purpose that is to make a person healthier .
In ancient times every child loved to play games outside their homes and they were more stronger than children in today 's world .
There are many games that children can play like : cricket , badminton , football etc .
Our world 's great scientist have invented internet to solve various distant problems .
Students start forgetting their physical games and got stuck in this internet world .They are giving so much time in using internet and they do only baseless gossips on social networking websites .
If they want to use it they should try to focus on getting important information which is benefial in improving their knowledge skills .
Using internet in wrong manner may affect their studies and health as well .

Dear Manager of the Summer Cam , USA ,
I am writing to you to request if I may be considered a place in your program .
I contain all the characteristics in which you require and so is an ideal person for the job .
Firstly , you should choose me due to the fact that I can talk English very fluently .
I 've taught at many schools including primary so I got a good encounter of children .
As I 've also ran the marathon THRICE and play in the local netball team I am quite energetic plus I 'm also hardworking as I try my best to reach my ambition .
I 'm very cheerful to and I rarely lose my temper .
Also I 'm a good cook ; at one school I 'd taught at we made cheese and pepperoni pizzas !
As a result I am also organised .
I am always punctual . I 'll be good at preparing all the events as I am- as I already told you- organised .
Finally , to conclude my letter I just want to say : Please choose me !
I will make summer camp a much better place to be in !
country , Indonesia , is full of natural attraction .
It is an archipelago , surely many spots of tourism here .
Beach , island , culture , and culinary are the common interest to explore here .
If you would like to see wonderful beach , you could come to Bali , Lombok , Sulawesi or Irian Jaya island .
If I can say , beaches in those islands are more beautiful and natural than in Java island .
If you choose to travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali , the trip will be much shorter , spending only two hours .
If you plan to enjoy your trip along fresh greeny landscape in Java island , you can travel by train .
It needs almost 15 hours , but you could have the view of villages during the trip .
Basically , I like to travel by train for enjoying the view along the railway track .
Also , you can interact longer with other passengers especially native Indonesian , just in case you need to explore more about Indonesia as you would like to get temporary job here .
Indonesian people are famous with their friendliness , so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia ; they will answer your questions with pleasure .
Here are few tips for starting conversation with Indonesian : Indonesian person will reply a smile with a smile , so you can start with it ; not all Indonesian speaks English , but most students could speak English .
I suggest you to choose college students , because they are more familiar with English , besides they will welcome you with pleasure to experience their English ability ; when you are going to use public transportation , you could ask an information you need to the official employee in the station or to student for the same reason , not many Indonesian speak English .
Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people , many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia .
The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than other islands mentioned above but other islands are more challenging and natural .
If you like hiking , you could explore mountains in Java : Semeru , Ranu Kumbolo , Bromo , etc .
Joining community of hiking student can be useful , because they will be pleasant free guide for you , this trick has more effective budget for your trip .
Another way , you could follow agency to get a guide , but it is not free , you have to manage cost for the service .
It can be little bit difficult to find temporal job here , unless you got any connections with agency or local people .
Teaching English is common job for foreign people , moreover foreigner teacher is more likely than local teacher .
May my advice can be useful for your trip in Indonesia .
It is true that the scale of current marriages is larger and more luxurious than that in the past .
Thanks to increasing living standard , people are able to afford a bigger and expensive wedding .
If in the past , they just hold weddings at home to save money , now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead .
Secondly , it is likely that nowadays people focus more on appearance , so luxurious and elegant wedding is an occasion for them to show off .
It let people to know that they are important or powerful .
Therefore , the number guests invited to the wedding are much more than that those in previous time .
Obviously , expensive and larger marriage have some benefits .
It is a special case to bring people together .
Those who losing contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again .
Furthermore , modern weddings bring to people new experiences about food , lifestyle and culture exchanging .
However , there are also some drawbacks it bring about .
These such big and expensive marriages waste a lot of money and time to prepare .
Grooms , brides and their parents usually have to book restaurant , hotel , invite singer and famous master of ceremony to make the wedding serious .
Instead of that , this amount of money can help the couple buy house or car for a new life .
Last but not least , in some cases , only for the sake of showing off , many couples , after getting married , have to work hard to earn money to pay the debt for wedding expenditure .
To conclude , marriage is a landmark of individual .
However , a wedding with a reasonable scale will either satisfy the guests or reduce the burden for the couple and their families .
At first , when the ski lift rose up to the station , I was terrified as I was suspended from the ground .
Some days before we had decided to organize an excursion to a nature trail nearby as soon as we arrived at the railway stop , we were so fascinated by what surrounded us that we had been walking for three hours along a path , Suddenly , our surroundings appeared to be far wilder than it had been before so we stopped trekking and we had a look at our map .
Only then did we realize we had lost our way , we had not been paying attention to our path , the only thing we could do was to go back .
We turned towards the bushes immediately , we were worried as we had listened to the radio that a bear could have lived there .
Fortunately , it was a beautiful deer as Bamby which looked at us and ran away more frightened than us .
Eventually , it was a special trip !
Dear to whom it may concern ,
I am interested in the job because this would be an opportunity of spending my summer in a more fun way .
Another thing is that : I would improve my skills in working with children and I find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications .
I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons : I am familiarized with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one .
Another reason is that I have gained experience taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a great sense of leadership as well as the social skills needed from being a scout for five years .
All in all I can assure you that I would be a great addition to your team of workers for all the reasons above stated .
For that , I hope my letter is taken into consideration .
Last summer I spent in Oxford , UK studying English in language school for ESL learners .
I came to school with almost zero knowledge of English , and after entry tests , I was applied to level higher than mine .
When I went to class there was a group of students who had already studied together for some time .
There was not a chance to befriend with them , I thought .
Third school day gone , one of the classmates caught me in a hall and asked if I want to join them tonight for dinner .
I was needed practice in speaking so much , so it was what the doctor ordered !
There was the only problem : I can not communicate well in English and I was really shy about it .
But when the dinner started there was nothing to worry , because my classmates appeared supportive and patient .
This evening was so delightful !
The guy who invited me , Francois from France , spoke with me more than others .
Starting to spend every evening together , we spoke about past , expressed our thoughts and future plans .
Every time when I felt weak about my English he supported me like no one else .
After two weeks he returned to France , but we keep in touch even today .
Did you remember that I went to the Muse concert in Dublin last month ?
I was n't a simple spectator .
I was in charge of the tickets sale .
I could see the show from my place but the most exciting thing happened at the end of the show .
Nowadays it 's common to think that travelling by car is much more conventient than travelling by public transport but it 's no true at all .
Some surveys have demonstrated that travelling by car is more expensive that travelling by public transport .
The increase in the fuel cost for example , will have surely a negative impact on the use of private vehicles .
Moreover other costs will act upon the prices of travelling by private vehicles .
In the same surveys , the researcher show how travelling by public transport is safer than travelling by car .
The annual average of crashes caused by public transport measures of 43% , instead of the private one that is around 76% .
As for the pullotion , it could be reduced if people use the public vehicles ; it is well - known that the CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by public means of transportation are 80% less than a car .
Obviously the quality of public transport has to be improved .
Significant changes have to be done either to ensure the quality of service and the conditions of the coaches , trains and other public means of transportation .
In this way the customer can feel comfortable as they fell in theirown cars .
The latest research carried out by The Health Department in Spain show that young people are not as healthy as twenty years ago .
That could be a higher problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could raise 60 % in the next 10 years .
The reasons for that may lay in the current financial crisis that is strongly affecting over most middle classes in the country .
The low quality in products that young people eat and the little variety in eating habits could get things even worse .
Besides , too much use of computer and mobile phones is not helping to mend the problem at all .
Finally , it is proved that youths are devoting less time to do exercise than they should and as a consequence , they are not improving their general health enough .
As far as I am concerned , I think Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertisement campaigns in order to improve health in young population .
Travelling by car is only convenient in a restricted sense while public transport is overall more convenient .
What is meant by a restricted sense is that for adults , who are healthy and able bodied , having access to personal transportation is arguably quite attractive .
However note my emphasis on adult , healthy and able - bodied , for young people , for older people , for people with disabilities being able to drive brings more costs than benefits .
Furthermore the monetary costs in the long run are much better using public transport both for individuals and for the wider society .
Famous people often are annoyed , because every their action will appear in the magazines or Internet .
They ca n't do trivial things such as shopping or going to the cinema with their family insensible for the fans and papparazi .
Even when celebrities are having holidays people ask them to give an autograph .
Sometimes famous people look a little bit different that on the stage and their faces wihout any makeup appear in the Internet .
Hello James!I had already read your email and I 'm going to try to give you some advice . I know you love doing sports , in special golf , and it helps you a lot to be in shape , but , do you really have to do it ?
Is necessary for your health but , what about if you go running in the mornings ?
You keep doing sport but in another time .
On the other hand , I know that music is your passion , and in my opinion , you should n't give up music classes , when you 're stress it helps you to relaxes you .
Also you 're about to finish your classes , so if you give up music , you will discard all your effort .
Anyways , if you feel that going to your music classes is stressful and you do n't have time to do it , try a new sport ! maybe soccer , or go running in the mornings as I said before , believe me golf is kinda funny but you do n't exercise too much as you could .
I hope this letter help you to decide whatyou will do .
The complexity of human behaviour is critical in Sport .
As a result of this many studies have shown that athletes shuold be motivate to push themselves above the record .
You need a motivation to believe in your self that you can achieve it .
This attitude is especially true to Sportsman and women .
One of the most difficult sport on the Earth will learn you what it means hard work , sacrifice , pain , strain but also satisfaction , determination , pride and struggle .
The complexities in swimming are not only for the body work out but above all for the mind .
If you want to swim evryday pushing yourself above your limits , you definitely need a strong psyche and a solid motivation .
People that would to start this sport , they should know that this is not just a sport .
You certainly will learn to fail and win but the most important thing that you will lern is never give up .
Futhermore like Michael Phelps said : " There will be obstacles , there will be doubters , there will be mistakes but with hard work ... there are no limits " .
People have had a need in communication since the dawn of time .
Every human being has a need in socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends .
Personally I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It usually starts with small talks or compliments , as at school I was taught that expressing appritiation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationships .
A true friendship itself forms on a base of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time .
Friends do not have to share the same opinion on every topic , however , they should respect and support each other even if they disagree .
Mr Smith was found on the floor with next to him a glass , which was completely broken .
I thought that he must have called the reception for some wine , as the waitress said that every night after he had eaten , he always drank a glass of wine .
All night the body had lain like this on the floor .
The next day the waitress knocked once , twice , three times but no one answered , so she thought that the man might have gone out .
In fact I discovered that Mr Smith 's nephew wanted all his fortune .
Sometimes people will do anything for some money
Nowadays it 's believed that it 's better to work on your own than to work as a group .
First I completely agree with this but then when I started to think about it I realized that it 's not like that .
Firstly I think that if you work as a team you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation you could have a better and more completely answer because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
Secondly I think that the members of the team give you support , love and company .
Sometimes the members of a group began to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family .
Moreover if it is a really nice group it is funnier to work with them than to work alone .
In conclusion , I believe that it 's better to work as a team than to work on your own because they give you love , company and you could pass a very good time
It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years .
However , this election could not be the wisest as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications .
I am referring to the Internet . Born in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect the missile facilities and the central headquarters , it soon spread to universities and educational centers .
This fact , along with the spreading of personal computers , quickly became in a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century .
For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In its first years television was also an important channel to culture ( theater plays , classic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in the last years television has lost this educational focus .
The Internet , on the other side , has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet does n't play a major role .
The Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows , especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV .
This experience is unbelievable and unforgettable to me .
It was in winter 2002 when 2 friends and me were working in a hotel in a village called Tignes .
At about 8 p.m in the evening on December 12th , my friends and me went back home .
It was the end of a hard work 's day so we went to bed early ; we were very tired and we had forgotten to put out a candle .
One hour later our table was on fire .
Monica and me called out her name and we slapped her face .
At the moment , some friends and other workers who lived on the same floor go into the bedroom .
At the beginning , we could n't stop the fire , and although this night sound impossible , we managed to put out the fire .
Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always space for further discussion .
Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages .
Well , I think it has future .
First , there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams .
In smaller towns without underground there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area , so , all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you 'll reach the destination .
It 's not a secret that gas , insurance and reparings are costly .
Safity issue is very important also .
It is obvious that is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with an only person inside .
You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive ) pose a greater danger to road users than than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic .
The answer is evident , I think .
And the last but not the least thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able or just do n't want to drive , so the only way out for them is public transport .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment , lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity .
So , my opinion is that public transport does have the future . Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well .
Michael taught that he could use his father 's car , and borrow some money from his mother .
He knew that Peter was a little bit irisponcibile , but he taught that the arragement sounded perfect and nothing could go wrong .
He was thinking that this time it would be different , everything was planned and they will have a great time .
She 's gotten used to receiving those short messages every day .
No name of the author on it , but let 's face it - there was only one guy on Brooklyn who would wake up every day before the dawn , no matter if it was raining or snowing , and run like crazy to Alison 's family small flat .
Occasionally her older sister would watch her down from the hall and poke her index finger on her forehead . " What a jerk " she 'd mutter under her breath .
Thomas was one of those guys that every gal had wished to be around with .
He was handsome as hell , well - build and a true gentleman .
He worked hard at the docks to make a good living with his mother .
She lost her job when war started , as well as her husband - Tom 's father .
Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless his young age of seventeen , he would quit school and start earning money .
Try to fit a heart and bravery of a lion into a small frame of sixteen - year - old girl .
Her major health problem was asthma , as well as anemia , low immune system and underweight .
Credits to the last one , she 's skin and bones with almost no muscles .
All her clothes are from kids section and yet they 're usually too loose .
But there 's something in her big bright eyes , circled with long brown eyelashes and frecles , that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom 's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing stare .
Alison 's sister , on the other hand , is a total opposite .
No freckles as her skin is perfect at every inch .
The only thing they have in common are eyes , taken from their mother .
Rest is anything but completely different .
That 's why Mary is constantly surrounded with a bunch of fellas meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back .
This flick stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details .
The film , instead , was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn't even been filmed in Verona .
The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task , and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly .
However the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are actually in use .
Also the court is cheap and the changing room is nice and clean .
On the other hand the opening hours are not enough and they should be extended .
Is advisable to paint the walls with a brighter colour .
Apart from the above mentioned points , there maybe so many other ideas which can make a big difference to the club .
Back then when she had been a little kid , she had dreamed of seeing the entire world .
The woman had smiled to Alice and had given her some words of advice , " Young girl you lose something important to you .
Alice had looked on confusion as the woman had been walking away .
Alice had gone through the entire world , from the hottest desert to the highest mountain .
However , when she had arrived there had n't been anything but a barren desert .
She had been shocked .
Sadness stroked her heart .
It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed , but Alice 's willingness had been stronger than her fears .
Finally , after much time travels , Alice had this feeling .
That girl , indeed was Alice herself in her youth .
Has you told me that I will win some literary competitions and that some people will speak well of me , I would n't have believe you .
The year was 2012 and I had n't written anything until that day - I just had been translating some stories and once even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
But that day - it was on spring and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us about a literary competition .
The theme was ' I visited the Earth in2112 ' .
It sounded like a quite good challenge for me so after finishing the then lessons I quickly sat down and started writing .
And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email .
Only then I realised that there is nothing more to do , that I have to just wait .
First days I was a little bit nervous but day by day I started forgetting about any competition .
But a month ago my mobile phone started to ring .
I picked up and heard nice woman voice .
And that voice told me that I am a winner of a third place !
So happy was I !
That moment a bit changed my life because I 've started to write more and more stories .
And the more won competitions , the more proud was I of myself .
Since I was a child , I had been curious to know how stuff works .
Through the years , my interest in machines and electrical devices increased , so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance , and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down .
When I was in secondary school , and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists , I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
During my study , my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics .
Also , I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry , that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering .
Since I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America .
After searching and asking , I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities , and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways .
For those reasons , I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my study abroad .
Therefore , I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to .
First , I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program .
Second , TU - Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de .
Finally , TU - Clausthal located in fascinating nature .
I hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
A lot of different languages are spoken in all over the world , and it is not easy to choose one of them to learn it .
my view is that nowadays English is an important language that it is necessary for almost everyone , so I will choose to learn English first .
The most common reasons to study a language are the job and travelling .
Although in some places people do n't speak English , you always can find somebody who does .
Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentences in a few days .
Whereas there are a lot of options , we rarely start learning other language before we can communicate well in English .
Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all - pervasive .
Multimedia , advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age , unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them .
The result are insincere , misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter .
Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy , or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite ?
As a matter of fact Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition , which will last one day
Moreover Venice is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Italy .
The marathonetscoming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city , which offers a great deal of facilities
Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night .
Despite the private service is very expensive it is efficient .
Four and five stars hotels are located in the main area , but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available to families .
In addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres , cinemas and night - clubs .
On the contrary participants will find a wide range of restaurants , trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food .
In conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants .
I read your email yesterday but I had n't had the time to reply yet .
I helped catering the staff and during the concert I was free to walk around wherever I wanted because they gave me a security badge .
I had asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed .
I do n't think so ..
After the show I had the chance to meet the band members .
Here is a picture from the last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen !
In my family we are five people , my mom Malak , my dad Claes , my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard .
I compete in skiing and I think it 's very funny . I often go skiing in Åre , Vemdalen and in Ramundberget .
Once every year I ski with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Zermatt you can see the mountain Matterhorn ( the mountain that you see on toblerone package ) .
In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called Kålhuvudet .
That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun .
You can of course see the ocean and it is very beautiful .
My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree . I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them .
I read pretty much and my favourite book is Harry Potter .
If it was possible to go on Hogwarts I would do it .
Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is … Of course Harry Potter .
But I do also like a movie called The game plan .
It is about an American football player who does n't know that he has a daughter and one day the daughter came to his apartment .
Then it is a fun and fantastic story that I do n't want to say because then it is not going to be fun to see the movie .
I do n't see movies only I look at some series to .
For example Pretty little liars and Modern Family .
Pretty little liars is a little bit scary but I like it .
Modern family is my favourite series .
I like it because it is very comic .
My favourite song is a song called Chandelier with an artist called Sia .
It is a girl called Jasmine Thompson and she sing cover songs and I think she is a really good singer .
I do also like a song called classic with an artist called MKTO .
One band I like is One direction I think they sing really good .
When they were in Sweden I was on their concert and after that my voice were almost gone .
But there was really fun to be there but is what pretty cold , because on friends arena the roof was open .
My favourite food is sushi or a fillet of beef with potatoes and béarnaise .
I like sushi because the combination with fish , rice and soya makes it delicious .
I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with béarnaise , it is a very good combination .
My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called dahlboms in Åre because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever .
Hope you enjoyed your reading , I think this is what you maybe want to know about me !
Micheal tried to hit the door with hammer , but it was useless because that door was made of steel .
Snugly Micheal heard steps coming towards to him .
He opened his eyes again when the steps were faded away .
Michael felt himself strangely , because he was n't feeling walls around him .
He felt like he is about to die .
The moment he reached the light everything changed .
Micheal seemed to be really happy in this moment .
Suddenly Micheal opened his eyes and he realized it was just a weird dream .
It was amazing event !
Local people were invited and a talent competiton was held .
Number of people exceeded my expectations !
Generally , bands played great , but of course there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it did n't matter so much .
I 'll never forget the sounds and smiles of these happy people with their arms in the air who were standing under the stage .
On a Charity Fun Day the air was filled with the fabulous smells of Indian , Italian and many other world cuisine .
Unfortunately , not all of the food was tasty , so one of the thing I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoid the hot dogs .
Also I 'd recommend delicious homemade ice cream .
It was fantastic experience , especially for people for which it was intended .
It 's breaking my heart to hear that you 're in so terrible situation .
You 're such a cute , little girl .
Let me know what is your decision .
I discovered the English language when I was eight , and that amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course .
English was also the key for my passion for technology , the more that I understood the language , the more I understood how to use computers and the internet .
About six months later , I joined a computer class for kids in the same location that I took the English classes and since then , my love for computers and the language just grew .
That is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences , and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language , the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area , for it 's great universities and educational system .
I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and alghoritms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses .
Although I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic grounds and interpersonal communication , as all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good material for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .
In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals on the field of information technology in both academic and work market , travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
I would be happy too , if by any chance I could apply to summer jobs or internships , as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market work for both academic and work careers .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. for it 's differentiated educational system , for the work and research opportunities that I might find , to know better a culture that amazes me for its capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language that I love , to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here , and , in long - term , become a better professional or teacher , with a good and solid background on computer sciences , information technology and finally , system analysis and development .
There are many places to visit but the most beautiful is Traku castle .
It is very popular pace to visit among tourists .
The castle is very big and you will need some hours to visit it .
If you want to visit it , order a guide who will tell you the history of the castle in English .
Moreover , there are many souvenirs sellers so you could buy something .
" Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media art works , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
It was situated into a stand in Parque Del Retiro , in Madrid .
It was built by two different elements .
The first , placed in a corner of the stand , was made by a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets .
Seeing it for the first time it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .
Only after having read the explanation it was possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have the complete attention to its meaning and shape .
Despite their beauty , new form of arts are very complicated to understand , especially compared to classical arts .
An example could be the medieval art .
Seeing a Da Vinci 's portrait or a landscape painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted .
At first sight those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece helps to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looking at an installation art it is harder to have a clear emotion at the first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist .
In conclusion I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason , to communicate something .
In every historic period , artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways .
Classical art was more easy for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous , while modern arts are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion the difference between installation arts and classical arts stands in the feeling that they can suscitate in the audience .
Dear Camp Director :
I have experience in looking after children .
I am always willing to help in anything . I can be very creative when in comes to fun things .
In the other hand , they should learn something new in the summer camp .
Kitesurfing - this sport discipline is getting more and more popular not only in countries such as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , but also in other ones , just like Poland or Germany !
A feeling of being completely free , a joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board , an incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy .
If you just learn how to keep a control of your body standing on a surfboard and how to steer a kite , there 's nothing that seems hard any more .
Last month I helped at Adele 's concert at the Royal Albert Hall .
Although I was a cleaner , it was the best thing , that recently happened to me .
Before the concert I had to sweep up the whole hall .
During the concert I was responsible for supervision of sort - out in toiletes .
It was n't my dreamy job , but it really repayed .
After the concert I saw Adele and my friend took a picture of me with her !
She smiled to me !
By the way , I met there your exgirlfriend with her new boyfriend .
Of course , I told her , you 're dating Lisa now .
I hope , it wo n't be my last job at concert .
This past year was special for me , I graduated from High School and I took a gap - year .
It was a very confusing but probably the best year of my life and I will tell you why .
As I said earlier , I graduated from High School which was a huge relief .
It was aweful .
Thus came the question of what I was going to do next , but I was n't ready to make that descission back then so with agreement of my parents I decided to take a gap - year .
I was going to spend the next 6 months in the United States which actually teriffied me .
As my departure came closer , I started to question myself more and more if this was a good idea and if I would have a good time all those things .
The journey to the United States was surprisingly good , I had some friends on the plan who were going to the same destination as me and I actually did n't miss my family that much .
The 6 months I send there were the best of my life , I was so happy and enjoyed myself every day .
I also got to know myself better and I have reached a descission of what I want to do next year , I am going to study at the university .
I hope that I will enjoy that as much as I enjoyed this past year , it was truly amazing .
So if you are ever even considering the fact of taking a gap - year , do n't doubt , just do it .
I was wondering that maybe it 's just my imagination .
Eventually , I slowly opened the door and came out of my room .
I went to the kitchen and sit on the chair , nervously fiddling with my bracelet .
It suddenly broke apart , and all the beads dropped on the floor .
In that sinister silence , it seemed to be the loudest sound on the world .
All of sudden , my phone rang .
Before I made it to tell something , I heard terrible scream and my friend just hung up .
I felt cold sweat again , just like five minutes ago when I 'd seen open window .
We havent't talked for ages " .
We at Madhura Nagar , understand the need of protecting the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We limit the number of houses and the number of people living in those houses because more people would mean we have to clear vast expanses of land for housing which would mean a reduction in the number of trees and a deathblow to the natural balance .
We encourage people commuting to nearby places to walk or use a bicycle depending on the distance and those going to the same areas outside the town to join car pools .
We also have a biogas plant in our outskirts that takes care of the rubbish and sewage and the power generated is used for street - lights and meeting the power needs of the community office .
We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on it so that people can use them instead of plastic bags .
Each year , we encourage school - going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment .
We encourage people who come up with any innovative thoughts about how we could further protect the environment .
Dear MR . Smith
I would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook - post from the 18th of July .
I 've been working as a security guard in a lot of places around the world .
I was in a position of a leader for a Katie Perry concert and I worked for Angela Merkel when François Hollande arrived in Berlin .
I was a paramedic in first place but then I wanted to change something in my life and combined my hobby , which is going to the gym , and became a security .
With these experiences I can safely escort people , which are knocked out or a bit ill and ca n't stand the concert anymore , out of a concert and help them .
The only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I even do n't know why .
But I love basketball and handball - especially the first one - every time when we are playing basketball at school during Physical Education , I 'm so happy about it and I do my best . I do n't know how to explain why I love this game so much .
Maybe it 's because in basketball , you have to run a lot and you have to be really fast , and my second favourite sport is running .
Anyway - if someone asked me for advice about basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't the best player on the world . I 'm also not .
Public loves to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details .
Everyone deserves privacy , but public figures should be aware of the fact that the society wants to know about them as much as it 's possible .
Whether they like it or not , they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them in every single moment of their life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi should n't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life .
There are some borders that should n't be crossed .
Even though they are well known , they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them .
It 's really important for people to know the bound between curiosity and nosiness .
We should respect other 's right to privacy and let them live their own lives .
Nature is one of the most important theme in the Romantic Age , since it is a reality that inspired many writers , both novelist and poets .
It has been an important subject especially for writers from the ' ' first generation '' like William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as an inseparable reality from man , whereas it comforts in sorrow and teaches to love and to act in a moral way .
In the Romantic Age we can find another important subject based on the concept of nature : the sublime .
It is associated with strong emotions caused natural spectacles , like hurricanes , waterfalls or starry sky
The sublime inspired many writers likeW. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the view of infinite spaces , like desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sublime that Wordswoth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Romantic sublime : forms of nature that inspire feeling of awe , danger or weakness .
Also Coleridge had a concept of sublime , but for him it was associated with infinite spaces and the sense of perdition and suspense .
I am a 20 year old girl with an immense desire to get busy this summer .
I am very familiar with the tasks and rules that need to be respected in a summer camp , as I have been one in a previous summer camp within St John Ambulance .
It was in my duty to make sure everything was running smoothly , according to the program and I had to supervise and direct the other assistants if any problems should occur .
I am a qualified first aider and I am able to undertake any minor or major health problems that might arise .
I have been volunteering for St John Ambulance for 6 years now and I can say that it is a truly amazing and eye opening experience .
Here are some tips to help you get a positive first impression .
Instead of that you should show that you have experience or specific education in the area .
Going on a job interview can be a stressful experience for even the most job seekers but if you use these tips , the first impression of you will be positive .
I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily , consequently I do not have a large circle of friends .
Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend .
Throughout this friendship I have been given the support , the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship .
A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart .
For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants , simply because they are not the same people as they were before .
As you gradually grow up your world expands , your personality changes and so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school , getting our first job or changing the old one , travelling or moving to another city .
All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones .
To summarize , I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it .
There is also a food court on the third floor , catering to all sorts of customers , as well as a few restaruants on the first and second floors .
On the top floor there is a multi - cinema complex , offering several options of the latest movies .
There are two underground floors for parking , which can get a bit crowded at peak seasons , but which are very reasonably priced .
Another shopping option is the main streeet in the centre of Viña del Mar , which used to be more popular in the past , but which was displaced by the shopping centres .
All in all , I consider there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town , so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer .

Hi , my name is Emma I 'm 16 years old and I believe that I would be perfect for this summer job .
I 'm have 2 little brothers and I think I 'm capable of taking care of little and older kids .
I 've always liked to play with kifds and make fun activities with them .
My favorite activities would be : painting , and making up fun games .
Although I like playing with kids of all ages , I think that I will have more things to do with the kid between ages 8 - 10 , because I find myself more open with kids between those ages .
I can cook anything , really , just give me the ingredients and I 'll make you whatever you want .
As I said before , I 'm really good with little kids , I 've been a teacher once at a summer school .
It was 8:00 o'clock in the morning that Saturday in L.A. , and suddenly an urgent message appeared in the TV news and in all the radio channels .
They announced that the Big One earthquake would occur that afternoon at 7:00 PM approximately , so they alerted that people had to leave the city or go to save places in the few hours .
Peter decided to help his father with his work and the problems that were happening , while his mother was doing the luggage and preparing the car to leave .
Peter and his father were very busy solving problems of neighbours and it took them some hours .
As someone who hasn't sung classical before and has no background in Hindi Singing , I found it very confronting to sing at a concert after only four months of training .
However Narwal Ji has taught me from the basics of Indian singing , to being someone able to sing on stage in front of a large audience .
He had given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginner singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate .
The night had been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence a greatly .
Overall the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching .
You requested us to organise a visit to a place or building that mirrors one aspect of our life here .
We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations , and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour at and around the Grand Place of Brussels .
Away from busy and noisy roads , the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries ; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houess and shops in light colours and old - fashioned roofs .
We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to .
Sincerely ,
Most of the year I live in Poznań , because of my studies at the University , but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends .
It opens only in a time of summer , mainly for tourists .
Because of that , there are no regular employees , at the beginning of every summer new season stuff is hired .
It was like working in a paradise .
The main reason why I loved to work there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted .
There is only one auditorium so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there was a 15 minutes break in the middle of the show , for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks .
I watched almost every shown movie , some of them for more than once .
I mean , it was September , so I had a one whole month of vacation ahead of me to do whatever I wanted to and it was awesome because I could finally just relax , sleep , read books and spend a lot of time with my loved ones .
This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere , regular visitors and people I worked with .
Date : 27 Sep 2014

In 1975 the consumption of fish and chips was ten times higher than the consumption of the other two types of fast food .
However , the quantity of fish and chips plates eaten per year declined from 100 times per year in 1975 to just over 80 times in 1980 .
In contrast , the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975 , and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times respectively in 1995 .

The place is very near where I live , and I 've worked in a lot of Cafes before , unfortunately I had to leave them for school and college .
Sometimes I do n't have time for myself to have fun , and for what I can see from your place , it is very popular and full of fun people .
I 'm very eclectic , but also fierce where I should be .
I may not know how to cook the usual food from the cafe , but I am a fast learner . I will only need one day to get used to the food and learn how to practise at home , and then it 's up to me find a way to be good at it .
I wo n't be much problem for anyone .
Set in in the late 1950s France , Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different : whether they are gypsies , women that do n't depend on men , or people that do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a single mother and chocolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a small , close - minded French village , the mayor of which decides to boycott her .
During Lent , the protagonist gets to know other outcasts ( mainly women ) and help them .
One of the strengths of the film is its star - studded cast : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Dench as a grumpy , elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village , and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan .
It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie , with a little bit of jazz manouche , a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminiscences of Mexican folklore , as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Maya ancestors .
If I had to find a down side to Chocolat , it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines .
A must - see if , like me , you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles , but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michael Clifford was a lucky man who had everything he could ever want : he was a thirty - year - old English businessman married to a sophisticated mathematician with whom he had two sons and a pretty talented daughter ; he owned a successful corporation and had a gorgeous chalet near the sea .
He hardly ever drunk alcohol , but thought it would be impolite not to , as he had been invited by his colleague .
Later that night , while Michael was cheerful chatting with the barman , his mobile phone emitted a sound .
He rushed out of the pub , open the car and went inside , not knowing that he was to die in an accident because of his current state .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and personal transport , because they have both advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel .
On the one hand , personal cars are great because they allow people to travel whenever they want .
Sometimes it is cheaper to use public transport such as busses , trains or airplanes , depending on the distance .
Travelling across the Atlatic Ocean for example requires an airplane or a ship .
Trains are a great way of transport across intercontinental distances , especially since they have become faster .
All in all , I believe that public transport will not disappear too soon .
Time was ticking by and he knew that if he did n't do it now he would be in deep trouble , that his social life would be over .
All of them anxious to get outside and relax for a few hours Suffering from an endless punishment : knowledge .
As he got near his destination the density of students seemed to grow and it was becoming even more difficult for him to advance in that sea of moving bodies .
Fortunatley ,
Poland is classed as a country with a hard history and a lot of places remind about it .
Besides their past we can , fortunately adore their beauty .
In this small part of Cracow , you can meet with Jewish culture and the architectural style .
For those who enter it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
You walk among ancient , fallen tombs shaded by high trees of great age .
It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century .
Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts , graphics and paintings .
Finally , you can do shopping on The New Square , a round trading hall .
You can buy there almost everything : fresh fruits , vegetables , and household products .
On Sundays , the gamut of products is much more bigger .
Parents face with important decisions when raising children , not the least of which is whether or not they should allow their children to keep a pet .
Some parents would grasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet with him , whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet .
In my view , I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets , especially in terms of their personality development .
Take my cat , Luka , for example , I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me when I was 12 years old .
My mother told me that you would have to take care of it by yourself when I went to ask her if I could keep the cat .
Since that day , I started to take care of on my own .
I took it to the hospital when it was sick , and bought it food when it needed to be fed .
This does not suggest that children can not learn from having a pet with them .
For instance , when Luka died when I was 20 years old , I was so sad and heart - broken as if one member was lost in our family .
After that day , I started to be able to sympathize with people who have lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation .
Given upon my personal experiences , by taking care pets , children not only can learn to take responsibility , but also can learn to sympathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personality development .
Not only financial development but also the environment is essential to a healthy city .
Reducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of utmost importance in this regard .
Recycling bins have been installed in every public housing estate and most housing estates , along with the road - side ones found in every district .
We have seen a great drop in the number of solid waste .
Tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tour is also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and , above all , to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature .
With concerted efforts , we have made a great stride in environmental protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of waste and increasing number of greenery .
The round table ' Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations at the modern stage ' in St Petersburg State University
On April 29 , 2014 St. Petersburg state University hosted the round table " Russia - Turkey : prospects of relations at the modern stage " .
Bekir Günay , the Director of the Eurasian Institute , Associate Professor , told about a new understanding of Eurasianism .
He also broached a subject of the Eurasian Community development , noting that it 's very important if it 's developing to the equality or dominance .
In particular , he applied the theory of Joseph Nye Jr. 's " soft power " to the relations of Russia and Turkey .
Other participants of the Turkish - Russian round table also talked on current issues of the history and current relations between the two Eurasian countries .
He also referred to the recent action of the Turkish authorities on sudden introduction of new requirements to the expiration of foreign passports .
Just before the beginning of mass tourism season in Turkey , it was announced that the passport should be valid at least four months from the date of entry .
The round table in St. Petersburg State University has attracted quite a large audience .
During the break the participants enjoyed traditional Turkish sweets .
Living in a big city I can cycle to work every day , which I believe is a great way to exercise and reduce my environmental footprint .
Besides , cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and fowls ' chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .
However I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources ; we are , obviously , very careful with turning off the taps as we wash our hands , brush our teeth and so on , and we recycle as much as possible .
We live in the mass consumption century , when it requires more and more time of our daily routines .
For some this activity is a torture , for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
But have you ever gone to the shop just for milk and bread and came back with a full bag of goods but no bread ?
It depends on a person how often he goes to grocery , probably according to individual needs .
Most of consumers do not count time spent in food stores , as they have their own habits and their attitudes towards shopping .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater variety of goods , but require more time , while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly .
If you have a already made shopping list , it saves your time and energy , so that you do not need to wander between rows in grocery store .
When it comes to parties it is even more time consuming and irksome , than the ordinary one .
The queue you are standing in seems to be always the longest .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces are full , again facing longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds , it is the reality of nowadays .
People become crazy , nervous or dull while shopping .
Afterwards some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it causes more tension and disimproves mood !
Also , some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential , they are attracted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything , as they are excited by the shopping process itself , it causes regrets and financial problems afterwards .
Finally , it may be very fatigue , as you may waste the precious time just by walking around but not finding the thing are interested in and need .
Then you feel tired and depressed about the idea of keep looking for it in another place .
On the other hand , the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions , without any rush , they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes , best quality garmets , stylish items .
Although , shopping may be entertaining , it is still a time consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare products especially for women may be a perfect way of spending even all day .
On the other hand , searching for your favourite brands , non - seasonal products , some special goods , just looking through shelves , trying the garmets on you , asking for consultations , testing products , there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it , after entering a colourful and attractive store .
All in all , I strongly believe that shopping is not enjoyable by the vast majority .
Fortunately , this unnavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore , as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save time , money and energy for those who are not that willing to hit the mall .
She always wanted to be in the spotlights , in which she had always succeeded , since everyone adored her .
She was expecting a letter of the local drama club , in which they would reveal the character list of their new play .
Jennifer had auditioned , and she was 100% sure that she would become the main woman .
Oh my God , oh my God , that must be the letter of the drama club ! " , Jennifer screamed .
" Dear Jennifer and Carly Brown , We are delighted to inform you that Carly is chosen to become the main woman of our new play .
I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carly Brown , the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in town , was chosen to become the main woman in a big play !
From that moment on , I haven't been in Jennifer 's shadow anymore - she was in my shadow .
The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place .
English economy changed from an agriculture one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygienic conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .
These strong changes influenced very much the poetry and we can see that for example in Blake , because in " The Tyger " he uses a lot of colors referred to the industrial life ( red , orange , silver .. ) and he describes the Tyger 's creator as an artisan that create it on a furnace .
Instead the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the idea of freedom , fraternity and equality , so also these concepts influenced strongly the poetry of the period .
We can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to the West Wind " , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; instead , in the " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners in the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all the God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present also in " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud " by Wordsworth because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During recent thirteen years , the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries .
This change makes most people have to work every day even using their private time , so they need to find out the best way to save their time and fill their energy after work .
Fast food is one of ways to solve that problem .
People who have just done their work are very hungry ; they can not go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs , so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger .
To make it clear , the bosses , who are always busy in their business , usually eat fast food , they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them they even might get fast food by phone because of fast delivery .
In addition , Junk food is very easy to be found out .
Therefore , finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal with fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time .
Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon .
Furthermore , most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
Finally is the loss of traditional meals .
As the consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger for white - collar - worker , but it can also harm their health .
The customer should be careful before they choose fast food to be a part of their daily diet .
Within 6 years , Facebook has reached more than 1 billion users and still growing rapidly .
As a shy person , I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interacion .
For example , if you want to find someone who likes the same movie genders or series on social media , all you have to do is type in an interest .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers , such as depression , suicidal thoughts or even worse .
To conclude , although social media seems flawless , we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up .
I saw the advertisement for a job to work this summer camp .
I really thought I would be the right person for this .
I am really hardworking and love kids , I used to babysit for my neighbour 's kids , so looking after kids will be easy for me .
Working in the kitchen does not seem so bad either , because I know that everything depends on our attitude and if I have a positive attitude I 'll have a good time no matter if I 'm doing a fun activity or cleaning dishes .
I hope you think I 'm the right person for this , I think this would be a great experience for me as well as for the kids .
People and Change "
I feel that this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing nature of modern societies .
We are , therefore , in a situation in many countries today where to be highly mobile is something
Even though the boat was ready to go Jessica was afraid for it to break in pieces again , she almost could foresee that forthcoming heavy rain destroying her boat , so she had an idea .
She tied the boat with long and very strong textiles made out of synthetic fibers that she found on the plane ; she also used nails to join some new and more resistant wood into the boat .
She was ready to leave but something inside her was telling her to stay , the boat was very resistant but not enough to travel for days and maybe weeks across the ocean , she was afraid .
Meanwhile Jacob is completely in love with that girl he met weeks before , her name was Scarlett , she said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high - tech portable device that will change gravity in low levels and in a short period of time , like a fraction of a second , but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive , but as her dad continued with the experiment his boss got so mad he kicked them from the city into that mysterious island .
She also explained that they did n't know how the majority of people on the island got there , thereby not all of them spoke the same language , but they learned how to communicate with signs .
They had a lot of things in common , they liked the same kind of music , the same kind of food and they both liked to read about fantasies and comics .
Jacob told her again if she wanted to go with him to a better place but she still denied , until she accepted with only one condition , if all her family could go with them .
Jacob told Jessica if they could leave the island with Scarlett 's family , she was not happy about it but she said yes .
But they needed to make the boat even more resistant and rigid so it will support all the family and all the extra food they will need .
Some Pro - choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice , this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not .
Even though in some circumstances , such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies , it could be the best thing to do .
Hence , every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice .
Abortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mother is important in a child 's life especially in the first few months .
During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops .
The baby 's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation , is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother 's empathetic response .
This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child 's development could be in this case negatively influenced .
Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result .
The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult - life .
Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse .
Impregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims , all areas of a victim 's life is affected .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even though , not all victims will choose to have an abortion it has to be given as an option .
Even if , abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solutions for accidental pregnancies .
It is for the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception .
Otherwise , you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option .
Abortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies or if the mother has been sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist child .
I had the opportunity to be a student and work as a research assistant with Dr. Montés in the same field .
He taught to people from different backgrounds , to undergraduate and postgraduate students , and managed to explain difficult public health topics marvellously .
Also in Master 's degree final project II , Dr Montés helped us to accomplish the master 's degree thesis with excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Montés , I experienced great learning in many fields , not only in Public Health topics but also in research methodology , public speaking , and writing .
I witnessed and learn form his ability to work with other faculties such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Economics , and School Law .
I assisted to policy making forums and events where Dr Montés was a speaker and his opinion was highly respected .
Moreover , we developed projects with multidisciplinary teams for the following institutions : the Colombian Ministry of Health , and the World Bank with excellent results .
I reckon Dr Montés fulfils the requirements of the position you offer .
Since he has great expertise teaching , and an excellent boss , respectful of the opinion , time , and personal background of everybody .
I think that he will be great asset for your college .
I 'm writing in response of the letter the professor Collins wrote to you .
In the letter he complaints about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to success in a future work , but I do n't agree with this statement .
I think that the real problem that makes our schools so out - of - date comparing to that of other countries is the way teachers get in touch with students and transmit them their knowledge .
As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain .
They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience , as something their future is based on .
Secondly , in his letter the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment .
I agree with this recommendation because I think it 's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year , offering always new materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
Many people feel that it is good to do their student life easier .
On the one hand , I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information on textbooks because they have existed for many centuries .
For this reason , I believe that they have content more reliable .
Furthermore , if you go to a library , you could spend all day seeing books and learning about different things so in these places there are many ancient books .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoying more working with textbooks because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Also , in my opinion , young people should not use computers for much time because this could be dangerous for their health , appearing sight problems or headaches .
Taking everything into account , in my opinion every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education .
There is a lot of people I admire , starting with my own parents as they have to work so hard to end lines and to pay the rent as well as their employees and to give us- my brother and me- a good living today and future tomorrow .
As a writer - to - be I admire her work creating a fantastic world of magic and epic as well as dark characters which are recognizable all around the globe .
His ' Song of fire and ice ' saga has been brought into the television world in the name of Game of thrones and it is currently being awarded as the best drama tv series of all times .
My fascination about those people is that they fought for their people 's rights , black race 's rights , in a world of white people treating them as slaves and bullying them .
Because knowledge is the best weapon we got against those who want to rule us as they want .
I am at home in my lovely house , where I love every detail of the interier , where every thing is on its place .
It is weekend and we all together today .
We play piano , sing favorite songs , play table games , we laugh a lot and love these weekends together very much .
Sometimes our kids invite friends and today my son came with his girlfriend .
After all this courses that I 've done I am wise and do n't talk a lot .
Next to me everybody feel calm and confident . I 've learned a lot in the last 15 years .
Every word I say I say for a reason .
My kids are proud to have parants like me and my husband .
Together we make this world a better planet .
We found a way to help a lot of people to live happy life and enjoy what they have .
We 've planed a nice event to celebrate my 50 .
Friends , colleagues , family all thes people who was next to me on this way to this wonderful day .
I have just started teaching a new , face to face group of adults .
I was excited to get back into the classroom , I mainly teach online today , and try out some of my new skills on a group .
The group 's native language is Amharit ; they have all had to learn Hebrew , so English is a third or for some of them a fourth language .
So I switched off the projector , took out my white board pen , dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching .
To begin with , recent statistics reveal that obese adolescents ' ratio is rising .
And last but not least , it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop their social and intellectual skills .
In addition , spending too much time in activities like watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports .
And finally , teenagers may become more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers .
For instance , filling the fridges with a great amount of fresh fruit and vegetables , doing some exercise and have some fun with friends regularly .
How are you ? I 'm taking a year off and staying in London for six months so I hope you can help me if it is n't too much to ask .
I 'd like to find a part - time job but first of all I have to find an apartment to live , so I was wondering if you can look for a small apartment where I can live in ; it would be better if it 's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time .
I 'm looking for a well - paid job because I know that houses are expensive in the city centre .
I 'm looking forward to being there , I also need to take a rest and that 's the reason why I want to find a part - time and not a full - time job .
I hope I 'm not asking too much and I 'd be really pleased if you 'll give me your help .
Thanks you very much .
The more computer science influences human 's lives , the more important status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade year ago , robotics was just limited to scientific research .
However , today it is used in more fields , such as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as well as education .
In the first place , robotics activity could provide learners with real situations which are related to irrelative courses , especially in scientific and medical ones .
2012 ) described an experiment from Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% students correctly gave the diagnoses .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training , whilst 63% of them thought it had a great value in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in this experiment , students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also realize weakness of students specifically .
University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment , which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic building block system ) could do on language tests .
Surprisingly , the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are smart to react to surroundings , and build binary expression to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to do tasks .
Two groups of participants were asked to do suture - tying task and a secondary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - task .
It was found that there was an apparent difference on average speed and completion time when comparing tasks from students with basic knowledge and the one from another group .
Moreover , in the task with distraction , experienced group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster in analyzing .
Even though it becomes more efficient to study with robotics ' help , uneasy operating requires much time .
Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out of this shortage .
Today , more people not only in the field of education , but also in different fields , have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploring and studying .
It is possible that the robotics would be a normal part of individual 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) made some examples of robotics in daily lives : social human - robot , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitment robot , care robot , robot - therapy .
To a country , robotics could be new weapons for the future technological wars .
However , there is some debate that it is against ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
However , disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to human 's lives .
In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .
Besides influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design to future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve application of robotics .
Public transport allows you to save time and money in commuting .
Public transport is so necessary in big cities that car industry is continuously developing new means of transport .
Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute , but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes .
In small cities it is easiest to travel by car .
Some places have scenic beauty in abundance while many are famous for their architectural wonders .
In addition every person has different tastes , choices and preferences .
Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interests .
I have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries like Belgium , Great Britain , Spain and others .
But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of Red Square .
Nowhere expresses Moscow , Russia 's vast and ancient capital like Red Square .
An enormous 400 by 150 metres , Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin , GUM ( Department Store ) , State Historical Museum and Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos ( aka St. Basil 's Cathedral ) centres of government , commerce , history and religion .
It includes domes , cupolas , arches , towers , and spires is sure to inspire you every bit as much in real life as in the photos .
All these and many more like its cultural places , famous streets connected to square and gorges as well as old buildings make it " spirit of Moscow " .
Indeed , the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and have unique spirit .
Anyway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixes comedy and pathos , while the Brontë sisters ' realism is plenty of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors , where they grew up .
In addition , Dickens , as long as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels , uses quite frequently the first - person narration .
For example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's most autobiographical novel , the story is talked with a first - person narration with the point of view of the protagonist as an adult .
Much shorter than their fellow colleagues , they have always been able to compensate for their physical lacks with an extremely good tecnique accompanied by a strong head .
You are alone on the tennis court to face your contender .
Though you might be fighting for long and getting tired and tired , you have to search for the strength inside yourself to continue and reach the end of the tennis match .
You have never to surrender : until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground , you have to keep fighting , regardeless of the score .
Fate may play a role but you have still to try and bring out the best of yourself .
Nonetheess , it helps to shape your own personality .
I would definitely recommend whoever would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit .
Although it might look difficult at the beginning , time after time you will come to realise how tennis will positively impact on your personal well - being .
I 'm glad I finally heard from you after all this time .
Anyway great to hear that you got the job you really wanted and that you enjoy it quite a lot .
However cool to hear that you 're coming to Enschede in a month 's time !
I 'm available whenever you are so it 's an affable idea to meet up and hang out .
We could go shopping in the city centre , they have some very cool stores that we both will be able to enjoy even a Primark and I haven't seen some shops anywhere else yet .
Furthermore there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together , since they 've got some very exciting films coming out .
Or else there are some pubs we could visit , most of the time I quite enjoy going to a pub on the weekends myself , but it 's all up to you .
I 've had lots of things on my head recently , especially after my mom died .
It was very considerate of you to send condolences so please , have my thanks .
I 'm still looking for the one suitable for me .
Last summer I thought I found it .
Also the staff there was very nice and they wanted me to stay , but I needed more money so unfortunately I could n't .
Tell me more about the people you work with and how do you feel there ?
It was a cold night of November I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael , we have been looking for that temple since our teen years the temple of the silent cartographer .
The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden into the temple protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer , he is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
at the entrance of the temple were two statues the first was white and the second red , the statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer , once we passed the sculptures our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
Then we heard a big noise coming from inside the temple it was Soneka his appearance was glorious a big warrior using a golden armor and a big sword his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the sound our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer Michael decide to stay out the vault I run into the cartographer and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
Some of the aspects have been discussed during my meeting with Mordechai in August .
I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever imagine .
And because history has a way of repeating itself I truly believe that the olden days of using public transport are making a come back .
On the one hand owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want without being tied down to a set timetable and furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
On the other hand , today we are forced to share a transport with other people due to economic problems that our country is facing .
People do not earn as much money as they used to , in fact they earn a lot less .
Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
How are you doing ? I 've heard in the grapevine that you 're making a killing with your last pc program .
On the contrary , I 'm just getting used to look up every day on my computer .
One good news is that finally I gave up and bought my first Smartphone .
It has turn out to be very handy .
I also like to have a look at the foreign newspapers but they only let you to read the headlines and the beginning of the article .
I always thought that the Internet was amazing , but now I even surf the web to find some solutions for my children 's homework .
It 's like a blog but it 's written by many people who write there their impressions about beautiful sights .
Well , that 's all for now I hope to hear about you soon .
The structure is divided in these sections :
- Method : Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzed and the reasons why we 've chose them
Furthermore , we will give some examples of clauses that represent better the meaning of our songs .
- Conclusions : The questions we made before will be answered .
With our analysis done , this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning
These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look we will find some sexism in some parts .
However , there 's a hope for women to find a song that does n't treat them like an inferior gender .
Still , women are the victim in three different ways . We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret , made by some specific situations .
Anastasia 's song tells a story of a victim , meanwhile the others talk about women that fell guilty because they have hurted men .
We have found this kind of agent in the songs with the love relationship as the subject .
In our research , the cognition verbs have been the most common inside of the group of the mental ones followed by the affection ones , which is quite normal when describing a love relationship
The woman uses mental and material processes the same amount of times .
Regarding mental processes , cognition is the type more used .
The material processes show some actions that the girl would like to erase because them only make emotional abuse to the man .
As we can see , the boy gave her love and she just want to leave him .
If we look to the boy processes , we will find only positive things .
The processes that appears more usually are mental and relational ( attributive type ) .
These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man
.
On the other hand , the woman just say " I 'm sorry " .
The mental processes , specifically the cognition ones , tells us that she had thought a lot about what she did and that she is wrong .
The other participants appears a few times , but these participants tell us important things about the relationship .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to understand better the situation , but actually they just confirm what the girl feels .
She is regreting because their relationship get worse and it was n't what she supposed it could be .
She broke up , but now she is on his hands .
This can only be explained because he is a good boy and she was ( probably ) confused .
Although now she is sure , she had suffered a lot . " The cold " and " the fear " was inside her .
Even though , there 's a sentence that can confuse anyone .
She has to do it , and is a sacrifice .
This means he still loves her , but at the same time he 's still hurt .
Finally , the woman tells him that she would understand that he does n't want to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
The problem is that maybe is too late and she only can wish " I 'd realized what I had when you were mine " .
This sentence and some others sound like if they were pronounced by a man …
After the first few words , you will like the experience and will be hard for you to stop .
It is always interesting to communicate with natives of a foreign language comfortably .
You may find the first initial stages of real stress .
To speed up the learning process , you need to read many comic books in the language that want to learn . I will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you .
You also need to choose books of your favorite authors .
This is important because you understand their way of writing and will be easy to understand . Enrolling in different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great aid to you .
Anyway , I was thinking maybe you can help me out with this latest one . I 'm supposed to do some research on eating customs around the world and I figured , instead of just doing a quick search on Google and grabbing something off a Wikipedia article , I 'd ask you for a more direct source of input on the habits of the English .
If I quote you on my work , I might score a few extra marks .
Proposal for the development of a sports activity .
Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practice this kind of activities .
In my opinión running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to start moving and getting fit , in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time .
This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and with a non - significant investment would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
To start running this community will need a few things .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space where to practice it comfortably .
With this in mind money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacules in their way .
There are almost no contraindications to practise this sport so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .
This activity not only improves your body and health but also helps you have positive thoughts making everyone feel happier .
Conclusión
In my opinion improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives .
The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading , while the speaker offers three reasons to refutes the reading passage .
The first point , suggested by the lecturer , is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading .
Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young can toads from moving through the water way , the fence is useless .
Thus , the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could avoid the spreading .
The lecturer 's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered .
In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
Finally , it is argued in the listening passage that disease - causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster .
The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
To conclude , the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
National fence , volunteers , and virus are not good solutions to the cane toads spreading problem .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again with stunning five outing !
It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the " Mission : Impossible " series , much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties , and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25 years old " Days of Thunder " .
Finally , a special mention goes for Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling score , just a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
But it is also because of these set of beliefs , mostly of religious origins , that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever - changing needs of all of their people .
One of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability .
In most Latin American countries , millenary practices such as silversmithing , not only keep the region in touch with its heritage , but they have become the sole source of income for many communities .
Progress and traditions are not opposites in a socie ty were respect and tolerance for others is the priority .
People who break the law , should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally .
Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail .
This is unfair , because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society .
It is better that they do a certain amount of community work , for example clean their graffiti , which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti , and thus , prevent them from making new ones .
Working in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence .
Everybody deserves freedom , despite its crimes .
Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated , I believe that had better do some community work .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
This will help them realize their mistakes and thus , quit doing them .
The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house , which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place in .
As the movie develops , it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer form his / her own conclusions .
Although it had bad critics , the movie was well received by the audience ; not to mention Jennifer Lawrence 's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising .
Actually I intend to study law but since there is no ' law ' in the subject choices so I chose economics .
Without law , this world that we are living in will not be in order and peace , but in chaos .
I believe that every human , organization and company has their own rights and it is in my duty to use my legal knowledge to help them from infringement of their rights .
My study plan is to untertake a pre - university programme locally to prepare myself for further studies overseas .
In my opinion , the exchange of thoughts and views between all these brilliant people is exactly where a totally new and creative idea will spark .
From a very young age children can gain basic computer skills through programmes that allow them to learn , draw , paint and play .
However , there are various negative aspects to using com - puters .
Social networking is a tool used by people all around the world .
However I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good .
All social networks have their own pros and cons but certainly there are some social networks that affect more than others .
In conclusion I can say that the social network that affects population the most is Facebook .
It affects our lives in many ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolations , friendships , and even our very own sense of humanity .
Facebook has more bad effects in adolescents than in adults , they are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online .
It is more likely that adults would , use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves , their family , find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took .
Comments that are left on their pages mean more to them than words said face to face
Adults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abuse from using social networks , specially Facebook .
Teachers at school may improve more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extremely way .
At work , bosses may reduce employee 's salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are produced by social networks .
Proposal to improve School 's facilities for language learners .
First , an inspection to the school 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premises .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondly , It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room .
Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers , the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board .
The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages .
Finally , authentic material in foreign languages was not found in the school 's library .
It is crucial to provide students with printed material in the target language .
Thus , I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school 's library .
I strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention , the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced .
How would the entire world in general and the mountaineering fraternity in particular , judge my decision ?
I could have been pulled over the snowy cliff by Joe 's fall , in my effort to pull him up instead .
Picking myself up slowly after the numbness around my waist and hip had subsided ; I knew I had little time to apportion blame to Joe or myself .
After all , we were in a team in search of personal glory to be the first to ever climb the west face of this Andes mountain !
I had to look to help ; there was little time to lose .
Ever since I started learning English I have found quite handy watching TV series , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the plot properly .
On the other hand , I have been in search of the series which catches my attention and it took me very long until I finally put my finger on it .
Although the story is focused on the Lord 's family , the service has an important part to play , as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is getting old - fashioned .
The main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed , with its own characteristics and personalities .
Even the background is cleverly chosen what enhances the intriguing and dramatic script .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie Smith , which is one of my favourite actress .
Because of all these reasons , I highly recommend taking into account Downton Abbey to be included in your top ten list .
My penultimate position was as chief executive of a company with photocomposition , which was followed by the creation of a publication service serving the " Sell Side " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sense of organization and easy adaptation to new environment .
Furthermore , I am fluent in English language , with good writing skills .
Conscientious by nature , I always strive to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consistently completing my tasks .
NB : In addition , in the case of employment , I would receive an allowance of a participation of 50% of the salary for a period of two years .
About work , since you are a native speaker of English language and you have and idea about teaching English as a second language , you can apply for teaching centers that offer jobs for native - speakers of English language .
And it will be good preparation for your study at college .
The success of the soap opera depends on the theme , the people have to weather to relate to it or have interest on it .
As a typical Brazilian I have a favorite soap opera , is called Floribella .
The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress , she has amazing friend and they have a band together .
She starts to work for Mister Frederico , a young and wealthy man who has three brothers to take care .
He is arrogant but Flor is the only one who can calm him down in difficult situations .
She falls in love with him , but unfortunately he is engaged and his fiancée is an awful person who always try to humiliate Flor .
I 'm afraid to say that this soap opera does n't have a happy end and I did n't enjoy the end either , but I still recommend it because it 's a beautiful love story and the characters are really amusing and the story is funny and lovely .
Despite its end and all others odds that it may have , I 'm still a big fan of Floribella and I ca n't wait to watch it again on Netflix .
And by the way , the soundtracks are awesome , you 'll be addicted to them .
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) is indicated in more than 90% of missions statements around the world .
As for my city , the mayor gives environment his top priority and a budgeted plan under the process of implementation .
awareness sessions have been made to explain the difference among re - use , recycle and reduce .
a different color trash bags were distributed to citizens to be used at home to separate the trash according to each material .
Also , Films on soaring birds were played to explain the importance of birds in cleaning the atmosphere .
It is worth to mention that schools are considering Environment subject is part of the education sytem that should be taught to students .
Finally , I 'm proud to say that taking care of the environment is part of my and my family daily life .
Trash distribution , using green products that repect the ozone layer , not wasting water and many other actions .
I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor of English with an emphasis in nineteenth - century American literature that you advertised in the February 20XX MLA Job Information List .
Over the past five years , I have taught a variety English courses .
I have extensive experience working with ESL students , as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and disabilities like ADD and ADHD .
I pride myself in creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thought and writing skills .
Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts , through a combination of individual conferences , class activities , and group discussion .
I argue that , rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher , female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than previously has been assumed .
Not so long ago I watched film called " 47 Ronin " .
The action takes place in Japan , in times of samurais and witches .
The main hero is a mysterious stranger , betrayed by everyone , sold into slavery , chosen by fate to administer revenge , will become one of 47 warriors that defy death .
Appearing from another world he will rise up against the darkness to protect his forbidden love .
I also liked the plot built on a base of a Japanese legend .
And I just could n't forget to mention beautiful decorations and realistic special effects .
A transportation vehicle that has changed people 's live .
Not only that , what prides itself as the most influential vehicle - as most public recognized - is the automobile .
There are people who have never ridden a bicycle , and people who have never been on an airplane but it would be hard to find a person who has never been in a car .
It is generally believed that the invention of car leads to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers , to the growth of the suburbs .
Prior to the automobile , is the horse and wagon life , it is not feasible for people to live far from their place of work .
Moreover , it leads to an important expansion in commerce , resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls , department stores , serving as a powerful pull to tourism .
What greatly increased mobility leads to significant changes , additionally , lies in various lifestyles .
Being able to live far from one 's workplace , people could travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip .
It may be for a day , a week , or a period of time .
In the urban city , the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted the growth of the tourist industry .
Though being good enough , yet the growth of population and mobility do not tell the whole story .
This powerful vehicle is counted vital for another reason : being an indispensable factor in many aspects .
It is the key that supports many industrial fields , such as steel , machinery , plastic .
The whole business success would not have met perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well .
Thanks to the speed , excitement , and convenience of the cars , our lives are enriched .
The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant is the place to be on a Friday night .
The staff 's clothes are beautifully coloured and believe it or not , all of them are Japanese and can speak English fluently .
The moment you pass the huge wooden doors , the music sets you back in Meiji Era and you feel like you are about to meet a very important samurai .
JOb and social life both play important roles to put people 's lives together .
In my opinion , my social interaction balances my life more than does my working experience .
The companionship of our loved people is always the best solution to release our pressure .
For example , every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me , and makes me breathless .
Meanwhile , I always feel exhausted and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day from the work .
However , I always can recover my energy after having a little nice chat with my family or friends .
Therefore , the happiness brought from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work .
Take my yoga class for example .
Meanwhile , they are friendly and willing to share their knowledge with me .
Both learning new knowledge and making new friends make me feel delighted .
Therefore , an active social life not only benefits my mental health but also keep me in a good mood .
Lastly , some people may think that co - workers naturally melt into our social life since we spend so much time in the workplace .
However , most of the time people keep a good relationship with their co - workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
For example , we talk about something trivial , such as gripes , and gossip , with our colleagues .
Therefore , the more deeply our emotions interact , the more tremendously our happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate support , growth in life experiences , and emotional interaction , I agree with the statement that the social life has more of an effect on my happiness than does my occupation .
In other words , even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co - workers , personally I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love .
As a result , I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than does my job .
When I opened the door imagine my surprise ... There was a large box standing in front of the door , addressed to me , while I had never received packages before !
The only post ever sent to me was an anniversary card , sent by my grandmother before she passed away .
Still a bit surprised , I grabbed the box up , which proved to be no picnic , as it felt as if it had been filled with rocks .
If only I had looked a bit better where I placed my feet ...
Children and elders ca n't have a driving license , so if they need to go somewhere , using public transport is their only option .
Travelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment .
In big cities , the air is very polluted because there are too many cars . Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment , something that most people are aware of , but still they prefer to use their own vehicle .
There are some reasons why people leave shop in a bad mood , or even do n't want to get in them .
For others it is overall a pleasant experience they can not enjoy as much as they would like .
Firstly , shopping may be uncomfortable , because more often than not we can hear there tiring music , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queue usually are very long .
Sometimes women go to the store , just to watch the new stuff , to look around and questions asked by sellers make us angry .
It is said that the man , who go shopping more than one hour is angry and tired .
Sometimes it is also a trouble for women , who want to go shopping with her partner .
To sum up , doing shopping is inevitable , so we can make everyday shopping more enjoyable .
For exapmle , we can take at least one family member with us .
Going from one store to another can waste your time , cost you a lot in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaust you ; when it comes to products that your regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price ; or just choose online shopping - is a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home , without having to go out on a rainy day , deal with noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , spend money on gas and wait in huge lines .
First of all I would like to begin with giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting belongs to .
The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey which constitutes the country 's economic , cultural , and historical heart .
The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within city limits .
Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires had been ruled from .
In order to give brief information on them I would like to touch on some of them .
Hagia Sophia was built as a cathedral in 537 , converted to a mosque after the conquest of Istanbul , now is being used as a museum .
Topkapi Palace was built in 1470 's and Ottoman Empire was ruled from this palace for 380 years .
Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century and is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that still lie beneath the city of Istanbul ; size of 143 by 65 meters , with capacity of holding 80,000 cubical meters of water .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meter located in the courtyard of Istanbul University 's main campus in Beyazıt Square .
Actually I was asked to recommend only one place , but Historical Peninsula is already an area where those historical distincts got together .
I hope the given information is useful for you .
I am writing in regard to some important documents I left in your hotel room during my stay .
Last week , I joined the C&A meeting as one of the major speakers .
The following conversation was so engaging that I forgot the time and , as a result I got late for my departure to Chicago .
I am not completely certain , but I remember that the last time I kept them was near the tiny blue table located at the left corner of the room .
If you found them , could you send them to my office by post ?
Having goals in life will make ones ' life meaningful and purposeful .
They are studying in an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
Being able to study in an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience .
As we all know , nowadays , English proficiency is on the list of the required skills to be employed and the market highly demands it .
Secondly , the experiences one gets from a multicultural medium is very valuable and makes one more matured .
there are many reasons why I want to be a programmer .
primarily , because being a developer is my dream job and secondly because developers make a lot of money .
I wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old .
For example , if I want to marry in the future , I have to be able to send my kids to a decent school and provide them with what they want . not to mention wedding party expenses .
To sum it up , graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my mine aims .
Having a good job and a high salary will make my life richer and more awarding .
With the advent of individually owned vehicles like the car , an individual 's dependence on public transport has certainly reduced .
However , with that being said , in my opinion , there is still a lot of future for public transport .
I 'd like to highlight the factors that would support my opinion in a certain order that pertains to a wider acceptance .
First of all , from a cost perspective , public transport is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost reduction concept like ' car pooling ' is not followed .
The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none , especially in common situations like long distance commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and lights .
From an environmental standpoint , use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented helping in preserving the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi where the carbon emissions are very high .
However , there 's always a channel that sends out a new episode .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find some programmes you like between all the trash because of the wide variety .
During the past five years I have been organizing several events not just in England but also in the United States and Portugal .
However I have also previously worked with older people .
As a matter of fact when you get to know me better , I am very helpful .
Today i want to talk with you about the process of making bank notes .
We use cash everyday and it is of great importance to our daily life .
Firstly , something about designing must be taken into consideration .
Not only the background colour but also the artwork we need to choose .
Apart from that , we also need to design security issues .
After that , we now need to print it out .
Every bank note should be coloured both sides and we even need to use special ink in case of been copied .
Some good quality sheets will be packaged and distributed to the market but the bad sheets would be disposaled .
Maybe there would be some partially damaged sheets so the bank notes will be separated into good and bad .
The main features of these bank notes are good quality and effort made by bank workers .
So do n't look down on the bank notes in your hand now , they are precious .
It went out of control and they started fighting .
Peter tryed to stop them but it was impossible , so he tried to find somebody to separate them .
He did n't found anyone so he grabbed Louis and tried to calm them down .
Lucas wanted to apologise and forget what happened but Louis was really hungry , so Lucasdecided to go home .
The ball went straight the police station window and broke the glass .
Peter got so scared that ran away .
Louis got caught and told the cops that Lucas was the one that had broke it .
The police went to school to talk with Lucas and try to find a fare punishment .
Peter knew that Lucas was n't guilty but he and Louis were best friends since the elementary school , he had to do his decision and he only had two minutes until they took Lucas to the police station .
Peter got up and told the cops what really happened , Louis tried to excuse himself but it was too late .
Louis had to pay the window and also clean the school 's canteen for two months , but he realized that what he did was wrong so he apologised to Lucas .
It seemed that the man in the wheelchair was looking for something but suddenly , he took a couple of books and put into a hidden pocket in his wheelchair .
Angie and the store detective ran after " the false disabled " but he was younger and obviously , he ran faster .
When it seemed impossible to catch him , a girl , who was crossing the street in a wheelchair , crashed into the thief and he fell down on the paviment .
Because of this , the store detective could catch the thief and recovered all books .
To express her gratitude , Angie called the girl as " honorary customer " of her bookshop and gave her a crime novel collection like a present .
When the American series ' House ' was firstly broadcasted on TV , it immediately hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the great actor Hugh Laurie made the result really innovative for a TV series .
He only agrees to take over cases nobody else could solve and most of the time he succeeds .
Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson , but he never really wants to so he gets addicted again .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do literary anything to save a patient 's live , although sometimes he goes too far .
The series had a great appeal on many countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series huge success .
Also , the medical cases are intriguing and although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much , the struggle to save a person 's life captures everyone 's interest .
The innovative aspect of ' House ' is that he often takes illegal action , for example breaking into a patient 's house to investigate environmental factors , which may have caused the particular disease and hardly ever is he punished for it .
I believe it well deserved such popularity , as apart from its scenario , it was on the whole qualitative .
My only objection is that it sometimes went too far which made the audience dislike Dr. House .
Nevertheless , it distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks out of the box .
The first time I knew about volleyball , I was in my last Secondary School year and we were invited to cheer up a local team during a Regional Tournament in Lima , Peru .
I was amazed with the atmosphere at the Coliseum , with its shiny wooden court , the noisy people around it , that sharp sound of the referees 's whistles ... Then I decided to take up the game .
Once I got fitter enough , I started enjoying the game , learning its strategies , developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time .
I would strongly recommend the youth to take up this sport .
They will soon be engaged in a healthy , defiant and never boring activity and also will develop strong bonds with each other , responsibility and compromise .
The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used if the benefit of the students and , indirectly , in the benefit of the local community .
Needless to say , in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire , the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector .
Sportive activities might boots the student 's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary .
A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares ' more enjoyable than solely studying them will .
Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life .
Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating .
DYI Classes
As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms , without their parents , they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves .
The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives .
These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society .
The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue .
Today 's television is the paradigm of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly popping up and only a very few controls are done on the quality of what it 's actually broadcast .
So TV , which could be an invaluable source of information and entertainment , actually is becoming a big issue to the development of our society and new generations in particular .
The potential risks for our new generations
Having an easy access to such a rich offer before having developed the ability to operate correct choices or filter the information received , our kids and juniors are constantly under attack of dangerous behaviour models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .
The absence of the parents or the fact they usually have no control nor way to drive their choices makes me very worried about the future of our society .
It 's not too late , though , to try to have our beloved TV back to the importance which radio had for our parents and grandparents , we only need to see it as a potential new social problem and start a process of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving the most virtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I believe that if public transport has no future , then our environment will not have it either .
However , the use of public transport , especially in high density cities , allows people to save time while commuting to their study or workplace , as trains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It not only helps reducing pollution , but also allows users to save money , in a world where the cost of gasoline is exponentially increasing .
I believe that people should limit the use of their cars only to special occasions , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so , we will help to preserve our atmosphere free of CO2 emissions , and all the grim consequences they have .
I read about your summer camp in the internet and I would love to work with you .
I m 16 years old , tall , extroverted , very energetic and cheerful and friendly .
I love kids , and i m very outgoing .
I think I can be very helpful to your camp , helping you taking care of the kids and also helping you in the kitchen because I really love to cook .
When I was younger i went to a camp , and it was one of the best memories I have so it would be really great to know I would make some kids make the same way .
I really hope you accept me in your camp , and I wait with excitment your response .
Today , I 'd like to share with you a small but historic story , also together with my own view on it .
I hope you would like it .
In the historical river , there was a dynasty called Jin , during which this story took place .
In his early age , he lost his mother to illness .
As a result , in order to be sure that he could get the same love from mother like other children , his father married another woman .
On the contrary , the fact was inconsistent with what he expected .
Not concerning the harsh environment but her own appetite , she commanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish .
In desperation , he stepped to the river bank .
So depressed was Lucky Wang that he simply lay on the ice with weeping .
It was exactly when he was hesitating whether went home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two craps leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him .
Surprised and delighted , the boy took the fish home and prepare delicious fish soup for his stepmother .
After listening to the small story , some people were deeply moved by the happy ending , however , others thought it was unrealistic .
No matter what the fact was , or even it never happened , the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it was a fiction , the goal to make all the people in the society be filial could also be achieved , which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time .
Also , it was the governors ' terminal purpose .
At this day and age it is falling on the taxpayers .
It does not boost their confidence in future perspectives .
We often hear than no obstacle is ever insurmountable , however , is it true ?
Sooner or later we will face the music .
Only in that moment we will understand that we are one of the millions pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent life as we deserve .
First of all , it will be a good idea to encourage young people to start saving money as soon as possible .
In such a way they can remain alert and no matter what will happen .
Secondly , the state can take 5 percent from every salary .
The pensioners will receive their money when they retire .
It will be long - lasting benefit for both parts .
Our state will have a large sum of money which is an invaluable source .
On the other hand the pensioners will be sure in their future .
Everyone should think not just about his benefit , but about others .
However , step by step we will work our way up .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree about the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You only have to be aware of when leaves your public transport and be there a couple of minutes before .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening music or reading a book .
Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it worth it , because you can save money .
I usually travel by public transport and it is the half of the cost than if I do it by car .
So , I think the statement would be like this " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complexify its field of possible actions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic value " if you will ) also plays an important role , again , intensifying the relationship between team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences , finishing a play , or just stylishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the socially bonding ability of it , while on game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no strings attached nature of streetball events always compensate its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , reveal to be shared between every single sports event ) .
It is a fun , culturally - enriching experience which I recommend anyone interested in going beyond the competitive aspect of sports to engage .
Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which produces serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
Nevertheless , governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
For instance , in Chile the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and such problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
Public transport has been improved to such an extent that nowadays it is probably competing with private transport .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car .
Without a doubt , long distance journeys are best carried out by plane .
When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is taken when no other option is possible .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car , pay its maintenance cost and fuel .
Indeed , the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly recovers the amount invested .
More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase so does for transport ; economic policy of importing countries tend to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage because it is an individual decision .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and surely public transport will play an important role .
I found out about this new shop from friends and pictures online so I decided to come check it out for myself .
As I had arrived just as they open at 1 pm , I had the whole place to myself .
The majority of the space was taken up by a U shape marble counter where customers can sit and observe their desserts being made .
The patio is probably a bit narrow to place tables outside but people can go out and enjoy the view when the weather is cooler .
I started chatting with the chef who told me that he wanted to start a dessert lounge for people to relax and enjoy desserts .
He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rush where you have to line up for an hour and finish eating in like 20 minutes before they kick you out .
There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting so I asked the chef for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate which was perfect for me !
Each dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse our palate .
The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat .
Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to taste his artful presentation as it came to life !
It literally looked like a piece of abstract art painting .
This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .
I did n't know what charcoal ice cream would taste like but it was actually chocolate mixed with a bit of charcoal .
The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy .
My surprise favorite was the microwave sponge cake that the chef added at the last minute .
He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraint and timing .
The dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as well .
My tea was brought out with teapot and a small hourglass timer where I am supposed to wait 3 minutes before I should pour the tea .
The smell was wondrous from the lavender while the flavor was almost mint - like and refreshing to drink .
They also offered me some honey to add into my tea when I thought it was n't flavorful enough at first .
Verdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth !
The price was n't cheap for dessert but if you take into the entire experience and compared to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day so stay tune !
As the days go by , more discoveries are being unearthed in a rapid pace .
Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class , Einstein in his first science class and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time .
Nonetheless , there are some disadvantages . If a person possesses the magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves from , he or she can basically rule the world .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if one side of the magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people 's powers .
It has been a long while since I last met . you and dad .
Please do not worry too much about me , I am having a joyous time here in Japan .
Undeniably , the food culture disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancestors were originated from the same ethic .
But still , our customs had evovled a lot .
Due to the geographicall conditions where Japan is located aside Pacific Ocean , people here are adapted to eat raw fish and would like to put it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially for under - cooked fish .
It makes me arouse a feeling of nausea .
So , I can only have cup noodle for those nights when I leave school at 8:00 p.m.
progress of integrating to their culture .
Last week , we went to The Mountain Fuji .
The mountain was half - melted with glacier on top .
I have never seen such scenery like that in my country since the climate in South China is humid and hot .
The same goes to me .
When we play football , we are definitely will cooperate with the other teammates in order to be the winner .
The one who is in the back position will try their hard to block the opponent teammates from scoring while those who play in the attacking position will make up their strategy in order to score .
This clearly shows that football needs a strong cooperation from all of the team 's players .
My advice to those who are starting this sport is to practise a lot as football needs an unstoppable practice to master the game and be the king of field .
My second advice for them is to always have a cooperative game with the teammates .
The worst player is those who do not put their trust in the other teammates and the best one is them who put their full trust in their teammates .
Scuba diving obviously is one of the most exciting and thrilling sports on earth .
I surely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiast members , not only bringing a unique experience into your life , but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues towards a broad public .
The downside of this is that hordes of eager newly trained divers populate the underwater world , often with little clue of the life - threatening risks that they are facing .
From my point of view it should rather be seen as a license to learn .
Consequently I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport .
To my great astonishment I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again .
I saw dive - buddy 's and even professional dive masters pushing and stimulating fresh divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
You can imagine that it is really traumatic for divers when they encounter a corpse in the water , not to mention the great distress such a disaster gives to the family that was left behind .
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal education and practice .
I love to teach because I love to learn and love to share my knowledge with others .
A successful communication between different cultures will happen only when we express oueselves precisely and interpret the information accurately .
Students should master language skills , with which the students can achieve their academic goals .
Acquiring a language and culture is a long - term process , which includes learning , practicing , making mistakes and correcting .
As a language teacher , I hope my students will have a deeper and broader understanding of this language , their interest in this language will be stimulated by the course and learn the language constantly .
Fame is a side effect of job in the media and so is spine disease for people who work in an office or threat to life or health for firefighters .
It would be completely pointless if we were judging people on the basis of job they have .
Everyone is equal so everyone deserves the same .
People who decide to work in show - business or media have to be aware of having less privacy .
what is inseparable part of this kind of occupations .
Because of their fame , they also give employment to other people like paparazzi , journalists .
We live in times where people are very curious about other people 's lives so above - mentioned occupations are necessary ,
but let 's think ... is it really so interesting to know , for example , what Madonna 's second husband eat for breakfast ?
Would we , not - famous , people want that kind of interest ?
Let 's step into famous people shoes .
So let politicians , film stars , singers and others be .
Michael had been running on fumes all week .
Besides being in charge with organizing his younger sister 's surprise birthday party he had also been put in charge with the entire Information Technology department of the company he worked for .
His former boss retired and nominated him for the position , claiming he was more than qualified and had the adequate skill set in order to keep the department on track as well as making any necessary changes .
The truth was he had been expecting a promotion in a nearby future just not in this precise week .
Michael did n't mean to sound ungrateful , because he was delighted , but the timing was n't anything but the worst .
The only problem was that it seemed nothing was going to work on his favour , the servers had crashed and he was the one who had to fix it .
As soon as one problem in the company would be solved another one just as infuriating would come up at the party planning .
He was exhausted so he decided to go home , let his mother deal with the party and any problems would be taken care of by his co - workers .
It was risky ; he knew it but had no energy left in him .
The scope of this report is to give readers an overview in the historical development of water treatment , the changing perception of standardization of water treatment , and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored .
Clean and adequate water supply system is vital aspect in public health and social prosperity .
It is essential for all forms of life by which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients , removal of metabolic waste , and body temperature regulation .
Water treatment must meet requirements for public and industrial standards .
Mithen 's ( 2010 ) researches show that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport .
Although an understanding of water quality was not well understood , the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Siculus provided early documents of purifying water such as boiling and sand filtration , dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greek .
Since microbiology was yet studied , people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water .
The main precaution measure was purely by judging turbidity of the water and this false practice had remained ever since , even nowadays .
It took years for people to recognize that their sense of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality .
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 2500 years ago in Iran , a sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater .
For example , in 1933 the capital city of Iran , Tehran , drew its entire water supply system using the same principle of qunats , though with a lot more complications added into it .
These complications were primarily caused by pollution in the underground water which was previously unknown .
Unlike the past , where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene ; with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .
The history of water treatment continued in 1670 , as two Dutch glasses makers investigated on magnification glasses led to the invention of the microscope .
This scientific discovery broken down the barrier and enables biologist to observe organism that were invisible to the naked eye ( Figure 2 ) .
The " Chachas " is a restaurant situated in a mall in a fringe area of Bern .
People of all ages and cultures eating there .
The restaurants ' slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially if you set your foot into the restaurant for the first time .
This being said , you can imagine the atmosphere being comfortably airy .
Sitting at any table you can watch the chefs preparing the fresh food .
Assembled around those long tables , you will find the smaller tables and even a cosy lounge for people waiting for a free table .
The menu offers a wide range of mouth - watering thai - food dishes including starters , curries , noodles and desserts .
Another aspect I would like to emphasise on is the service .
The waiters go out of their ways ' .
They are courtous and industrious .
And as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food , I highly recommend going to the " Chachas " restaurant .
There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people illustrate a different identity in facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in a social media and having the sense of audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online thereby .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a way of self - expression that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three ways of self - presentations in most social media : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
Examining teens ' identity construction in social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a way of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
If the weblog - writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle , through using the first person pronoun , or tell their stories through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammatical subjects , is among the focuses of this study .
The children were playing outside , old and new couples were enjoying their love and everything seemed to be absolutely bright .
They had plans for the future before .. he thought he would have married her .
And then severything had crashed .
Michael tried not to think about it and to listen instaed to what she was saying ...
Her voice was weak and fleble while she said " .. and I was really depressed , you know and then I thought ... we always talked about going in India ... and I thought ... maybe we could fix everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. will you go with India with me ? "
But suddenly he thought he was really angry with her .
" I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to hear from you anymore " he said , and then stood up and without watching her walked out of the bar .
As you know I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have a hands - on experience in organising a cultural festival and particularly musical concert .
I loved my job there and if I only had an opportunity to do it again , I definitely would .
During my staying there I was responsible for taking care of musicians and contacting media .
What I especially loved about my job there , was the opportunity to work in such a diverse group of people .
I also appreciated much the practical experience I could get there - how to organise job at the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want , how to use social media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate with press and television etc .
It is known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear or even the tattoos they have .
This happens because some people is famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do in their holdidays , for example , if they work properly when they have to .
But I think there is an exception : monarchy .
I think Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by all the citizens , so I think we ( as citizen ) have the right to know eveything they do if we want .
It happens that one day a friend of mine took me to a Film Club session .
Meanwhile , Elen was going to receive a birthday present from her boyfriend , Ken : a house for both to live .
At first , Ken , had thought about giving some cruise tickets as a present .
A house for them to live !
Ken was not a small guy , short hair , sharp teeth and nose , light skin , blond hair and sky - blue eyes .
That day was the day , Elena 's birthday , and Ken was n't sure how to give that massive present when suddenly he had an excellent idea .
When Elena took it off she was blown away , completely amazed with what she saw .
Elena could n't be happier with the situation .
That morning , Michael woke up full of energy , and feeling very optimistic about his first day in his new job .
Every single detail should be perfect to get the best first impression .
-You only have one opportunity to cause a good first impression- he said to himself .
When he was totally satisfied with his look he turned on and off the light of his bedroom eight times .
When he arrived the receptionist told him to go to his boss office .
-Yes , come in , please- .
He liked her at first .
She was a very kind and intelligent woman , and Michael was sure that she was going to be a perfect boss and they will work very easily together .
After the meeting and when he was leaving he turned back and said : -
And congratulations for the baby!- His boss looked at him in anger:- Do you think that I am pregnant?- .
-No , no , I mean ... , I do n't think you are pregnant at all- .
Our city offers to visitors a huge range of possibilities to go shopping .
If you are crazy about fashion but your budget is really short , there are a lot of second - hand shops where you can buy a lot with a little money .
Window shopping through our high street is another option .
Here you will find all trendy brands and much more .
For example , people interested in cooking has some gourmet shops where they will be able to taste our traditional products .
A must for all tourists although they do n't want to buy anything is the oldest shopping centre in the country .
Other modern malls are located in the suburbs but do n't worry , our city has an excellent public transport service to get there .
When the weather is good , especially during spring , market street are really popular .
It is celebrated on the mother 's day on May , the first Sunday and it is located in the city 's longest avenue , around a kilometre plenty of flowers where you can make your own bouquet for your mother 's present .
These are some ideas to enjoy shopping while you are visiting our city but there are much more to discover !
Yes , that 's true that the car is far more convenient than the public transport .
When you 're driving your own car you are getting a lot of comfort .
You are sitting on a comfortable seat .
And you never , ever , will contact with other people .
You have not wait till it arrives and it is never late .
Your car will always go to the right place -- no transport changes , no awkward routes .
But -- will it always be the best choice ?
When you want to travel the world or just going to visit your parents , which are two thousand miles from you , it would be better to take a bus or a train .
So in that case it 's better to leave your car at home .
And what if the car you 're driving will break ?
Just imagine that you are sitting in the broken car , at night , without any sign of a car service for fifty miles around you !
High cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation .
On short distances , maybe one or two hundred miles , a car is ideal .
But if you take a big journey alone , you 'd better take an old good bus , just like 100 years ago .
People would say that travelling on public transport it is the future for our lives .
But sincerely there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more a more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seekers and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to deal with the day - to - day tasks we very often find travelling by our own car it is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling with children it is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved .
Waiting at the bus station for our next bus after just roughly missing the last one , being stuck in the middle of a crowd trying to reach the same train as everyone else , does n't make us life any easier at all .
At the en of the day we decide to use our car , as the way we live today combining work , family and hobbies all at once , cars becoming mobile houses seem to be our best option .
You wanted to know what I was said to do before and during the concert , so I try to explain everything .
The concert took place in Los Angeles , it was a month ago as I think . You can be sure that I had a time of my life .
Everything was so exciting about helping at this concert .
I had to take care of other volounteers .
Dealing with other people is the hardest part , escpecially when they 're the same age as you .
There were people from Russia , Germany , Brasil .
That was really great to meet them and to talk with them .
Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything works well : the sound , the lightning and the instruments .
I particularly enjoy the sense of freedom that it gives me : there 's nothing better than being out on the water with only the sound of the waves , and of the wind on the sails .
In my experience I found that people either consider sailing a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
Indeed people can get bored while sailing , if they just sit and do n't interact with the rest of the crew ,
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on , for me a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also kind of people s / he can possibly have to deal with .
So the most important piece of advice I would give to everyone is : try ,
and if the first time is not so good , try again : in different weather conditions , with different people , and different kind of boats .
Maybe you will not get addicted to it as much as I am , but I 'm sure you will have a great time , and in the worst case you will have the chance to meet wonderful people .
First of all public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities .
Nowadays environmental pollution is also important that 's why public transport should be promoted as environmentally friendly way of transport .
Not always car is much more convenient , for example in a big city it is far more convenient to use underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it 's impossible .
In my opinion nowadays driving a car is very stressful because of traffic intensity .
Driving a car is also more tiring , driver must be concentrated all the time .
Of course not always public transport is more convenient .
When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside car is irreplecable for families with children or animals .
Also go on holidays by car can be very comfortable .
With car we are more independent than with public transport .
There are many pros and cons but for sure we ca n't say that there is no future for public transport .
This summer I am bringing a group of 12 to 14 year - old students to Athens and I am looking for suitable accommodation .
At present I am uncertain about the number of the students , but it will probably be about 15 .
While we are there , we not only want to look at the many attractions in the city , but we would like to visit some of the beautiful places nearby , so we are looking for a reasonable priced hotel , in the city centre , with good transport links .
During our stay we require the following : twin - bedded rooms , in the same hotel , breakfast and on occasion , evening meal .
Furthermore I would like to ask you if there are any individuals who can be able to look after groups like us ?
Also it would be great if you could inform me of some special discounts , such as cheaper air travelling .
The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to elevate the website aesthetic and improve user - friendliness .
A survey was conducted among the 200 people who filled the complaints .
The majority of people were of opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised .
Others problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website , connection issues and login problems , particularly correct credentials not working .
Implement a tutorial to facilitate the usability for new users , and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request .
Conduct a survey on a minimum of one thousand people on what features should the website include .
Although it had been a tiring day she was very pride of that little sheet of paper .
No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss the latter was quite astonished .
The next days the boss ordered her to write an article about the natural beauties of Colombia , a little State located in South America .
She used to live in a flat so she had never disovered how much the world was different and beautiful .
That evening she met with a local guide she was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization .
The following day she came back to London where all her family was waiting for her since they werevery curious about the weird Alison 's trip .
All over the world people of different ages are very fond of sport and games .
It gives us much pleasure and many moments of joy .
They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sport events , but they do n't go in for sports .
There are a lot of kinds of sports such as swimming , wrestling , cycling , box , football , hockey , track and field athletics and so on .
This is very popular sport and very useful for your health .
You slow run and enjoy the beauty of nature around .
This kind of sport is getting more and more popular over the world .
If you go to Europe you can see a lot of people who go in for jogging .
Speaking about sport I ca n't help saying about football , because this is very spectacular kind of sports .
Some football players are world famous ; they make excellent careers and take part in each championship .
Perhaps , they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting .
There are different types of extreme sports , for example , rock climbing , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboarding , parachuting , hang - gliding , bungee jumping etc .
However , they become more and more popular even among the beginners .
Doing such sports people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency .
In skysurfing you jump out of an airplane and use a board to " surf " the air , doing gymnastics in mid - air !
Winter sports have always an element of danger .
For example snowboarding , which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even than skiing .
If you want to feel fit you 'd better go in for one kind of sport or another .
I think that everyone must do all to be healthy .
To tell the truth I do n't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life .
In summer I go swimming as there is a beautiful pond with pure water where my Granny lives .
In winter I go in for skating .
If I have free time I go to the nearest skating - rink with my friends and we have much pleasure , skating together .
On the other hand , there are programmes which bring nothing new into our life .
Therefore , one should not waste time watching tem .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others alike have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment .
All in all , it is my belief that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose what to see , television can have an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us , and in particular , in the life of the ones who can not afford travelling , buy books or live in an educated environment .
If you are looking for a film that provides you with suspense and action at the same time , I recomend you to watch " Now you see me " .
The film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about four magicians , known as " The Four Horsemen " that join together by a mysterious benefactor , and during their presentations they do all kind of illegal stuff , such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss .
Because of them , there 's an agent of the FBI , Dylan Rhodes , that persecute them through different states of EE.UU .
They are capable of making you think they really know how to illusion someone .
Morgan Freeman is the best actor of all times and perfect for the role of developer tricks and helper of the FBI to catch the " Four Horsemen " .
Also there is no other better for the role of agent as Mark Ruffalo .
But it 's not just the acting that it 's great in the film .
So if you enjoy magic tricks , surprises , very handsome actors and splended actresses , why would you miss it ?
What I did not in Vacations
During vacations I did n't enjoy my time because I did n't find out that I am a wizard .
Sadly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga nor Justin Timberlake .
I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during vacations .
I did not go to Hogwarts not turn my brother into a frog .
As aliens did n't kidnap me I did not travel all around the galaxy during this vacations week .
After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York nor hang out with her and Justin Timberlake .
We three counldn't sing together nor make laugh of Kim Kardashian .
Indeed , what I did in vacations was sleep the whole day , hang out with my " Unfamous " friends and write and compose two and a half songs .
But , lets face it doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or singins a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
We will be travelling by car to a campsite in Gemany .
Even though it is a large campsite it feels small and cosy .
Some hikes are short , but steep and some hikes are long and involves no climbing at all .
Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she is Rachel 's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marries Chandler ) .
Rachel has always been daddy 's little girl but , when she brakes her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera , she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gets a job related to fashion world after a few years ) .
Joey is ... well , he 's Joey : not so clever , a great one for the girls and -the most important- Chandler 's best friend .
The most interesting thing of ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the love story between Ross and Rachel : the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her .
Living without Internet : Is it possible ?
From 7 am to 7 pm , my computer is running surfing the Internet .
Not only I use it for leisure , but I also use it for work . I would have to change the way I do things on a daily basis .
Will have to start buying magazines and newspapers to be informed ?
My daily routine is based on having access to the Internet : talking to my friends , reading he newspapers , the forecast weather , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
The wrong choice can lead to a big mistake that can influence on our life and people around us .
What if that the boy could be smarter than he himself ?
The only way was to show and prove everyone that he was the best .
So , he decided to ignore him absolutely .
He did n't answer to his questions and did n't want to use all his ideas .
The work was done and Michael was proud because everything was done by himself .
He praised the Michael 's work .
They both left the office soon .
Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organizations ?
When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?
First thing I 'd do if I want to make a donation is go on the internet , and search Google for rare diseases .
Then I 'll look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure .
I 'll be left with a lot to choose from , so I 'll see which illness is the hardest to endure and choose this one to donate my money to .
This makes me realize that even if I have a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm still better than others and I 'm grateful .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations , to the ones who need more help .
It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their face .
We should all be thankful we are what we are , because we could be a lot worse .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient airway is opened .
Also , this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours of post surgery , is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse need to maintain the cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help in this issue , the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
I would like to start saying it is free .
The second advice is you should try to find the best places to walk around you .
The sightseeing is very important once you start walking .
Do not forget to greet me when we met on the road .
All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles , learning levels and achievements as well as motivation , personality , and pace of learning .
While conducting a need analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation in learning English .
After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual 's needs .
Through teamwork , students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .
It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students .
Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels .
Finally , preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning .
Students have more opportunities to learn languages , discover foreign experience , pass internships and study abroad .
Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including arts , music , literature etc .
In Ukraine young people are different too .
We can define it by list of TOP music charters on music channels .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and now is developed very fast .
It 's interesting to admit that there is fashion on Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " now .
I hope after reading of my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality .
Also I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sightseens , to feel culture and speak to nice people !
It 's a small town and there are not too many options of travelling by public transport .
If you want to go to Vigo or other city which is near , the coach service is a good and not too expensive option .
The coaches are slow , so most of the people prefer the car .
If your destiny is further away , another good option is to travel by train .
Train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages will help a lot of people , especially the older ones .
Dear Mr./Ms .
I have been learning English for 5 years and I hope to take the FCE ( Cambridge exam ) soon . I also write a blog about art on English .
As a member of student club at my college , my responsibility is to organize events and collaborate with many students from different departments .
Working on projects help me improve my organizational and planning skills .
For the beginning , short and animated movies would be the best , such as movie " Validation " that teaches us how words have the power to change our lives .
With my experience and range of skills I am sure I can contribute to your idea and organise great movie nights .
I am happy that you have chosen to spend the following year in my country .
I am sure that you will find in Brazil a perfect fit .
As a country with one of the longest coastline in the world , I definitely would recommend you to know the beautiful beaches we have .
I would also recommend you to know the city of Rio de Janeiro , there you will find beautiful beaches , wonderful weather and the wonders of nature in a modern and international city .
You will be amazed by " Cristo Redentor " and " Corcovado " , I have no words to explain how beauty they are .
Another very good option is exploring Brazil 's Northeast , as beautiful as Rio de Janeiro is .
Most of the biggest American companies are in Brazil for a long time and as an English native speaker it will be easier to you to find and internship .
The nine months that you will spend travelling around Brazil will give you a better understanding of Portuguese and that will be an advantage to you find a new job here .
I have many tips to share with you , I 'll be glad to do it in person when you arrive .
Once again , there is no other better place the world to spend this time you have available .
If you prefer shopping outshide , taking a trip to King Street would be the the thing to do .
If you want typical souvenirs , you can go to the Buckingham Palace , you will find a lot of small shops that sell souvenirs for a reasonnable price .
As you know I enjoyed helping at a concert last week .
It was really exhausting , but illuminating experience .
We tried to make everyone had fun .
There were many visitors from other countries , so we often had to translate the conversation and help in communication .
But the most memorable was a meeting with the stars of the concert .
I could n't be more excited about being for six months in the UK !
I agree with you that I 'm brave , but I think I need this time to relax after all that problems that I had with my grandmother .
I 'm planning to improve my English and I have already registered for a course .
My classes will happen from Monday to Friday , but just in the mornings .
I 'm sure that I will enjoy visiting all that famous castles and churches .
Besides that , I would love travelling to other European countries .
If you ca n't go with me , I think we can go out some nights .
I have a high level of spoken English , as I have been learning it since early chidlhood .
On graduation , I spent two years working as a supplementary education teacher .
My tasks have included organizing sports and other activities for children .
I was also in charge of providing safe and entertaining interection .
Dancing is something that human beings always did , in one way or another .
Since I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so graciously .
On the other hand , I always loved classical music .
Luckily , we got a word of a dancing school .
That , by chance , happen to be near my town .
I spent four years doing one of the things I love the most , dancing .
This is a short story written by D. B. Caulfield , the big brother of Holden Caulfield who is the main character in The Catcher in the Rye from J. D. Salinger .
Some of the selected aspects for this assignment were the characteristics that Holden says he likes in others of his favorite books since this is one of them .
He does not like that his brother is " prostituting himself " by writing scripts for movies since he does not like movies .
I also noticed that one team is not writing anything .
When I approached them , they said they ca n't remember the exact words that were dictated .
Another team used the words to make sentences that are unrelated to the story .
The chairs were placed in a U shape which made it difficult for team members to discuss their ideas and to maintain eye contact .
Ss did n't know how much time they have to finish the task .
Of course , I originally came there to work : putting the chairs and tables right , ensuring that everyone in my appointed space was well - fed , and keeping an eye on the cash counter .
But I realise now that it 's quite late already and that I ought to sleep . I 'll write the rest to you as soon as I can ; I haven't told to the best part yet !

Given the learning experiences in the past two year 's school - based support , some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs , ELPS and Thinking Tools .
All of the above have been taken a good progress in developing P.1 - 4 school - based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for developing in P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum .
In view of these favourable conditions , higher expectations could be set to improve the learning progress and enhance the learning performance of NCS .
More collaborative efforts should be paid to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS .
Given the experiences gained in the support services , many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS .
The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans , unfortunately , there is no evidence of GMC 's being completely safe for human consumption .
It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the command of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports , leaving a cluster of questions without any answer .
Companies as Monsanto that engineers plants with steeril seeds , encourage non - sustainable production models that promote the extinction of independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era .
The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with the global food security .
In their quest for the perfect seed , genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds biodiversity , as stand by a research led by Greenpeace , GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non - modified crops .
It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have over our lives , but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them .
In conclusion , I would rather say that companies must reinforce our humanity before manipulating the environment in such a radical manner .
A survey was carried out in the most populated Italian cities and 2000 citizens were interviewed on 22nd October to quantify their interest in such segment of the national TV schedule with the following results :
• 40% of those interviewed , most of which have proven to be young people , declared they watch English - language TV programmes at least five times a week ;
• 30% of them stated they watch them at most twice a week , but they would so more often if they were subtitled ;
Besides , avoiding the dubbing process , episodes can be seen in concert with their original airing .
Although the importation of such programmes has produced positive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also produced negative outcomes .
I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised , to be able to reply to the threat represented by low price imported ones .
One intelligent person once said : ' The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page . '
I totally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lot because our world is incredible .
Even just in cities , let it alone travelling at long distances .
But , on the other hand , traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient .
Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport .
Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma , allergy and even cancer .
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( at least , use public transport ) because it is environmentally friendly !
The difference in work meetings between the British and France are that the British want to make decisions and the France way more like a debate , as is written in a guide for Franco - British business relationships .
This in contrast to the guide " Light at the End of the Tunnel : Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business " published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain .
The by the UK 's Foreign Office in 1944 published booklet " instructions for British Serviceman in France " is still useful for the most , nowadays .
The late actor Louis de Funès is mentioned as a role model by the chamber of commerce 's guide .
When you get hired by a British employer it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports .
In France the level of education is the main reason for hiring someone .
British does n't speak out what they are thinking , in contrast to the Dutch .
In 1995 the French came to notice that their languish was n't enough for doing business worldwide .
This is one of the reasons why most French under 50 does n't speak English very well .
International relationships are built by people who can speak the same languish and who are at the same level of their vocabulary .
The native speakers seek each other out , the British come together with the Americans and the French well … they are on their own .
If the French and British spoke the same languish evenly , the trade would go up by 44 per cent .
It 's no use to teach French on schools , because the French only except near native speakers .
It 's better to talk British and force it on them .
I live in a small town called Grycksbo and I 've been part of Unga Kris volunteering programs since the summer 2010 .
Now that I have been volunteering for a while , my expectations have changed : Unga KRIS is still a place where I expect to have fun and meet new people but I also expect to grow even more as a person , to take on responsibilities and face my fears in different social situation . »
In many cases , volunteers are crucial to help maintain life , as when meals are delivered to homebound people .
It 's something that makes part of our grow to adulthood .
When I was nineteen , I started and ran my own business , for me , was one of the most exciting choices that I made .
Of course , without the full support of my family I could n't have done it .
At first , I found it as an exhilarating and rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
But it was n't enough , the fact of the matter was that I ignored that being self- employed entailed self - sacrifice , devoting my time , energies and a great deal of patience with the customers , it was so hard!.
Things gradually improved day by day for a time and my reneues stated growing .
So I did n't mind working against time and long hours .
During the next ten years , I was thrilled about the fact to put aside in order to build our flat step by step .
When I got married , things quickly went from bad to worse because I had to work at two shifts , at home and the shop .
As a matter of fact Budapest , the capital city of Hungary can be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event .
Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location .
The obsolete trams and trolleys had been replaced .
Bicycle trails can criss - cross the city .
2 . ) Airport Hotel is the most adjacent accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport .
The admission 's tickets to the most of Budapest 's museums are comparatively cheap .
The main concern is related to petty crime , especially the pickpocketing .
In addition , the homeless people have to sleep in the street .
The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people .
The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle the crime .
In conclusion it would be a good idea and a viable way through sponsorships .
Moreover , this would be advantageous both for hosting city and the tourists .
I had just graduated the Academy and was on my summer holidays .
By that time I had visited six interviews , but nobody was interested in my candidacy .
I decided to go to my parents and spend a few weeks helping them with a renovation of their house .
At first I did not understand anything and I had decided that it was a mistake .
But then I remembered when I was 15 I 've sent my scientific work to the Patent service .
It turned out that they send my work to a few Instituts and one of them was interested in me .
That day was a start of my scientific career .
In 50 years ' time , maybe not all of the natural resources will have been used up , but most of it then will have been exploited .
I 'm completely sure that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth , although our life styles will have changed a lot .
So , is it really worth it getting away from it all and setting off on a journey around the world or taking their first job ?
Moreover , they feel they have to make the most of their time to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love .
Therefore , they choose a job that is related to a hobby or sport so that they can learn from and earn money at the same time .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and taking a year gap before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people 's perspective to life and will help them become more confident with what they really love .
Luckily enough , they may end up working in another country or their hobby could become their career .
I learned somewhere that the best thing to make a path through your writing is to start tipping .
I 'm not sure if this is true or wrong , because simply I 'm not here to judge or comment on the authenticity of the statement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through writing .
How can one know they got the talent ?
How can one know they have the guts ? what I believe , and think it 's true , is that braveness , boldness as well as callousness make people write truly what they think , without any lies , without any camouflage and without any kind of burnished layers .
Writers often make their masterpieces shiny and glowing in order to make it more acceptable by people , less shocking to them and less close to the reality from which readers had the intention to escape when they have picked that piece of writing in the first place .
Thus , bad natural personality can be the seed of crime .
On the other hand , I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst for illegality .
It means that a number of law offenders can not sustain their livelihood , and they desperately experience limited options to earn money .
As a result , they are easily drawn by the allure of wealth , which leads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnapping or drug trafficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
In addition , the prevalence of social media such as television or the internet is partially to blame .
This is particularly common among young people who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the position that crime occur due to social media and poverty .
In the past people used technology as a tool for making survival an easier endeavor .
Nowadays we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it turned to a means of communication and entertainment .
At the same time this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society , is the use of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communication between people ?
Whenever you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it made face - to - face interaction and communication between people nonexistent .
This is true in many aspects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people with texting and social networks .
This leads , among other things , to the ability for people to be lonely , as having too many virtual friendships causes the inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The young generations in our society are participating in a massive , unintentional social experiment the results of which are not entirely predictable .
Nowadays , society tends to prejudge others just because of their actions and without knowing the real motive of the behaviour .
But with Colton 's quotation , we can clearly see that it has happened since years .
In our current society we can see it daily .
Lot of children got their hair cut as their favourite football players , others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act as their role model , just because they all do have something in common : they admire those people .
Flattering is different , it is easier to recognize .
Nowadays , in some determinate cases , people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted , they flatter .
When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams , I think there are only two ways : influences or flattery ; and to be honest I do n't know what I prefer .
To sum up , I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation , to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be .
But there are some lines ... that are way too dangerous to cross .
If you 're willing to take the chance ... the view from the other side is spectacular .
A way that no one ever seems to tells you about .
I am really interested in martial arts , such as Aikido , Judo and self - defense that I have already practiced .
There are some that do not need too much forces and strengths , such as Thai chi and others that need more like Karate , Judo , and so .
the First advantage of martial arts is to improve self - confidence .
You will get ready to fight with others , regardless their strengths , ages and so on .
When you do a technique successfully on your opponent , you feel more confidence .
Second advantage of doing martial arts is how to respect others .
Every time , you do a technique you have to show your respect to opponent , and also other ranks , regardless to their age .
Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body ; eyes , hands and legs .
When you do a technique or defense against a technique , you control your body 's movement and coordinate them to work in the same time .
Some people think there are some disadvantages like injury , and getting aggressive .
People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy , and also to respect .
I suggest that everyone should try martial sports .
But before starting , you supposed to evaluate your needs and your health condition .
The original work was written by the mathematical , logical and British writer Lewis Carroll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created through logic games , and , therefore , it is understandable the success it has achieved in the most varied environments .
The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent adapted to the present time , such as , the White Rabbit , Mad Hatter , the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts .
One of the biggest differences with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters .
The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to let your imagination in the same way that when you read the book .
However , I strongly recommend going to see this play because it has a great appeal to both adults and children .
Like what was once , I have no doubt that this world of wonders will remain important in the coming years .
" Encourage learner autonomy - the teacher wo n't always be there to provide answers " Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish .
This lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to the classmates what activities need to be done .
This time in order to further reduce my TTT I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well .
I hope by handing over the complete control to the class this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negation . techniques
The amount of talking done by the students was more that pleasing .
They enjoyed being the"boss " and giving telling other students what to do .
I had an exact copy of what the students had on their clue cards on a separate piece of paper this time rather than in the lesson plan its self .
This made every thing seem less cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required an action from me on my copy of the clues e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise .
Giving the students the answers the exercises was a partially efficient way to encourage the students to speak more .
This is the first time I have tired this method and I neglected to leave the students extra time to be able to benefit fully from the exercise .
The enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off .
In heinz sight giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point ( past modals ) was not the best choice .
The next time I do this lesson I would use a more skills based lesson with perhaps a listening or a short reading .
If grammar was part of the lesson It would need to be a point that is being revised .
Despite having timing issues , I feel that thus far this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT .
I throughly enjoyed the lesson and according to student feedback , so did they .
It 's a city where you can recreate a part of the European history , thanks to the ancient and magnificent building , and where you can enjoy the last technologies and have fun .
I suggest visitin the Vatican , as I said at the beginning ; the county inside the city .
Inside it , we can find the well known sistine chapel , I ca n't tell you how it is , because last year when I went , there was a changeover of pope , and it was closed and I could n't entry .
On the other hand , there are more places to visit , as the Coliseum or something else .
Whatever happens , I 'm sure , you 'll enjoy the city .
Furthermore , if you go in summer , you should go to a lively area and be with the interesting and nice people , but like every city , be careful with the rough areas .
Despite the people 's opinions , if you have the opportunity to go , do n't throw it away , and check it for yourself .
As the majority of you I have friends who are still around me since many years ago although we do n't see each other regularly , others simply have softly become less important and some luckily have recently entered my life .
With any doubt a good friend is a treasure .
Counting on someone capable of understanding your demands , who shares with you the innermost feelings and who is able of discussing possible misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
As the saying goes " A friend in need is a friend indeed " .
If you respect your friends then they will respect you .
In other words , no matter how far you live , a good friend will always support to you .
Curiously , you never know where will you find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe attends to the same sport lessons than you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprising the amount of nice people next to you sometimes , and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you have now new friends .
As I said before every moment in your life is different as your friends probably are too .
Hi!How are you ? Have you found your car keys ?
Or has it ran away ?
I wanted to write to you earlier , but we had my sisters ' birthday party and I had an allergic reaction from something I 've never eaten before .
At first we did n't know what was it from , then I realized that the cake had blue berries , and I 've never eaten one before .
After we ate the cake , I found my mom looking at me an screaming:"Oh !
I did n't know was happening , and why they were acting like this .
Suddenly I felt my whole body itching me , mom took me upstairs .
When I looked at the mirror , my face was spotted with red spots and it kind of turned purple , when I looked at my hands and my arms , it was all red from my fingers when I was scratching them , and the parts that were n't red , they were spotted like my face .
Anyways , mom gave me a medicine(I do n't know what it is ) , and a cream for my arms and hands because they were turning blue .
And do n't be afraid , I 'm okay , and I decided to check on everything from blue berries .
How is the experience of learning another language ?
The learning of our mother tongue language is a long term process that everyone has to be involved in .
However , who is skilled in speaking a foreign language has a huge advantage in a competitive and worldwide society .
On the one hand , I have been learning English for so long that my good profeciency have given me the chance to get a position in an international work team .
On the other hand , I have learned French and Spanish just for a few months , because I was curious to learn the oficial language of the countries , where friends and relatives are living in .
I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about me .
As a student of these classes , especially , of English ; I realized that , although the classes were important , a systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and , moreover , for maintaining it .
Nevertheless , learning another language has many benefits , such as the ability in living and visiting countries with different languages , meeting foreign people , working in an international environment , reading books or websites in other languages , etc .
Bauer 's fourth novel is an originally surprising thriller which includes an astonishing view of Aspergen syndrome from the prospective of Patrick , a trainee medicine student .
With the tender age of 18 and coping with his eccentric social code and all the possible courage , Patrick moves from his mother 's house to a rented flat in Cardiff to pursue his greatest dream , work in the Anatomy Department at Cardiff University .
The writer lets us observe the fear , anxiety and the defenceslessness of Sam , a neurological patient who is just beginning to emerge from its comatose state and has yet to deal with the reality of his new situation , sorting out pieces of memories involving relatives and not quite understanding why a woman he does n't know anything about claims to be his wife .
Patrick performances brilliantly the autopsy of Sam and finds out shocking information which leads the reader to the discovery of tragic and incidental deaths of neurological patients involving all at once doctors , nurses and patient 's relatives .
In this task , Patrick will be helped out by Lexi , the daughter of his autopsy corpse , to throw some light out of the creepy suspicion of medical mistreatment and their darkest consequences .
Everything started with some attacks here and there but no one really knew what was happening , so the attacks were tagged as " animal attacks " .
But when they became more frequent and witnesses described huge , flurry , dark and terrifying creatures with blood - shot eyes , panic grew over the population .
Government authorities told people to stay calm and a curfew was established , but Peter was on the camping holiday with his best friends and only heard this when they met another group of people that , fortunately , had a radio .
In order to be stronger in number , they befriended those people and helped each other .
The new group worked very well together but there was this girl he just could n't stand at all .
" It 's the end of the world , and I have to spend it with you ? " he whispered , the night had already fallen and they did n't want any unwanted visitors .

Dear Paul , you are right , it is really a brave step but you know how much is terrible the situation in Italy and I have decide to come to the UK to improve my cv as well .
At the moment I am struggling with the translation of my cv .
I am wondering if you could help me by giving me some tips to write a perfect cv , or at least acceptable .
I have just found a cheap accommodation in a hostel which is very convenient to all the facilities .
Even though I am shy and I like my privacy , I think that during this experience it will be better to have contacts with foreign people to practise my spoken English as much as possible .
Now let 's talk about the good things .
The aim of this experience is also having fun and great time with you .
For example , what about going for some walks across the countryside or renting a bike ?
I know that the country is really lovely there .
Ok , I have told you everything and I really should finish packing !
I am rather lazy as a person , I ca n't say I really enjoy sports in general but I definitely love walking .
I think it 's so effective : having a long walk on the green hills that surround my town , breathing deeply , enjoying the perfume of nature and the wonderful sights and colours of flowers and trees , it 's the best for me to clear my mind .
There 's no special advice to give to somebody who wants to start this activity : if you aim doing something good for your health and for your mind , just wear comfortable clothes , put your pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiring place and just go and enjoy any minute of it .
I would recommend 30 min per day , to get the most of this activity : it does n't take too much of your spare time and you 'll get great benefits from it .
It 's very cheap as well : except for your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortable trainers , it does n't require any extra cost for technical or sophisticated equipment .
I think this is a very good experience to you because you can learn about another culture and people 's way of thinking .
So , I suggest you try to get a working holiday visa of Korea .
As you know , if you have normal tourism visa , you ca n't work .
In Korea , we have many kinds of work which is related to English , so you can get a job easliy .
Also , if you want to work more specific place such as electric company , public office and so on , you can apply to internship programme .
If you get the intership , you can work as a real businessman .
In summer , you can enjoy many activities on the beach and also you can go hiking .
Especially , I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
It is the most popular place that people want to go .
If you want to know more information about Korea , let me know and I do n't mind checking your plan to go Korea .
It was a winter night .
Not only was it going to change my life , but also other person 's life .
When we arrived at the police office , I met an officer called Michael .
Nevertheless , the police had found out the buried body .
Michael asked me where I had been at the time of the crime and I answered him that I had been at home having a rest with a friend who could bear out the alibi .
While the interview , I realised the different ways I would use to get away if I were alone .
Fortunately , Michael , who had n't thought that option , left the interrogation room .
With over two hundred thousand dollars in his bag he was a giant walking target .
Ragged and worn , it certain had seen better days .
Travelling farther down he found his destination , a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog .
A police officers car was zooming in his direction , sirens blaring .
To begin with , I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday o to move themselves around the city or town because they feel free and do n't have to pay attention to the timetable .
But , on the other hand , when they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train o a plane because you arrive faster and you need n't find a place to park your car and if you want to go somewhere you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground .
Anyway , I do n't think public transport has no future , but public transport is used on different occasions from before and when you go to a place you know you wo n't be able to find a place to park and you ca n't waste time looking for where to park .
To make bank notes , the first step is to properly design it .
While background color and art work are thoroughly considered , security issues are one thing that we can not over look either .
After this , metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank notes printing , in which stage sheets are used to print ( each containing 50 bank notes ) .
Also , special ink is printed on both side of the sheet and the images are slightly raised .
Sheets in the second groups then get seperated into good ones , which , together with good quality sheets , enter a process of packaging and distribution where seperate notes are cut and finally enter the market , and bad ones , which go to disposal with bad quality sheets , where both groups get securely destroyed .
This leads us to a conclusion that the process of bank notes creation is secure as well as simple .
My boyfriend is the best in all the entire round world .
I met him two years ago in a party , and since that day my life has changed in many different ways .
When I first saw him I never imagined that I would love that stranger this way .
I have many memories with him , which I always keep on my heart even if they are god or bad .
One of them was the day we went to a concert of our favourite DJ , we had so much fun , we danced , kissed and sang like never before that night .
I love it .
Now on days , we are still together , and we are as happy as in our beginning .
As a secret I can tell you that I want to marry him so badly , I swear to god that my life would be much better if I can live all of it with him .
" It 's time for us to shine , " His handwritten words come to life in her mind .
She could distinctively hear his low , manly voice in her head .
His deep chuckles still made butterflies in her stomach .
Every movement seem to take a minute to execute .
The person was holding her wrist , preventing her from wiping any sweat on her face .
Wide eyed , red lips , rosy cheeks , broad - build and a little stubble on his chin , he looked incredible .
This blue eyes , were much darker with insecurity , doubt and mystery .
Her eyes gazed to his lips .
He must have applied some lip stick for it to be that red !
She knows , she knows and she knows it is so wrong to put all happiness , dreams and hopes on someone that may leave anytime but she could not help it .
First of all , let me tell the adavantages .
Next we could ask for help to our community . I have some books in my library I could donate .
I have them because I have paid for them , not for other particular reason .
In conclusion , we should provide free books to our students .

The streets were calmed and the lights were pleasant . Travelling at night was a pleasure in this town .
" So here we are " he said looking upward . "
We better do our exam as soon as we can "
They moved in the crowd that made several phone calls and talked about their busy life .
She looked around making faces at everyone around .
" You have to do your duty here too , remember ? We made a progress back in the other city "
She nooded and made another effort to look around .
Who could be ?
As usual , they were talking about illegal things
They came closer to the man .
The other person was n't convinced howewer .
They talked for hours one trying to convince the other , he was doing his best , but at the end , the other man declined .
When he finished talking he looked to the young couple in front of him
" What are you doing here pests ? !
" He made sure his voice was heard on the streets , to reafirm his social position .
The young couple grinned " You haven't heard about the mind hackers right ? "
He gasped and tried to scream but it was too late to run .
She looked on her laptop , where all the information in that man 's mind was displayed
" Bingo . We got a code "
She inspected the man looking for an Id. She took it and as soon as they got it , they let the man go , who fainted and will not remember anything that happened to his mind .
The thief couple made their way to the main building .
They entered the building with the aid of the ID and made use of the code to enter the interiors of the building .
They got with the receptionist
" Are you two the people who will make their skill test ? "
The couple nooded and showed the ID of the man from the other city .
The receptionist nooded and conducted both to the main hall .
It was disturbing as kids were also included .
One of the bosses in charge of such thing .
She felt somehow nervous " I know we are doing this to escape this inferno but ... I have a bad feeling about this " but it was too late .
They walked in to find a man looking through the window
" You two are finally here . I know who you are "
It was impossible they deleted every bit of information about themselves
" Did you think you two were going to make fun of me? ... "He pushed her backwards
" Welcome to your tombstone , hackers "
Just how a coin has two sides , television too , has its pros and cons .
Off late , debates in news channels are the talk of the town where u get to know what is happening in your country or neighborhood .
Such programs also allows us to participate by giving our feedback .
Gone are the days when tom mindlessly chased jerry .
presently we have many educational cartoons that teach kids how to draw , make crafts and even learn languages .
Home of the future will look more or less the same as the home of the present .
Even today processors are in almost every device : dishwashers , vacuum cleaners , television sets , even blenders .
It may sound silly , but I think it actually will make those devices more user friendly and functional .
Even now we can buy TV sets with Internet connection , so development of technology is not a problem .
But we have to ask ourselves why would we connect every device in our house to World Wide Web ?
Imagine you can programme your house to welcome you after a long day at work .
You come back and dinner is cooked , all your favourite programmes are recorded and ready to watch , Your bath is full of hot water and you can just relax .
Reassuming , while design of houses may look different the most important change will be in technology which will make our life easier .
It has already done but we still ca n't see the end of possibilities .
Firstly I would like to say that I have some experience in looking after children because I have worked at a local summer camp last summer .
As for my personality , I would like to mention that I am a funny person who enjoys telling jokes , making people laugh and even getting dressed as a clown to entertain others .
If you require any further information , I am available for an on line interview .
It 's no secret that there has been a decline in the use of transport such as taxis ever since cars became more affordable and your common Joe became capable of sustaining one , two or more per family , however , does that really mean that the future of public transport like buses is hopeless ?
Many affordable bus and metropolitan passes and other systems have also been created in order to motivate the citizens to use them , providing a quicker , and sometimes cheaper , alternative to their own transport .
Nothing was taking his attention .
It was n't only the smile , but the way she talked to him , the look in her eyes and her flirty attitude what had filled his stomach with tiny butterflies and , as he was going home , he started to realize the love running through his veins , right to the heart .
He picked up the keys from his pocket and approached carefully , holding his breath .
If you are a fan of romantic films , you probably do n't like this movie . " Palmeras en la nieve " is a Spanish film based on a book written by Luz Gabas which is about the life of a Spanish man who goes to Bioko to work and he falls in love with a native woman .
The problem with this movie is not the story because the book is fantastic and when you read it , you really can feel the emotions to the characters .
Furthermore , the main actors ' performance is not very good because they are not completely inside in their roles .
An example of that it 's the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song of Pablo Alboran , a Spanish singer .
Other good features are the customs and the landscapes which give to the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time
It 's been a long time since we last contact each other .
So , you do n't know what to do with your promel , do you ?
It 's an activity that you need to do every day , now that it 's a good way to keep fit .
The majority of people think of sport as a way to relax , to get thin or to keep fit .
It is in these moments where I give it my all , and realize that all the pratice I had really paid off .
This is why I suggest people to give swimming a try .
I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish , as your readers could be negatively biassed towards your paper only due to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , was very high .
The fist day was a great shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .
Much time lost could have been saved with a few phone calls , for example waiting for half an hour in a queue could have been prevented if a call had been made to the museum before we arrived there .
There are six main characters Ross , Monica , Rachel , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey .
On the other hand Joey and Chandler live together .
Joey is an actor and he is always making auditions without success .
And Chandler works in an office but he does n't really like his job .
Phoebe is the funniest of the group , she sings and plays the guitar but she is not very good at it .
Rachel and Monica have lived together since Rachel left her fiance on the altar .
She works in a restaurant as the head chef and she 's dating with a man twenty years older than her .
The six friends might not have the same opinion , they might argue , they might get angry with each other but they always forgive and forget !
In my opinion young people will love this show .
To sum up I really recommend you to see it , you 'll love it
I really recommend this movie , but if you plan watching it with your family , I do have to tell you that there is a lot of blood and killing in the film .
I can easily give it a five star rate because all of the events that happen seem real in the movie , and they are events that can happen in real life .
With no doubt all parents want their children to be citizen models .
However raising a child into a model citizen is extremely hard - working .
On one hand , parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child 's first contact .
Also , parents are like models to follow for their children , and as children do what they see they will copy their parents actions .
Indeed school is the first place where a children interacts with society .
Ultimately , teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents .
On the other hand , parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need , for example pay for their children school .
It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home , making the school responsibility to pass good social values .
To sum up , parents should take full responsibility for their children education .
However , one should take into account that a school with similar values to the ones of the parents would be a great help in the children raising process .
I am writing in regard to the advertisement published by you , to work in summer camps in the USA .
I would like to take part in this experience during the summer , as I will have my summer brake during that period .
I have taken part in a volunteer programme , looking after children 6 - 12 during the school term , and therefore I consider myself as having a good knowledge of children 's behaviour , that might be useful for the summer camp .
I am a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person , and I am also a very responsible person , able to deal with small and medium groups of children , and for this reason I consider myself as suitable for the potition advertised .
I am looking forward to taking part in this project , and enrich my personal curriculum through the participation in this project .
Looking forward to hearing from you , at your earliest convenience .
Restpectfully ,
Everything in this movie , Henri , is so simple and startling , but in the same time is hard to describe .
As time passes by , the relationship has so many ups and downs , but with consistent love and caring it ends with a strong bond that is n't easily broken .
In France , where the film is made , they call the handicapped , " White Butterflies " , which is definitely a better nomenclature than " People With Special Needs " and so many dishonored names .
The only reason I want to recommend this movie to you is because I want you to forget about all the action , thrilling , money making or good fighting evil .
My sole purpose is to help you enjoy the little things in your lives , appreciate the life and its simplicity with all its hidden fun and sad parts as well .
Unlock the door toward a new life and kick off your journey toward a whole new group of characters .
chase the childish dream of visiting a foreign country and get to know new aspects of life .
Check out how ordinary people , just like you and me , live each and every day , share their grief and problems , join them with their happy moments , get involved in their lives and be passionate and compassionate .
The aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course " Good design using DTP " so as to give an overall view of it .
The course took place in the Training center in Regent Street - London on the 14 - 15 of May , as scheduled .
All the participants , which were ten in total , were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught .
The tutor , Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way .
To begin with , he focused on design considerations with DPT , explaining what software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , layout and balance as well as graphics and logs .
Therefore , he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing .
The highpoint , however , was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension .
Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too , who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue .
In addition , in spite of having paid a lot , the participants were not allowed to take any materials away , and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants did n't have any materials to use to revise .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor .
Nowadays , many countries have been ruined areas of farmland , forest and wetland with the intention to construct housing and transport networks to cater to the demand of people .
There are many problems created by doing large - building projects , and it is the government 's responsibility to cope with these problems .
There are some unfavorable influence on people 's lives .
Because of the damage of farmland , forest and wetland , it is likely to lead to the pollution of water and air , which can cause the decrease of people 's living quality .
For example , in some areas , people have to wear a musk while having outdoor activities and they might need to purchase water from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively affect and thus they would feel less happy than other people lived in unpolluted areas .
The damage of habitats have affect animals in negative way .
They have to immigrate to another place since their homes are destroyed , and during the immigration most of them would die because of lack of water , high temperature or predators .
Besides , those animals who successfully arrive at proper place to live are likely to suffer from disease , because they did n't exposed to such a new environment before .
Although there are many people and animals are suffer from these problems , i do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be set to forbid some projects which cause massive problems to the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people the serious problems caused by constructing large - scale buildings .
To summarise , large - scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to human and animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these problems
First of all , at the English course which I do at the HZ , I learned and improved my writing in many ways .
I would like to answer some questions from the guideline on Moodle , to explain how this course helped me to improve my English .
And the other questions : Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
From my point of view , my writing definitely has improved from the beginning of this school year till now .
Subsequently , I would like to answer the next two questions .
Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
More words can be add in the article , so there can be a better explanation of the subject .
I learned a lot of new words during the presentations , which I used in my free writing .
To finish , I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me , because it has improved my English very well .
The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course , always can be used later on in life .
For example , when there have to be sent letters in English .
This is because all the people dream for a better future .
Among them a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport .
It is already in practice in western world .
Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me .
Private care per individual is needed .
Whether to go to work or other places travelling in private vehicle is hassle free .
It saves lot of our time .
The trend of personal car is increasing rapidly .
We can not deny that there will be time when no person would like to travel by bus or train .
It is so much clear that private transport will overshadow the public vehicles .
Everybody knows about the big problem that our society has , in terms of domestic abuse .
But most of us just from far ; we really do not imagine how this can affect people who suffer it .
Unfortunately , many people are damaged , not only physical but mentally and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves their sons in the hell it causes .
Children quite often feel guilty of can not avoid these troubles or help their mothers to escape from them and tend to think they are doing something wrong when they obviously do not .
It is very serious and hard to solve because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and being able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes .
Even , in most cases , they feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to tell their truth .
All those people who are living this abuse have to know that they are really important and deserve to be happy and free and they are not alone .
There are many people who worry about and are willing to help and support them .
There is always someone who you can count on in your family , friends or associations , but you must ask for help .
There are many reasons for using public transport , such as commuting in to the central business district .
However , the public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues .
Using the car can be more flexible for some individuals .
I think there is a role for both methods of transport after taking in to account all of the above reasons .
The reasons for use is dependent on the individual and the circumstances .
It 's one of the best Al Pacino 's films and it 's very different from previous ones .
First of all , in this film you do n't see a gangster Al Pacino , it 's about a retired army 's coonel who suffers from loneliness and depression .
It 's worth seeing because a young boy , Charlie , helps him get through his sadness in a very luxurious trip to New York .
However , the drama is perfectly achieved in each scene and they keep you tied to the screen .
So , overall I strongly recommend it if you like redemption stories , and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life .
The reading discusses the idea of how advance communication technologies give us an advantages of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons of support .
First point the professor addresses involves the reading 's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and at the same time it will decrease the time frame of getting the project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that based on his own experience this team work could be not so much beneficial .
For instance , some group could have questions , but it would not be able to ask the other group because they would sleep at that time .
Therefore , the working group will do its assumptions and may cause a waste of time .
Moreover , the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do same work differently , so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done .
Another point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause to businesses .
The professor points out that holding virtual meetings between teams in different time frames will be challenging .
Thus , one of the team will have to stay late in order to talk to another group causing inconvenience .
These variables include internal and external cultural expects .
This variables influence the behavior of employees .
The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : individual- , groups- , and organizational performances .
The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employee 's experience .
More and more people nowadays try to find some ways of relaxation , due to a fast pace of life and stress .
Smoking appeals to hearts of many people of different generations , because it gives a fast relief for a short period of time , that is also quite reasonable .
It 's a fact that tobacco is used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities .
Moreover tobacco contains a vitamin , called PP1 that is beneficial for your health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , even though it 's temporarily , it 's still beneficial for your heart , rather than being constantly stressed .
Finally smoking is personal choice of freedom for everyone .
On the other hand , smokers sometimes even do n't realize that their children or relatives become passive smokers too .
So if your habits can be harmful for them you need to understand what 's a cost of it .
For the same reason government needs to control the situation , by using banning strategy if people smoke in one of forbidden ares , like kindergartens , schools , hospitals , etc .
In my opinion , people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own , but as soon as it starts to be a treat for others , they should be stopped immediately .
Madrid is a huge city which offers a lot of recycling facilities that take care of the environment :
There is a great public transport syste .
Old clothes , books and toys in good conditions can be passed on to charity shops .
It could be an example for other cities on how to help and conserve our planet .
Over the past few decades , human activities have changed global climate , hence we are facing higher risks of weather - related disasters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters have struck into the whole society with many negative elements , drawing the attention of citizens toward catastrophes .
Natural disasters such as drought can be generally defined as one that has a far - reaching influence because its long duration and wide scope .
One of the overt reasons for weather - related natural disasters is global warming .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in the demand of cars , industries and farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gases .
With the cause of human activities , the temperature of sea surface and the atmosphere have been gradually growing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century , with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most of greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomenon .
Generally , the increase of temperature has resulted in a surge of hot days , and a drop of cold days .
This will largely causes less of soil water and precipitation .
The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become dryer and insufficient precipitation , which is possible to make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
In brief , there will be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
In the economic aspect , drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .
The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result from the decrease of output .
This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken area is social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the area , such as Africa where is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused an important number of casualties for both mankind as well as animals .
Secondly , farming also has contributed to migration .
When public suffers from natural disasters and they are no solutions , they are forced to leave their home in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might confront a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought has led to severe social impacts of natural disasters .
In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have produced immense economic and social impacts .
Not only human beings but also all the organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
The fact is natural disasters have changed people and animal 's living environment bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
Additionally , climate change relates to natural disasters also causes farming which has triggered death and forced people as well as animals leave their home . More seriously , climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
Perhaps I am being a little wishful thinking .
It is too early is n't ?
It 's to early to talk about love at this day and age .
Everything seems to strange when you fifteen and you are talking about love .
Well , that question has been ringing in my mind for so many months .
To me , falling in love , is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being .
So why bother loving someone who will never return that love back ?
Their life will be happier when you ceased to exist .
Yes , it hurts , but at the end of the day , almost everything in this world , will make you bleed .
It will make you feel vulnerable but that is life .
They will always love you base on your looks then personality .

Some people do not think of walking as a sport , they believe that a sport has to be a rough activity one that left you overtired and sweeting .
But in my opinion a sport is any activity that requires a certain amount of physical activity , one that can help you to improve your health .
I enjoy walking because it allows you to do physical exercise and talk , watch the landscape or do other things at the same time .
If you are young you could walk fast , if you are old or not especially fit , you could start walking at a slow pace and with time improve your performance
I would like to give some advice to the people who want to start walking : Take your time , do not want to walk ten kilometers the first day , try first short walks and every day increase the distance .
You will find yourself walking a little longer and faster than the day before .
And if you do that then , sooner than later , you will become a walking enthusiast
It was a sunny day of April .
Everyone in the house was so excited about it but not Michael .
He knew that soon he will must face his most powerful enemy , the Easter Bunny .
He used to dream him coming in his bedroom , laughing out loud showing off his sharp teeth , threating him with the most horrible punishments .
He was home alone baby - sitting his two year old sister .
All of a sudden he heard somebody knocking at the front door .
He grabbed the phone trying to call his parents .
In a flash his brain sent him a signal and he realized it was only a dream .
He decided it 's time to face his enemy .
He put his hand on the handle and without thinking too much he opened the door .
He did n't have time to get scared because all what he was thinking was why he does n't wake up at once .
I think it is true that colour do influence our decision when we buy different things .
No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well .
For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons .
That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants .
For example , if I liked a thing , I would not think much about its colour or a colour of the shop where I found it .
Moreover , for many people the main factor is a price of a thing but not its colour .
To some up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
My friendship with Jessie started the first exciting day of kindergarten .
We first met at the swings , she smiled and I knew we were going to be friends forever .
I asked her if she wanted a sweet and timidly , she nodded .
When the break was over we went hand in hand to our classroom .
We love doing sleepovers , watch movies and going on holidays together .
It is generally accepted that television is providing us by far the best and easiest way to stay in touch with the whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , taking some time off from our housework .
This is the innovation that such a worldwide media is bringing to our society .
Anyway , I wonder whether it would be useful and able to increase our culture and help us to be more critic towards life rather than impose its power on us .
A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television , not to miss a new cartoon nor a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of .
It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about present topics and problems , in order to learn something more about the world we are living in .
In view of the above arguments , I would suggest anyone to cut out on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
In my opinion there is future for public transport .
Firstly public transport is useful for people that can not afford a car and their work is far away from where they live .
Secondly public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the enviromnent .
Lastly if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops many people will be unemployed , they could not win more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
The countries will have Crisis and this will probably lead to another World War .
That will be a complete disaster because now we have nuclear weapons and we would destroy the world .
In conclusion public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything will be a disaster
Unless you get a job in that year , to keep you busy , or do whatever that keeps you focused and gives you a routine , you should n't take a year off at all .
Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the dealines , the exams , and other stuff that forces you to get things done , and , by consequence , teaches you to be a responsible person , which you would need to be when you get a job , you will simple be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .
One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you never should take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need , due to fatigue or some other physical or pscychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in an usefull way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intelectualy or doing whatever you think that can enrich your life .
I 've wasted so much time in my life that even I found it embarrassing .
I like to beleieve that , like the old Latin proverb says ( and I have already said this ) , there will be glory at the end to the man who endures hardships in his path .
Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits at high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life .
Regardless of what 's waiting for me at the end , I will never give up walking through those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be .
This is some intimate stuff I 'm sharing with you my teacher .
I hope you do n't think that sharing these thoughts with you makes you my new best buddie .
I am writing in reply to your advertisment published in the local newspaper for the vancancy of Junior Chef .
Moreover , I am currently undertaking a Chef Training Course which provides me , not only practical but also theorical knowledge .
Furthermore , I alwyas try to maintain a positive attitude towards my responsibilities and sort out any problem that may occur .
Yours Faithfully ,
I was as happy as a lark but soon it was getting dark .
My leg was injured and it was as painful as a thorn in the paw ; after countless hours of crawling .
Leaning forward slowly , I started crawling slowly like a turtle along the slender hill ; I was on all four !
After a long and tiring crawl , I needed to find a shelter from where I could seek refuge from the chilling wind howling over my head unabated .
Suddenly I saw a small gap between two blocks of snowy hills just enough for me to lie down in .
But before I knew it I was asleep .
Looking down at the watch on my wrist , I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall over the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament .
I continued crawling on all four while wondering , for how much longer , Simon till we meet again .
I never stopped praying all along ; in hope that somehow , somewhere , someone would come along to rescue me .
As I was climbing downhill , I found myself getting blisters on my palm in a manner I could have no control over .
The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on as if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal !
As quickly as I could , I managed to get myself to the nearest leafless tree that I could find where I leaned my back against it to try to gain whatever support I could muster with the little energy that I had left in my body .
Emphatically I reminded myself that I should n't have survived had it not been for God 's help !
With the pain , doubts , hunger all crashing down on me , I was about to give up my fight for ultimate survival .
A second thought crossed my mind telling me that I would miss my family and my best friends !
I had to carry on to fight to stay alive !
Hello Sir / Miss .
My name is Alexandra kennedy .
I 'm 29 , I have a 9 year old daughter .
I was born in Russia , but lived in many different countries around the world .
I have got a family of my own , so I am familiar with looking after children and taking care of them . I enjoy fitness - and can easily help organise children sport activities .
I am also quiet experienced in the kitchen . I am really into healthy nutrition and healthy cooking .
It is important for children to get healthy meals , especially at the age of early teenage years .
I wo n't be afraid of any sort of jobs , I am ready for an adventure !
She is a great woman hardworking , responsible , kind , friendly , intelligent and an amazing person .
She was my firs teacher who was taught me repeat the first word and took my hand to give my first step .
I have fond memories from my childhood , she was always cheering me up when I was in my sad or difficult times , even when she was not feeing well .
Due to the interest in protecting animals , people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) which is an international non - governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation , research and restoration of the environment .
This is clearly seen when driving in the route and suddenly you see a bull or a cow in the middle of the way .
this may cause not only the animal death by being run over but also the passengers ' death if the driver tries to stop and lose the control of the car .
First of all , I would like to say that the young people have worse health nowadays .
It is our fault because we have let the companies to profit from our own sins .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to resist the temptation .
You should take a look at the things your children have at their reach .
Therefore , I call to action .
Kateryna was born in 1988 in Siberia , RF in the family of Ukrainian Tatars .
The art of writing letters along with painting colorful mandalas were taught by her grandmother .
A huge mirror in her bedroom made a child believe that one is able to travel through it anywhere .
She loved watching printer at work producing numerous results of psychology tests , which she had just passed .
She graduated the high - school at the age of 15 .
By this time she had been spending almost all her free time near the computer .
She devoted all her free time to experiments on linking the math homework with programming of the music equalizer .
She graduated Kiev International University in 2009 .
Kateryna was frustrated with classic film genre and started looking for possibilities for realization of experimental theoretical ideas on practice .
After taking part in numerous festivals and concerts she had finally entered a joint British - Russian program for training socio - cultural managers in the cultural sphere .
The sport that I like the most is Dancing .
It may sound weird or even wrong for some people , because there are many of them that do n't even consider dancing as a sport ... but for me , and for everyone that has ever done dancing , it is not only a sport , but a very difficult one .
Dancing requires a lot of things , like cordination , flexibility , and physical condition , just to mention a few .
But despite how hard dancing can be , it is also really fun , and that 's actually what makes me enjoy it the most .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it serious , because even though I said it is fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .
The influence of the grown - ups : great or not so ?
Recently I have listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
This got me thinking , how do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters ?
And is this always a good influence , or should adults interfere less with the behaviour of younger people ?
This can differ from the rules your parents have set for you , to the laws created by the governmen .
Secondly , adults can offer advice to the youngsters .
This might be of great influence on youngster , for adults are seen as the wiser people .
Think of celebrities for example .
They are of great influence on younger people .
So when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters , they can influence behaviour in a positive way .
Especially when they have to live under a great lot of rules .
This is because adults lived in a complete other time , so their advice might be outdated .
Lastly , when a wrong example is set , this can influence behaviour in a negative way , because they 'll try to act to this wrong example .
Today we will make a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about " Frozen shoulder " .
1- Most of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation .
2- If you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition , then that is another myth because frozen shoulder occurs to people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time .
Usually after major operations , having a stroke or bone fracture .
They ignore using full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation .
So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness , movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time .
3- An important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgeries are usually needed .
The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol .
In addition to this , physical therapy is also an important way of treatment to maintain a full range of movement .
Cortisone injections are also helpful , these injections can improve everything ; decrease swelling , stiffness and pain .
You can never have a frozen shoulder if you followed these advices :
- If you had a surgery or an injury , you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful .
- Physiotherapy is not only about exercises , some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering .
The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation how our town takes care of the environment as well as what do people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive .
Nowadays young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity about the pollution cycle .
Besides the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school , they are the most civilized and responsible .
A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education but because of their anxiety to show their kids that they are a great and responsible parents .
Every year we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman 's work every single day .
As far as I am concerned there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you take papers to the floor you will have to pay a fine .
However , everything starts at the level of education that every human being receives .
Unfortunately , there is still a long way to do in terms environment concerns , but some of this solutions suggested by the mayor help us stopping the pollution .
There are some kinds of pollution such as garbage and wasted bottles , but some pollution is invisible such as noise and dirty air .
They have already had great impact on people 's life .
However air pollution affects not only people health but also the whole environmental system .
China is a big industrial country so there are a great number of factories and trucks .
It also makes oxygen lacking but more and more carbon dioxide , the same result as CO2 .
CO2 can destroy the ozone .
If we do n't start to face this problem , we will hurt this planet we live in .
Environmental problems that touch us all .
Not only the government should make laws to control the situation but also we should do our best not to create more pollution .
For Example , if you do n't smoke , you wo n't cause air pollution and you wo n't damage your health ; if you use public transportation , walk more or take bicycle as your transportation , you will not only help reduce the pollution bust also improve your health .
Also , planting more trees instead of cutting them to purify our breathing air and reduce air pollution .
While there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention .
To maintain the only earth we live in is now the major issue for us nowadays .
Was 31st October .
It was dark outside , the weather was windy and the leaves fell from the trees .
When Alison came to she did not see any people .
When it was already 10 pm suddenly a car appeared in the dark .
Finally , she saw the lights of the approaching car and ran toward the car .
Therefore , it would be incredible expensive to reunite all of them again for another film .
At that moment he seemed like the new Steven Spielberg .
Nowadays he has turned into another director .
It has a pair of good tunes and they use them .
The script is made of pure gold .
It is so tightly knitted you do not realise it is telling you the story of a failure .
Dear Prof . Findlay ,
I am excited to apply for the Course Materials Writer position available at your company .
I have a MSc in Food Science and PhD in Biochemistry .
My scientific work was published in seven scientific articles .
Moreover , in a position as a Medical Writer I wrote scientific documents for clients in the pharmaceutical industry .
Furthermore , I was a writer and editor for the project Food Info , a platform to inform the general public about food science related topics .
The advertised position is very appealing for me because I have always been fascinated about nutrition and natural therapies .
I would be very motivated to contribute to the development of excellent education material for the Faculty of Health and Wellness of Think Education .
I am a very dynamic , creative and proactive person and I possess a strong work ethic .
The modern times have raised the concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
The public transportation can help fighting greenhouse gas emissions and can help us protect the world from Climate change effects .
In the recent years there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Now days , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .
In developing countries , there is still a low level of awareness about the side effects of using private polluting cars .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of one 's behavior is becoming important and concerning .
In my opinion it is just a matter of time until all the transportation options will be public and the private cars will be left behind .
People 's life will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
We can know this just by comparing the life now and 50 years ago .
Although now we have very advanced technology which has made our lives completely different and comfortable than before , in the future it will be much better than this .
We will definitely have better drugs and also less incurable diseases .
However , it is possible that along new inventions and research there might be more harmful viruses also .
There are some downsides of an advanced world too , for example , people will be more unhealthy due to the environmental conditions and also less self - reliant because of the technology progress .
Many parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education they wish to give to their children and one of the first decisions they must take is what type of school they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single sex school or a mixed sex one .
It can not escape our minds that at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
While the hyper sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for may parents , sending their children to a mixed sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and in many cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender which , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but the child as a key in the future of the country and , as an extent , to the world .
Therefore and to sum up , Is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mix sex schools , which reflects the society we live in , as opposed to single sex ' which may reinforce those stereotypes that are mining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving engines of the Western economy .
It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say that even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are particularly dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
All things considered we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear in the short term and in no time everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
Currently I am working as a teacher of English in my city of Dnipropetrovsk .
Nowadays it is important to be a role model for your pupils - so I try to keep fit and show modern movies about staying healthy .
I consider myself to be ideally suited for this job for several reasons .
First of all , I have considerable experience in working with teenagers ( for more than 5 years ) which I find really enjoyable .
Second , I am quite energetic , open , active and educated person .
And finally , I am kind of person who is responsible , well - organised and optimistic .
And , of course , to add up an extra actvity to my CV as I am used to do every summer .
Looking forward to your reply .
However , others claim that it is vital for societies and next generations .
According to supporters of it , there are many benefits of genetic engineering .
As it is known , it is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases .
Supporters also claim that , it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine .
The other benefit is about human life .
Genes could be changed before a baby is born thus , inherited illnesses would no longer exist .
In spite of the benefits , there are also certain drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Another problem is the genetically modified food products .
In conclusion , it seems the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Not only did they share a clear interest in writing about social issues that struck the contemporary life in Britain , but they also had similar ways of structuring their novels .
In both novels the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses ( " David Copperfield " ) and Boarding Schools ( " Jane Eyre " ) .
In Dickens ' novels Realism allows the readers to know how tough London society was in that period .
It was a narrow street lined up by two - story buildings on the floor of which shops , pubs were flashing their neon signs .
What he did n't know , or just could n't accept , was he was unwilling to tolerate other people 's views , and jokes that 's why he packed my things and asked me to find another place to stay .
The reason ? I told him I found a job in another city and I was considering moving house .
I explained to him it was the chance of my life given that good jobs for women are difficult to find , pay is n't the same as for men and I felt I did n't receive the status men in my company enjoyed .
I mean it was a joke I made and I had no real intention to leave him .
I must have seem cruel to him because , despite our daily disagreements , he adored me and was serious about settling down soon .
As you know , I helped at a concert of U2 last month and I 'd like to tell you something more about it .
It was , of course , a ones in a lifetime opportunity , one I grabbed with both hands .
When you hear you are asked to help out in a concert of your favourite band , you ca n't refuse .
I must say that not all of them are veru easy to work with .
The things some of them wanted , unbelievable!Luckily , I had some other students helping me find all the curious things for the famous .
Despite all the hard work I had to do , I would not have to think twice if they ask me to do it again .
Not to say that now I have some good connections in the world of the rich and famous !
Due to the ever - increasing population coupled with the climate change , food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries .
Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield .
It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance gene .
This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment .
This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safety .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bring it into markets , have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals .
In views of this , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage .
However , because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed , it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food .
When a student came in , also he was surprised to see so many people inside , but , after a while , he realized what was really happening : dozens of wet raincoats had been left on the chairs by students of another course .
The student did n't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion : he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody .
Students Use of Leisure Time
On 3th March 2014 , a survey was conducted among 60 students .
The purpose of the survey was to discover popular leisure time activities of male and female students .
It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays , while 90% of the female students would like to go to the seaside .
In the second section both the girls and the boys interrogated claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera .
For example , only 10% percent of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least one time a week .
More than a half of the male students spend their spare time doing sport two and more times a week .
Unlike the boys the female respondents usually do n't feel like going in for sport at leisure .
In contrast to the male respondents the girls interrogated go to evening classes in their free time .
Like the male respondents the girls interrogated go regularly to the cinema .
For instance , 47% of the female respondents watch films on a big screen every week .
In the third part of the questionnaire was found out that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home more than 2 hours a day .
In contrast to the girls interrogated who almost never play computer games the majority of the male students gamble for hours at leisure .
The female respondents are more fond of reading books that the male ones .
40% of the girls read books several hours a day , while 13% of the male students do n't read in their free time at all .
The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours by surfing the Internet .
For example , 53% of the female students are on - line more than 3 hours a day .
If any conclusions may be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
There is an evident tendency to the decline in the active ways of spending free time .
The young people of both sexes prefer to be on - line or playing computer games at leisure .
According to the findings , it is clear that nowadays going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places .
There are therefore a clear need for young people to prefer active and educating leisure time activities to passive ones .
Please accept our dearest apologies ; it was the least of our intentions to offend you with our release letter , which is a standard format authorized by our legal department .
Of course you can share your opinions and experiences about your stay wherever and with whoever you wish .
There has never been any intention of hiding the truth as you said .
In addition , we are sorry that your holiday experience was affected by the fire occurred on Saturday October 10th , 2015 .
It was not an easy task to find a new accommodation and relocate over a thousand people .
We do know that the incident might have caused some inconveniences , but the most important thing is that none of our guests or staff was injured .
We are sorry for the time it took to relocate you , the least we could do was to offer you an upgraded room at Paraiso Mar y Beach .
We hope that our explanations and apologies will make you change your mind and that you give us another chance in the future to provide you with a much more delightful experience .
Given the circumstances we would like to offer one of the following compensations if you decide to travel with us again in the future :
In my opinion many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
If you compare the price of petrol with the price of a bus ticket you can clearly see how much better it is to travel by bus .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train , on your journey you can read or just look through the windows .
However , I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedomn , you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way .
Furthermore , you can choose what time you would like to travel and where .
But despite all this there will always be people without a car who needs to commute every day so there is a long future for public transport .
As long as people keep accepting this technology for communication , social media sites will also keep proceeding to the next step and affecting the society .
In terms of the communication society , they will possibly change the way in which people develop relationship with each other , and consequently , they will create two types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , people have ability almost equally , and value interpersonal relationship .
These types of culture will oppositely exist in the future as an effect of social media sites .
There is nothing worse than not be able to communicate with people when you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustrating sensation that you could n't want to go back again .
This article deal with the benefits and drawbacks , if there are any , of learning another language .
On the one hand you 'll feel more active and you 'll realise how your brain memory gets better and better .
Besides , you 'll understand the native people when you 're going on holiday .
This could be a drawback because not all the people are up to the task .
To wrap up the article I 'd strongly recommend that young people to learn at least a new foreign language especially if you 're a student .
Nowadays , famous people like movie stars , politicians , models and other celebrities suffer from lack of privacy .
They are also the reason for many problems , which appear in private lives of some celebrities .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact , that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in one 's private life , when the person does n't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing .
I strongly agree with the statement , that famous people also should have their own private lives , which no one 's following and that no one knows about it .
It is very hard to lead a normal life , when you have to think all day long , about what you say , what you wear and first of all , what you do .
Being a celebrity means working all the time , you have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work .
On the other hand , it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives , but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life .
In my opinion everyone deserves to have a private life even if he is a public person .
I 'm sure that no one would like to see his photo in a newspaper , on which he 's eating or making a stupid face and that 's why we should respect other 's privacy .
Everything that goes on in the famous person 's life , including births , deaths , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If the individual stumbles , whether figuratively or literally , speculation about him will end up on TV , on the Internet or the front page of the tabloids .
They think that due to scandals they will be able to get fame , live in the lap of luxury and have a lot of money .
On the other hand , not everybody prefers to reveal the secrets of the private life .
For these kinds of people it is important not to bring out family scenes and problems , as they do n't want to be disputed in public .
When you clock out at work , no one has the right to make you keep working .
As it seems to me , private information about stars should be published if they approve of it putting the signature .
It would be fairly by celebrities .
I 'm glad to hear that you 've decided to take part in an organisation of this month 's concert .
I hope you find it useful as I did last month .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience I gained during preparations for the last concert .
As a volunteer I was helping make meals for VIP guests .
I know it could be a problem for you since you ca n't cook , but organisers need volunteers in many fields : scenography , sounding , VIP - escort .
Nowadays almost everyone in the world has contact with computers and the great majority of them have been using the Internet .
However , Facebook , as well as many other social networking sites , has its dark side too .
It may lead to inefficiency at school - or workplace - or even sleeping disorders .
Nowadays , anyone can take a photo from the web and assume it 's theirs .
And also , lets not forget that going out with friends from time to time wo n't hurt anyone .
The Soviet Union collapse has become one of the defining events in the world 's history .
It influenced the further development of post - Soviet countries as well geopolitical situation in the whole world .
It has also influenced the international relations not just within post - Soviet area , but also in the entire world , as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked as crash of bipolar structure of international relations .
So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War , fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union , the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass - media but also in the American society .
American press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc .
The tensions in the Soviet Union came to its peak in August 1991 , while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea , a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow .
The"New York Times " made a series of publications dedicated to the coup .
The articles headlined " Soviet crisis " have broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia .
On the August 20 , " New York Times " published the article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .
The American press summing up the era of Gorbachov frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of the Soviet society .
The buried secrets of past regimes and the foibles of the present one were exposed to public scrutiny by a press " - the New York Times wrote .
The plotters have immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin .
Tens of thousands hit the streets in Russia in order to defend the democracy .
Decisive actions of Yeltsin have been supported by most world governments and international communities .
Boris Yeltsin has gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup 's leaders .
The coup , due to lack of organization and support by the military forces , failed three days after .
The person of Boris Yeltsin has become the most popular one in that time world 's press .
Leading articles of the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president .
American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status for his defiant stand , also mentioning that the people had knew a little about him .
The article of the New York Post " THE SOVIET CRISIS ; Yeltsin 's Remarks : A ' Reactionary Coup " refers to the night of 18 - 19 August 1991 when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power .
The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which have acquired broad and irreversible character .
Also it shows the disposition of the soviet people towards the changes in the country . "
This coup had a big resonance among the American society ; consequently the US mass - media were eager to know the feelings of the US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union .
The US citizen deemed the crisis as a menace for the liberalisation of society ; they assumed it as an actual barrier for the expression of people 's will . "
The press accentuated that many of Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War were harshly reminding that this is still the nuclear age .
The dissolution of the Communist party has also become one of most popular issues among American mass - media .
The reduction of Gorbachov 's role and the growth of the Yeltsin 's haven't been out of the attention in the US media sources .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics . "
The Communist Party , which has had control for 74 years , is rapidly dissolving - the Chicago Tribune wrote .
The US mass - media followed the reaction on the crisis inside Communist party closely One of the articles of the Washington post " Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe 's Communists " tells that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe .
The dissolution of the Communist party was concerned as the one of the features of the Soviet Union collapse .
In the Washington Post the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup has finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people .
The upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of the new states and following referendums on their independence .
The official collapse of the Soviet Union has occurred in December 1991 .
On the 25th of December 1991 Gorbachov has officially resigned .
The Washington Post has written down : " a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991 .
Soviet époque , which had existed for 74 years , came to its end and this paved the way for establishment of new independent republics .
" What young people are interested in ? "
As requested I interviewed a large number of young people , trying to understand their main interests , especially as regards music , TV programmes and clothes .
Many people aged between fourteen and eighteen said that the most listened music among teenagers is definitely rock music .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical music and love the Opera .
The people I interviewed are very keen on reality shows like " Big Brother " and similar but I have to say that many of them are also interested in cooking shows and documentaries .
Finally , regarding to the clothes , young people declared to prefer casual outfits like jeans , t - shirts etc .
In the whole , I think that young people have now a large variety of interests .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable idea ?
What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be ?
Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiating within the business market .
However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible .
While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
Such a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities .
After all , a couple of professions might become extinct , for example translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost .
The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership .
However , this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses .
On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance the aboriginal people .
Anyway , , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggestion and other languages like Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as well .
Is it really that the end of public transport is soon to come ?
I hold an opposite view ; my answer is " no " , for sure .
Yes , they are right in saying so and in fact , many people are second - hand car owners .
But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair , and , of course , buying petroleum .
The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those avoidable extra cost .
Under this circumstance , some people may rather take public transport to save money for their " dream house " rather than buying a car .
It is clearly seen that there is still much room for survival for public transport .
Secondly , even people have cars , they may also take public transport .
As we all know , Hong Kong is famous for scarcity of land , there are not many parking spaces available , so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company are hence may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees of using the parking lot .
Greenhouse gases have already posed grave threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , which raised people 's environmental awareness .
Hence , contrary to many people perceive , there should be an increasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , for public transport .
From the reasons mentioned above , it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line .
But how about the future further far away ?
Like our ancestors would have never imagined that we can now fly in the sky by plane .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that drops us a bombshell , so rapid that we can never predict how far it can go .
Maybe one day we need no cars , or public transport .
Simply by thinking of a specific location , we can go there in a split second .
There 's not much work you have to do on a normal day , but maybe this will be a special one , because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away .
Once you close it , it would be great if you could let the keys in David 's house , which is in the same building .
There is about 14 workers in the shop , divided in 2 groups with different schedule each one .
They have similar skills and productivity , but , honestly , I prefer working with the morning one . I do n't think you 'll have any problem with both groups .
If there is any problem with the cash registrer ( very common , actually ) , you have a phone number under it of a good technician .
The bill will be assumed by us .
Write back soon and let me know if you have any concern .
However , it is one of the most motivating challenge in our lives .
They are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences .
For example , a close relationship or a serious illness make us look at the world around us through different eyes , and also they let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings .
Even so , change can be perceived as a disturbing question due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Furthermore , we sometimes feel scared to face new experience and then we can lose a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality to become better people in any aspect of our lives because it represents a major challenge .
It is true that sometimes it is hard to accept certain changes but we can always learn something useful from them .
Are you ok ?
You said that your flight lands at 10.30 am so it 's better if you go to the train station near the airport .
When you get out of the airport you have to turn right and walk for ten minutes and then the station is right in front of you , it 's quite simple my friend ! I 've just looked the timetable and your train arrives at 11.04 am .
It 's about 6 euro .
So , do n't worry and take t - shirts and shorts !
Nowadays , there 's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and saving mathematical equations .
Classes are being held much more interactive than in the previous years , and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life .
In the following essay I want to discuss the most useful skills which should be taught in school from an early age on .
In order to prevent the younger generation of our society of consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes .
Not only is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to create healthy meals , but also does it strengthen relationships among classmates , as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes .
However , there 's still a more important area to have a good knowledge about - personal finance .
Teachers can take up the role of the parents and giving them a knowledge about finances and the right way to handle it .
To conclude , there are a lot of things worth considering to teach in school .
Both of them are skills which help managing your life later on , finances in particular .
Jake is a free lance .
He uses to travel from place to place following the most burning news around the world .
As a free lance , he has to invest in his ideas , hoping that someone will like his stories and buy them .
To fly in different continents is nowadays easy but still expensive .
A few months ago month he had been spending two weeks in Brussels .
He was following an important European summint on environmental issues .
Access to sevreal public transport services ( such as underground , buses , tram , etc . )
let him reach his working meeting always on time .
He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels ' suburb .
During winter Brussels might be quite cold .
However , metros and buses are equipped with such a powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold .
He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome .
It was spring , the prefect time to go and visit South of Italy .
Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought .
Jake 's main challenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes .
Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars .
Towns are congested by traffic jam , especially during rush hours .
Such experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people 's life and their surrouding .
Stress - it makes your life easier since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jam
Communications - it eases movements from place to place
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car ; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community , in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel !
Although , I have been struck by its major draws such as Plaza De Espana , Real Alcazar and El Torre del Oro , this is the relaxed and social way of living which has most impressed me .
Therefore , it all comes down in this writing to expressing feelings about Seville and its surrounding .
I must well admit this has not always been so .
Consequently , what are the reasons of my change of heart ?
The more I understand it the more I like it .
Luckily , this has not been the case so when it comes to Seville .
What 's more , Seville is bright , colourful and lively which cheers me up and relaxes me .
To make matters even better , there was some music played a few meters ahead , which contributed to liven up the spirit of everyone present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " draft beer " and going for a " tapas crawl " with friends as in Switzerland each one gets its own dish when eating out and only go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost on the winding narrow cobbled streets as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures .
Some of these are striking secluded places such churches or Moorish - styled houses .
Thus , scouring Seville is like rewinding the time and being propelled in the past .
It turns out to be now a very welcoming and relaxing place where warm - hearted people live and where I greatly enjoy spending some time .
This year , in Italy , for the first time in more than 200 years , it happened a weird coincidence : the political leader Silvio Berlusconi and the singer Ligabue marked their careers on the same day .
On the one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when some journalists told the world some wiretappings of his which would compromise his future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue won the award for the best song of the year , bringing his career ever forward .
If I had also a year free , I would only prefer travelling not working .
If you decide to ground in Geneva , I suggest you to visit first the north of Switzerland from the west to the east and then the south of Switzerland from the east to the west .
Switzerland is a small country also take your time and spend enough time in each place .
Concerning your inquiry on working in my country , it 's really difficult to get an authorisation to work , especially for periods longer than a week .
Therefore , I suggest you to work during your travelling time .
For instance if you plan to stay more than one week in Zermat in Wallis , think to try to find a place where you could help in a restaurant or a shop .
But if you prefer to work during a full three - month period , you should ask your employer a work permit .
She said that she would go out in five minutes .
Five more minutes went by , and he decided to get into the bungalow .
They both know what would happen if Tris 's husband found out a stranger in his house .
- I must find her before he does it .
First of all , the public transport is obsolete .
Finally you can choose who would travel with you .
It could seem to point towards public transport , nevertheless it will push car travelling even further .
In summary , the public transport is dying .
This TV serial is mainly based on working class people and represents various ethnic minority communities including African and Asian Muslims .
This show is particularly good as it represents how people from different ethnic backgrounds can engage with each other .
Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters , it also shows the importance of family values . I would definitely recommend this drama serial to other people .
It is important to gain awareness about different societies due to the fact that Britain is becoming such a multicultural society .
Second , people on the boats are granted the opportunity to see beautiful ocean lives , while taking a plane does n't provide this luxury to take a look at the birds in the sky for planes are travelling at such a high speed .
I am writing to complain about the suggested bar on smoking in public areas .
I am very concerned about this proposal , for a number of reasons .
To support my argument against this proposal I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town .
In the first place , few people did know about this law , and , of course , most business opposed the idea .
If this happened in café Noir , probably I could lose my job .
In my opinion , introducing specific non - smoking areas in this type of establishments could be an excellent idea .
It 's not easy for me to talk about myself , but I 'll give my best .
I 've been living in Augsburg for nearly two years now and am studying B.A. Anglistik and economics .
Before moving to Augsburg , I studied biology for two semesters in Erlangen , but soon noticed that it was n't the right subject of study for me .
Biology is still a hobby of mine , but I 've always been good with languages and so I 'm doing now something I 'm naturally good at .
I can speak English and of course German - and because my grandparents are from Korea , a little Korean , too .
The good thing is : the rest of the time living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets .
Also I visited the USA multiple times : I travelled the west coast from San Diego to San Francisco , I 've been to Las Vegas , Chicago and Boston .
I am a 23-year - old student in a Sports Science degree , so I am interested in sports .
Besides , I am open - minded , easy going and friendly .
I have experience in children Summer camps and recently I attended a First Aid course , so I could deal with a difficult situation .
Furthermore , I speak a little French .
I have no problem in being hired for three months because I do not go to the university in Summer .
It demands physical effort , being and excellent way to keep fit .
Starting with the social skills , it is obvious that a football match is a dispute , a game we involve in with the intention to win .
This kind of action , when peformed collectively , requires coordenation of efforts and abitity to work together , two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world .
If you play footbal , you know how to act when in a team .
Moreover , footbal is a physical game .
Unlike chess or bridge , football makes you leap , run , kick .
In times of escalators and cars , it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement , velocity and strenght .
In fact , it can be argued that the human virtues are a by - product of conflicts and fights ; that they are that traces of character that we aknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition , be it for a trophy or for a country .
It is a sport that develops no only the body , but also the mind and the heart .
In a club you will find professional advice and also as many peopole as it is necessary for a match .
In fact , if football has a downside , it is this , the fact that you need twenty - two people to set a match .
But , provided that , you will have one of the best ninety minutes of your entire life .

To further improve my Chinese , I enrolled for the Post - Intermediate Mandarin class during my undergraduate study , in which I achieved a First - Class result .
Beyond my academic disciplines , I have consistently taken up some active roles at university and outside school to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills .
I was trained as a PASS ( Peer Assisted Study Session ) leader for econometrics to provide some academic support to some younger students at my final year of study at Manchester .
I attended trainings and workshops to learn about the skills to be a good facilitator before the start of the academic year .
The regular meetings with my group of students to discuss their questions on econometrics have developed my empathy which is a crucial skill of being a leader .
Besides , I have undertaken an internship at the HSBC Risk in order to gain an insight into the banking industry and learn how to work with my peers in a business environment .
In the next following days , we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals .
During these 10 days , we walked a lot instead of catching a bus , because it saved money too .
This is kind of the real vacation for me .
Even though I was in a romantic city , I could n't enjoy my vacation in a romantic way due to the low budgets we had .
To me , a dream vacation is like going to a beautiful island like Palau , where I can enjoy the sunshine and the sea .
When I am there , I would start my day by calling room service for a wonderful breakfast in bed .
As the day goes on , I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea , go snorkeling or just lie on the beach .
This is the kind of dream vacation I want so bad .
There are always the differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation .
Once I have enough money , I will have my dream vacations come true .
When I finished the high school , I started working as accountant in my father 's carpentry .
He produces doors and windows on wood .
At the beginning it was really difficult to me because I was a little shy with customers and I was n't used to working among noisy machinery and shouting workers , but after a while time I learned to ignore all of that !
I was working in a very small country and my office was isolated , so I did n't have any contact with other people and my job started to get boring .
My father was happy because it was a great opportunity and understood that it was what I 've been dreaming for a long time .
Five years have passed and I 'm still working for this company which has given me a lot and I 've been learning many things about accounting .
In fact I am administrative manager and I feel really proud of myself .
Last but not least I 'm a great fashion expert because I work near the shopping streets !
Dear sir / madam ,
I would like to apply for the job which includes working in summer camps all over the USA .
My name is Aly Meeuws , I am 16 years old , I live in The Netherlands at the moment and I am really planning on going to the USA in the future , so this would difinitely be a great experience for me especially for my English and being away from home .
Until next summer I will still be in school but hopefully I will graduate so I can go to college afterwards .
Often after school I babysit my parents friends ' children and I usually really like it ! I am also a very athletic person so I would not mind entertaining the children for a longer period of time and also doing some physical exercises .
Besides that , I also really enjoy cooking with my mom at home so working in the kichens would not be a problem at all .
Once I cooked a Christmas dinner for me and my whole family and surprisingly everyone enjoyed it which definitely came as a surprised to me !
There has never been a bigger force for change than technology , it changes absolutely everything about the way we live , even the way we talk with each other .
Social Media such as Twitter , Facebook , Youtube and blogs illustrate surely that the definition or repercussion of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are worn and the social relations and associations that expand around them .
This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life , emphasizing the problems which arose with the use of Facebook and Twitter .
Finally it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technoogy .
Social networks websites can be explained as a web usefulness that admit people to create a public or semi - public profile , arrange a list of other contacts which is possible to share connection and look and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include ( 1 ) creaction of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes " .
Another rapidly expanding social networking is Twitter .
These kinds of websites allows people to interact with others precisely by smartphones or computers .
By Twitter , users post opinions or comments narrow to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebook people can share pictures , vídeos and thoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not especially for socialising but also for academic purposes , like to obtain benefit for their studies or to recover time in discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some departments of police in the USA used Facebook to share a vídeo of a felony with the expectancy to identify the suspects and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in return to the publication .
Additionally , a politician from Philadelphia , USA was elected after take advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign .
My ex - husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment .
During our dating he was very charming and attentive .
We discussed about some sexist ideas that I do n't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him , but I was fine with that because That can happen , but due to my profession he could n't be like that for so long because I was in a man 's shoes .
He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed .
I learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman , he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out , while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house .
I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments .
I also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day .
For example , while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day , while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours , just whith a blank mind .
But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women should n't know anything about .
I also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man 's mind , and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to help and be an honor man or not , he is going to be a good and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs .
Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes .
They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink if those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone .
Once upon a time there was a majestuous kingdom in England , surrounded by beautiful rivers , waterfalls and mountains .
Princess Sophie grew up , she was so unhappy because she could n't do anything , she was condemned to live in a room of the castle until someone could find the cure for her cursed .
One day she figured out how to escape through a hidden passage , she got to the town and ran and jump , she did every little thing she was n't aloud to since so long .
While she was having some fun , a handsome boy crashed her and she fall to the ground .
- I am so sorry Madam , excuse me for my blunder .
I am Michael .
The princess was a little scared of talking to someone she did n't know , because she never got to talk to anyone before , but still she answer him with a big smile - You are excused , my name is Sophie.- It truly was love at first sight .
Michael asked her to go with him for an ice cream so he could amend his fault .
Sophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that through the time became in more than just a friendship , they fall in love for each other .
Princess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael , until one day , when she was just about to meet Michael to confess him all the truth about who she really was , a guards discovered her and the King commanded to lock her up in her room .
Princess Sophie send him a lot of letters telling him the truth about her , and about her cursed .
Michael decided to leave the kingdom , when he was just about to close the door he turned back to his coffee table and saw the letters , he had a hunch but he ignored it .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he has made a mistake .
What happens in future will be decided by what happens now .
People are advised to carpool and travel to work places .
Several announcements over radio and TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save nature .
People may choose to ignore the advice now but in future they may not have a choice .
One of the latest film I have seen is Silver Linings Playbook , played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence .
It 's a comedy with romantic features and at the same time very realistic .
They meet by chance and started a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find the way to help each other and not surprisingly finally they fall in love .
I personally think that the film transmit an interesting view of the psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problems .
I strongly recommend you to go and see the film .
They enjoy both local bands ' production and some foreign songs .
Except classics like Friends , popular shows include How I Met Your Mother , The Big Bang and the new HBO talk show Last Week Tonight . I can say with high certainty that reality TV is no more in with young people in my country .
Most teens tend to create their unique style , often managing to start a fashion of their own .
This information can help the organizers of next year 's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes .
My friend Peter recently told me that he was moving out from his flat , so I asked him if he was willing to rent it .
Furthermore you will increase the course fee by 15% from next month .
In the future , you do not provide the Japanese course at convenient time .
I am very sorry but I can not accept this !
It 's about the story of a little boy that is haunted by a big secret , he is visited by ghosts .
The boy soon becomes friends with the psychologist , and he started noticing plenty of things about this exceptional boy .
I found this movie both exciting and emocional , both thumbs up for me !
As the secretary of the English Language club i am writing to propose that our club be given funding for the coming year .
Outline of the club activity
We regulary organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film .
For example , with every film seen our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions , particularly as we always have discussions aroud a subject related to the film .
Also our monthly speakers are exellent , for example , last year we invited a well - known actrice , Janet Hewitt , to share some of her experience on Broadway .
Unfortunalety , organising this kind of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough .
We also believe the college benefits from our Club .
Being founded in 1920 by our well - known alimni , John Carter , the English Language Club is the oldest club in our college .
The fact that everyone from the community cand participate at our events is helping us to develop a positive relation between the college and the community .
We hope you will be ablte to take all thisinto account and will find it possible to help us continue and improve our club by funding us .
Especially , when it comes to go shopping .
Shopping centres are located in the city centres , so every road trip lasts ages ( I live in a suburb ) . Thusly , when I get to the mall , I am already bent out of shape .
Afterwards the crowd of people is ramming me , when I 'm trying to walk .
The lightning in shops is obnoxious .
I 'm not able to find any nice gears .
At the end I 'm livid and exhausted .
The way Easter and specifically Good Friday is celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content .
People do n't want to to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of Easter celebration , so to Easter Sunday .
Suffering as well as death is pushed away from our real life - we do n't want to experience them but rather watch it on different kinds of TV shows .
3 . L'Oreal slogan " Because you 're worth it " proves the author 's thinking that we are unwilling to sacrifice ourselves .
In a consumptive lifestyle we want more and more for ourselves , but not for other people , because it will require self - sacrifice .
It was a hot summer day , everyone was walking to their usual destination ; work , school , buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes at the cleanners , everyone except Peter .
He was sweating , looking at people in a confusing way .
Suddenly , Peter started to run , while he ran , he looked at his watch , over and over again as if by looking at his watch time would stop .
But this was not the case , time continued to pass by , ever so slowly , making Peter even more nervous .
He stopped at a great big building knowing that the fastest way to get to the top floor of the building was by taking the elevator , but what if the elevator stopped ?
He decided to take the stairs and so he did .
Peter smiled for a brief moment as he remembered his obsession with Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity , he thought " finally I understand it " .
It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day , but while they are doing this they are sitting in a comfortable sofa .
I feel very strongly that computer games could be an enjoyable way to do physical exercise without going out of home .
In the market , you can find a wide range of computer games or video games to keep fit , such as dancing to the rhythm of last hits , playing tennis , doing aerobics , running ...
It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports like football or basketball .
Although some schools offer the chance of doing these , many others do not do .
To sum up , it is important motivating the young people to do physical exercise .
It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because in this way , they do their favourite sport in a routine way .
It all started with jumping over the big black trashcans .
Back in the time , when I successfully passed the third grade , my parents decided to let me pick the present that I want as a reward .
The very first thing came to my mind was a pair of inline roller skates ; I used to look out of my window , or sitting on my house 's door step and see my neighbors skating and trying to do some tricks and jumps , and all I wanted was joining them instead of watching them enjoying their times .
I ran to the outdoor toys section and I picked the skate I liked .
I tried couple of sizes to see which one fits more .
I could not be more excited to join my friends .
By the time , I got better , and I started to learn how to do tricks and jump over small items .
While skating was a whim for my friends and me in the beginning , I found myself in it .
I knew that skating is the thing I want to do for the rest of my life , the thing I want to tell people about when they ask me what your favorite thing to do is .
In a couple of years , I became much better and I learned to do many tricks like skating backwards , the Snake and the Zigzag .
I learned how to jump over many items , such as chairs and the trashcans that my neighbors used to jump over .
I kept trying to know more about skating .
I entered middle school ; I met two friends who also love to skate , Mohammed and Khalid .
We decided to go skating on the next weekend at the park , which has a wide walk path by the sea .
When we met on the weekend , I noticed that they were different ; they have different skates , and different methods of skating , they slid on edges and skated on the park benches .
I realized that this is what I am looking for , a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates , but this time it is aggressive skates .
Once on a weekend , it was my last year in middle school , I was at the park practicing as usual .
I introduced myself , and as I thought , they were vising from a different city .
The more we get deep into the conversation , the more I want to learn this type of skating .
They showed me what slalom skating is .
They started to put small cones in one line with a bit of space in between .
They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm . I was surprised , I had mixed feeling , and it was indescribable .
I kept staring at them with wide opened mouth and eyes .
I knew at that moment that I want to change my style of skating .
However , as the skaters suggested , I bought a pair of hockey skates .
I did not have the ability to order the cones online back then , therefore , I went to IKEA , and bought small colored cups and used it as cones .
After couple of hours of trying to get used to my new skates , I put the cups on .
After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks , to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing , and to try to reach the perfection , I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport .
Unlike weather in my country , Philadelphia is always rainy , wet , and sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle , it was impossible to skate in this condition .
However , I was not going to give up on skating that easy .
A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot , and for me , everything worth trying just to be able to skate again .
What I learned in 10 years , I had the ability to learn it on ice in one month .
Today , After 10 years of skating , I wonder sometimes what my life would be without skating . I believe that skating is a huge part of me , Mohammed , and I am positive that if this part was missing , my path in life would have changed and I will never be the same person I am now .
Singapore could be the place that you would find everything you are looking for .
This place is a hub where east and west meet , it has been one of the biggest and busiest port in the world .
If you are looking for any luxury brands and extravaganza shopping experience , this is the right place .
Vivo city in Harbourfront and shopping street on Orchard road are good she you want to buy anything from mid - range to the high - end goods .
Both places are extremely crowded with people on the weekend , unless you enjoy people watching , early bird shopping is highly recommended .
Haji lane in Bugis has lots of local boutiques , you can find unique pieces from designers from Asia .
Graffiti on the wall and small lane ways create a punky ambient .
Lastly there are sports dedicated malls , which are velocity in Novena , Kallang mall and Queensway mall .
I 'm , usually , not good at talking or any social things .
I love to listen him talking - I love his voice .
I ca n't suffer even a second 's moment of our awkward silences .
I 'm kind of person who used to think that every hour had a purpose , who had no time to waste , not even a single hour .
I was always having things to do .
He is the most important to me .
Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation consumer 's behavior in a commercial aspect .
But at the same time advertising has many features in common with art .
Like art it is intended to evoke emotions and feelings .
To be successful advertising often uses images from popular movies , catchy melodies , unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings .
Often people , who are watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before .
Secondly , art as well as advertising is such a large part of our everyday lives .
Someone designed all things around : a chair , shoes , clothes .
Visual advertising like painting uses color , value , space and line .
There are elements of art .
Also it uses balance , contrast , emphasis and proportion .
There are principles of design .
Lastly , advertising like art originated a long time ago .
With the development of mass media , television and Internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication .
Now advertising is a big part of modern culture .
Advertising has similarities with the art and often combines other types of art to be more successful .
Modern technologies , the development of mass media are allowed advertising to become the greatest art from the 20th century .
Michael got out of bed on the wrong side that day or , at least , that 's what he thought when , on his way to work , he was so concentrated looking down at his mobile phone that he did n't see a woman approaching him and they both collided .
On her left hand there was a large steaming cup of coffee that landed on Michael 's new shirt when he bumpped into her .
One second later , Michael was covered in coffee , burnt and sticky and his mobile phone screen was twinking until it finally turned off with a dying flash .
He screamed , shouted , waved his hands into the air , swore and insulted that stranger until his rage faded away .
In this article a teacher refltcts on his experiences of creating plays and using them to help motivate students to develop their English .
It consists of eight part : Introduction ; How to start ; Writing the play ; I want to be Cinderella ; Practise ; The big night ; Reason for doing a play and A few final thoughts .
The author says that the pros far outweigh the cons and it is the main idea of the article .
Writing the play : first , you may ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters ; second , learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story .
They you should take a decision of choosing roles : start by asking for volunteers ; and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do .
The most effecnive way is to practise every lesson for ten minutes at the beginning and end .
Some learners will not want a spiaking part , you can even ask them to be promters .
Reasons for doing a play : learners will learn whole chunks of language in a clear context and they will learn not only their parts .
It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate different their skills at the language classroom .
Also they can see how much language they can produse .
In a world of increasing environmental awareness improved public transport represents the way of the future .
Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles , in my opinion they may choose public transport if it fulfils certain conditions .
For example , if people know that by using bus and subway , they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year , many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way .
Regarding my academic experience , I am currently completing my degreee in Primary Teaching and Psycology at the University of Valencia , Spain , where my current speciality is in misbehavioral children .
So far , I have recieved excellent grades in all sabjuects , and I am on course to graduate with distinction at the end of the semester .
Encoled you will find photocopies of all relevant certificates .
I believe my greatest strengths lie in my ability to work well and an aptitude for taking on whatever challenges that come my way .
My future career in teaching would be greatly enhance by earning a degree at your university .
Furthermore , it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of a car because cycling does n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicycle , you first need to check if your bike follows the security instructions .
You also need to know some basic rules such as putting out your arm to indicate when you turn and of course , you need to know the highway code .
Indeed , some places still need to improve the structures for bikes : sometimes they do n't have a lot of bicycle paths .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the circulation while remaining polite with the others , there is no reason to be afraid .
How are things ? I get your message last week .
First of all , I met many people from all over the world . I keep in touch with them all the time .
during the concert I was responsible for checking tickets .
I was working with two people and we were to check two thousand tickets !
We were cleaning over 8 hours !
It was fantastic to take a part in that enterprise .
She swiftly came beside my bed and gave me a letter .
It was from the most dangerous and terrifyng gang of the village .
I met those boys next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the test initiation .
I went into the tiny shop and the shop keeper looked through me .
The shop keeper nodded and pointed at a grey fridge at the end of the shop .
" Thank you " , I mumbled and went straight to the fridge .
My hands were sweating and the other boys were waiting outside ecstatic .
A second later a child entered the shop and began to move around quickly .
I thought it was the perfect moment and at the speed of light I put a whole box of sweets into my old bag .
I walked forwards and stared at the shop keeper .
I was going to leave when the bitter and loud voice of the man surprised me .
" I do n't know " , he answered confused .
" Dear me ! How can you be so cheeky ? " he uttered dismissively taping his feet .
The boy began to mourn .
After watching this , I returned to my house hoping the man forgives the child .
That was the first crime I comited and here I am now , in jail .
This text lead us into the ( for me unknown ) world of horse racing .
In a few sentences we can get an idea of what it is .
And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of events .
If you like animals you 'll ejoy seeing that beautiful horses running and vaulting as fast as they can .
If you like to bet and you 're not used to doing at horse races , maybe you 're looking forward to trying to bet on the nose or each way .
And if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot , you may run into the Queen and greet her , and at the same time enjoy the fabulous view of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear .
Meanwhile you can have a good time drinking some bubbly .
And of course , if you 're not an it - girl , you can spend a lot of money and choose a wrong dress to attend Ascot and perhaps you 'll have to view the races from behind a curtain .
Anyway , if you knew beforehand your odds of winning it would n't be so thrilling .
And if you want to admire the wonderful world of hats , you 'd better buy some magazine where you 'll find all the photos for just 2 €
thanks for the letter which has just arrived . I 've read that you 're writing a term paper on the chances of developing counties to profit from the electronic revolution , are you ?
Because two days ago I 've read an article , by Nadine Bös , about this topic .
The text was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries .
At first you have to know that the technical term for this is " mobile banking " .
Today it is fact that there is a target group for mobile banking : people who are living in remote areas of the world .
On the one hand there are hardly any banks in these regions , so they do n't have access to bank services .
But on the other hand the number of mobile phones has risen .
So now the most important factor is that mobile nets are reaching the remotest areas in the world .
Through this many people would have access to mobile banking and in addition to that it makes money available so it can be used in shops .
According to Hannah Dideck the largest potential is that migrants con use mobile banking to send money home .
I hope I could help you with this information .
This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they do not longer need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
However , the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion : being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people , as you are always available for everyone .
Therefore you do n't have any time to relax , which is essential , even from your leisure duties .
The same is valid for business life : if employees are available all the time , they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home which means a lot of stress .
However , I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsably , according to one 's personal needs .
Before the trip started , the company who decided to make this trip said that everything was perfectly calculated so that it was imposible to have any kind of problem with the spacecraft .
The first 30 years all was going good , but suddenly something bad happened .
One of the cabins broke down and the person who was inside it waked up .
These guy was called Mark and he was engineer .
Once he realized that he was the only person awake he knew something was wrong ..
The first 2 years all was perfect until the day number 734 .
Since then , they never spoke again .
It was such a hot summer that it was impossible to turn off the ventilator and I was a bored child with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network Tuenti and I liked passing all the time chatting .
She picked me up to her house .
Louis was convinced that this new project will be an incredible opportunity for him to try new things and study different fields , which he enjoyed , he loved to read about science , inventions , and stay up to date with the news .
But he immediately thought - why not continue doing what I love while I do something new?-
That 's exactly what he began doing .
He send an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situation and sudden interest in this project .
The company immediately replied telling him that they were sorry if they did n't reply days earlier , but they could n't since the system crashed and did n't allow them to send electronic mail , just to receive .
They told that it was alright if he was interested in other projects , but he still needed to give the same working performance .
They asked him about this project and what was his idea .
He did trust the company , but not that much for them to know everything he thought .
The company told Louis that they did n't want to bother him , but that they were interested in investing in this kind of projects , because it was related to the purpose of the company : exploring .
But Louis knew that the invention needed to have a great design that implemented portability , that is why he needed to refine his ideas for this project to be used in an immense type of useful ways .
The company told Louis that they wanted to compromise in this project and help Louis .
Later , that same day , Louis went cave diving in the mainland .
He wanted to conquest as much territory down the sea level as he could .
He loved the idea to descend to the bottom of the sea where his ideas would n't be taken away or heard .
When he was exploring the bottom of the sea he tried to grab a rock , but just when he touched it scattered into dust , which vanished in the bulk quantity of water around him , that 's when he knew the next important thing that the invention needed to have : resistance .
Although it also needed to be flexible it needed to be tough .
If not , the consumers of this product will end buried .
What happens to the rubbish
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some cases they are completely neglected .
However , people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedient .
The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city .
Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed in small distances since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground .
Not also does it give job to people , but also has a good impact on the town 's scenery .
Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option to transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing of pollution .
Firstly , a car could carry only 5 people at a time .
A bus or an underground wagon can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time .
The less we use cars , the less traffic we shall see in the roads .
Secondly , having a car implies different costs to be afforded .
If a person constantly uses his / her car , he / she shall need to pay for more petrol .
Equally important , a car requires maintenance and it shall be another expense that the owner has to cover .
Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution shall considerably increase affecting air conditions .
I had to stand because we were shifting our house and had just sold almost all of our furniture on OLX .
My mother said that it would be rude to go at that time .
When I opened my eyes I saw a beautiful chair with orange and green stripes .
Suddenly the chair jerked up and went straight out of the window while I was still sitting on it .
It swerved beautifully avoiding a tree and landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
Taking a year off might help people who are uncertain about what to do next to make up their minds , while trying new things and making new experiences that will be useful later on their lives .
It would certainly be counterproductive and a waste of time if the time would be spent doing nothing and just passing the time like it were a long vacation , but if it is used to make new experiences , a year off can change the future of a person .
It can be a great opportunity to travel , meet new cultures and people , or it can be a chance to work to save up money for being able to afford the cost of the university planned on attending .
Or maybe during the year off somebody could also decide that they do n't want to continue their studies , because they already found what they want to do or be .
Sale promotion , which is the set of marketing activities undertaken to boost sales of the product or service , has become a vital tool for marketing and its importance has been increasing significantly over the years .
In spite of some controversies , sales promotion has already demonstrated a mass of positive impact on both sellers and buyers .
The aim of this presentation will be to analyse the aims and approaches of sales promotion as well as to evaluate both benefits and drawbacks sales promotions provide .
Then the presentation will focus on a specific case study------the utilization of Flybuys loyal reward program .
I am writing in order to apply for the position of a volunteer in a summer camp in the USA as written in the advertisement .
I am currently taking exams for my English degree in the Ukraine National University .
Also I am able to work with children as I used to be a tutor in the sport summer camp .

In my free time I like to meet with my friends , go skiing , listening to some music and watching films and series .
This summer I would like to come to one of your camps around the USA .
I 'm a very extroverted guy , with experience taking care of children as I 've been working as a skiing trainer for 2 years now , this winter it will be the third .

All of this abilities make me think I 'm the perfect man for your job .
With any new course , there are some certain expectations one will have .
At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
Before taking part in this course , my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured , durable and financial reliable .
My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks .
By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products .
It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product .
This is because despite having experience in industrial design , I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage .
Therefore , my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members .
However , this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week , whose English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process .
To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill .

In today 's world , due to the fact the great comfort of cars , public transport is likely to disappear .
Firstly , is it true that cars are the faster way of transport .
In addition the car is one of the means most used not only its quickness but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
From my point of view , many people use cars owe to the awful quality of some buses , trains …
We should also consider the fact that nowadays life is so busy that we ca n't waste our time taking public transport .
However , cars can cause some problems like traffic jams and accidents that could be avoided using public transport .
To conclude , it seems to me that it is fine to use cars sometimes but whether the quality of public transport was better , the amount of pollution and accidents would decrease .
In recent years , many regions of the world have faced an issue about water scarcity that may affect their development , especially for those countries undergoing poverty .
This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses including the recycling water , the development of technology about purifying ocean water and multinational sharing about water resources .
Recycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem .
This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people 's daily life , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
However , the use of recycled water for daily routine is less common , because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains .
For example , those recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden , but if they are clear enough , residents only need to heat them to wash dishes or even drink .
Thus , states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level .
Moreover , developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
As is well known , about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need .
Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect dwellers ' physical health and promote their living standard .
In this way , those states of drought regions will obtain enough time and technical aid to overcome water problems .
Despite over shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension , few countries suffered these problems .
In conclusion , water shortage has presented a challenge to individual life and global environment .
While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially , they might have a positive impact on water shortage in a long term .
You may not have never thought about it but you ///would///could///might/// be able to jump from a plane if you wanted .
If you ask me why I enjoy my favourite sport so much , I would n't hesitateto answer .
First of all , the best thing about skydiving is the excitement and the discharge of adrenalin .
When you are sitting on the plane next to your instructor , with your legs hunging and your arms crossed … It makes an indescribable impression on you .
Finally , you are around 4000 meters high and after 60 seconds of free fall at 200 km / hour , your parachute is opened and you are flying about 5 minutes until you land on the floor .
As you can imagine , there are some advices that you should do///know if you want to take it up .
I 'm sure you will agree that it can be one of your best experiences if you pay attention to your instructor all the time .
Plus , you should wear a sweater or jacket to avoid to be cold /// being cold because you are flying on the sky , over the clouds .
And obviously , you should n't be afraid of hights to enjoy skydiving fully .
Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting .
Besides , camera work , props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features , while staging implies actors to convey their play through body movements and energy .
It is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting .
The stage actor is armed with props , costumes and light as well as the film actor .
The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing work and special effects .
But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors .
So I would say those types of acting are even in the sense of external factors .
Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors .
The only thing that differs is that film actor has several takes opposed to stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash .
And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate emotions and feelings of their model character .
The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect .
I would say , it does n't matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timber of voice as if you 're acting as your main character , embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation .
Furthermore people actively use private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters and bicycles .
Tourists can encounter with difficulties such as a traffic jam .
Sometimes it is very difficult to come home in rush hour because of traffic jams .
There are some disadvantages of banning cars .
This idea also would be unpopular because it limits a freedom of choice .
In my view the best solution to all problems would be limitation of private transport in the centre but not absolute banning .
All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention .
Firstly , the article ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' shows a new research , in which it 's possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read .
In addition , using this identification may assist parents , educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on a video - therapy , which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
All in all , if you want to read about an effective research with very strong proposals , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' .
Tom has joined a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital and this was his first day .
He will deal with temporarily disabled people who come for a rehabilitation session every other day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people 's experience and perception about their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center .
The ultimate aim is to get a feedback for service - improvement purpose .
Tom has prepared a set of questions to ask .
He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity will not be revealed .
We all know the situation , when we are in supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same , but one of it costs much more than the other .
Here we have brand products and no name products .
Now the question is , if it is really justified that brand products are much more expensive than no name products .
Most people associate brand products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no name products are just cheap and without any quality and a bad taste .
In surveys , it was asked if consumers would rather buy brand products or no name products .
Most of the consumers said , they would buy brand products .
After that the consumers made a blind taste test .
The product without brand tasted better to nearly everybody .
As a result you can say it is not always justified that brand products are more expensive than comparable other ones .
Only the brand and the good marketing makes it that expensive , not better quality or better taste .
The effect of media on people is clearly noticeable here .
It is like " Everybody has it , I need it too ! "
In some cases it may be true that brand products are better than no names , for example technology products , but products like Red Bull or others like that , are definitely not always better .
Here it is said , try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust on advertisements .
We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition , and we were looking forward to our trip for months .
The passport was ready in an hour , so we were hurrying to the gate and got on the plane .
You do n't have to worry about getting to my house , because it 's really simple , and I 'm helping you making it even more simple by picking you up at the train station of my town .
The underground it 's in the airport and it 's very easy to reach because you just have to follow the signs .
Once you 're in the train station , go where they sell tickets and buy one for Viterbo .
Get the train and jump off at the " Viterbo " stop - I will be right out of the station waiting for you !
In this period it 's mostly sunny and warm , but in the evening it gets a little cold and windy so bring some jumpers or sweaters ...
That 's why I think that waiting in queues is essential at any place .
Otherwise , the place would turn into a mess , especially the crowded places .
It may seems boring and time wasting to wait in queues , but it is n't .
Also , that make them do their jobs efficiently .
That would make them feel disabled .
In conclusion , people will do what they want smoothly and politely , if they wait patiently in queues .
I 'm Sara and I 'm a half - italian , half - spanish , seventeen years old girl with a really cheerful , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a web site and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English , but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them , actually I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end up with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never had any experience of this kind before , but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who 's seven years old with whom I use to play a lot when I do n't have to study .
I 'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings out , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children .
I started cooking when I was fourteen years old , but I 'm better at baking , so I could help preparing some sweets for children .
They would obviously be as healthy as possible and I would be really careful about those children who have allergies , and try to bake something that also them can eat .
I speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points over 100 at both KET and PET certification .
English is also my favorite language since I was a child , I started studying it at the age of three with a really nice teacher named Helen and I continued improving my English watching American movies and TV shows during the past few years .
Best regards .
Firstly I started a new job , it did not turn out they way I hoped unfortunately .
My colleauges are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them .
Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfuntional .
While we might talk about our job a bit too much I do n't think it is uncomfortable to work side by side .
I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network , of these the live roleplay looks promising .
Lastly I hope next year will bring some stability .
While I do not wish top continue to work and live like this , I am not sure I want to move again .
But I ca n't imagine in can be as bad or worse then my current job .
If I move again I know it would take another year to find other people at least .
I am not sure Vastervik has that kind of clientel .
Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , quiet , always on time and always the first of his class .
He closed the window not to hear the laughs and yells of his friends , playing soccer in the field in front of his house : " I never liked soccer , anyway " he kept telling himself , but the more he tried , the harder it get to focus on his book .
He felt like a character in a cartoon , with an angel on a shoulder and a devil on the other , giving him opposite pieces of advice , and exactly like such a character , he did n't know who to listen to .
Suddenly the doorbell rang , distracting him from his inner struggles , and he heard his Mother opening the door .
He stood up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at his book once again and finally got out of his room and said " Please mom , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
By a wide definition , teachers are the people who teach you .
If parents want to get these abilities , they need to spend extra time to learn .
Because everyone has their own talents , values , and judgments , we learn more from those with whom we agree and appreciate and get significant influence from them .
These people can be deemed as the best teacher in our life , even if these people perhaps are not our parents .
The reason for my choice is simple and clear : the French revolution was the turning point in the European modern history and , thanks to its achievements , people in the twenty - first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech , assembly , worship and , the most important one , freedom of thought .
It is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years after the revolution ) , but I 'm sure it was a gorgeous city as it is nowadays .
I fancy its streets crowded by workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution .
They meet at midnight to listen to the speechs of the leaders .
I would do my best for making their imprisonment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty .
Because no revolution is worthier than a human life .
Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today .
But only until yesterday ! My professor told us that our final exam in this course would be on July 5th .
As you know I 'm not the best student and I 've already failed in this exam twice , so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester .
Otherwise I will be taken off the university register .
To be honest I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight .
You do n't know how ashamed I feel now , not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets ( and I can imagine how difficult it must have been ) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible .
Do you maybe have a friend who you would like to go with to the concert since we ca n't go together ?
I would let you the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it is n't with me .
Otherwise I could sell both tickets and we can have a look if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany .
I have been proving my abilities by overcoming arduous competitions since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion in persuasion and problem solving .
Throughout my undergraduate studies , my professional skills were recognized at the internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State .
At this period , I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court .
On the other side , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Great Honors in 2007 .
I was placed in the top 10 with a GPA of 8.73 out of 10 .
My bachelor thesis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimously awarded by the Jury with the maximum score of 10 .
This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulation of trade , that conduces me to this LLM and the international business transactions domain .
Since my Law school graduation , many achievements encouraged my professional development .
First , upon graduation , I immediately joined a highly recognized firm , performing a double role of legal consultant and sub - manager , when I was only 22 years old .
On the same year , I succeeded the strenuous Brazilian Bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work within and cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence extent demanded , I specialized in Economic law with a master 's degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five , I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I developed a multidisciplinary research applying the economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly comprehend the theoretical ascertainment for this career , which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross - border transactions , giving the increasingly requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions .
Furthermore , I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in an international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher .
The LLM in International Business Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome aimed .
Man has evolved over the years , since the invention of the wheel , to space craft expeditions .
Our specie has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to suppress , a problem that has been haunting us since unmemorable times : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had been eradicated from America , but soon another problem originated and took its place .
The movie " The Color Purple " displays a variety of situations from Afro - American people who suffered because of their skin color , known as racism , which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination from one race to another .
In this period of time , the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro - Americans , they had the control and they were in charge of the political and economic activity , while the Afro- Americans did the hard work ; as shown in the movie , most of the men where in charge of the crops .
They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all , it was absolutely forbidden , and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs .
Afro - Americans were completely segregated , Caucasians found it impossible to live among them , that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to .
Afro - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering , and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in the Afro - American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways , men were the undisputed authority in the house .
It makes me feel sad to realize that racism is still a problem from which society suffers . I wonder , Why do we have the necessity of feeling superior to other people ?
We are all equal to God 's eyes , and I believe we all have the same right of living a peaceful life based on mutual respect .
It had been a long and rainy day ; Tom had been working all day and was very tired and hungry .
As usual , he decided to sit on the bar and order some fish and chips .
Surprised he thought he had n't seen her for a long time .
As they talked they came to realize that they had been working at offices which were very near for almost a year .
First of all , our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars .
Although there are many other polluters , such as big industries , people should start with the easiest resolutions .
Although many countries do not offer a good public transport service , once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements .
For instance , Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this .
It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to better future .
Unfortunately , not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides .
For example , it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious .
It is a fight for the better and healthier future .
Dear college
About the task that you ask me to do , unfortunately I do n't have enough knowledge about LIMS yet .
I understand that the new programme have some specific requisites related to preservation of analysed samples .
Nevertheless , all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from wet chemistry laboratory and from microbiology laboratory gave to me .
Of course that if you have any suggestions please tell me .
I will transmit it to them and we will discuss them .
Suppose that we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand of a particular analysis .
International suppliers take , at least a week to deliver an order .
It was a cold winter night and the moon was fighting the clouds for freedom , much like any of us fighting through our life and it 's obstacles .
Michael however , made a living off his fights , at a young age Michael was attacked and mugged in the street so he started taking martial arts lessons lest he be bullied again .
If the demolition crew camp in front of my place again tomorrow I 'll just show them the form ...
" he said taking a pill . "
But then again what good is a useless piece of paper ? " he panicked , putting the box on the night stand he did n't even understand the passing of time !
Until he had calmed enough to go feed his dog , his one best friend , the dog he and his fiance ' bought before it broke off .
The Labrador really took him back to his engagement ...
He was doing well despite his sad life .
His anxiety caught up to him every now and then but the good doctor had prescribed him a good remedy !
Suddenly Michael heard a thud from his upstairs bedroom , Called Baxter and took a bat with him upstairs .
Michael rushed to his bedroom with a fatal mixture of fear and adrenaline in his system , only to see his box of pills on the ground and the sound of muffed but heavy breathing coming from behind the door .
Michael closed the door , saw his dog gasping for air and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is well accepted that whenever you become a famous person you lose your privacy .
Whether they like it or not , right from the beginning all you do becomes attractive for the mob : what you eat , where you go , who you date to , your possible marriage , your holidays , etc .
I agree with the fact that as soon as your life is not private anymore , famous people have to face journalists with a smile they do not have .
I mean by this that for sure there are some days in which these famous people are in a bit of a mood , they have to visit the doctor , or they have to solve mishaps with lawyers , and they have stuck those journalist following till the door or awaiting them stationed in front of their houses .
In these cases , jounalists themselves should realize that they are taking it too far and that they should respect them a bit more .
During this period , the town has seen extensive growth in residential areas and local amenities , and a modernisation of leisure faclilities .
Parks in the north - east and south - east have been reduced to make way for larger housing estates the one in the north dramatically increasing accommodation in Eastminister .
south of the river , an industrial area has been constructed next to the existing railway while residential streets have been converted into more modern apartment blocks .
With increasing housing has come a bigger hospital and more shopping facilities the existing shops being built on the site of the old school , with a new school opening on the north bank of the river .
I like the way you gave examples how you felt and how you would change your own lessons .
However , when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students ca n't be quiet and ca n't sit without making a move .
Moreover , when we as teachers have a study day , I get tired myself by sitting all day .
In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again .
as I see it , it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes .
I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films .
However , I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming .
Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues .
For instance , when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4 I feel incompetently .
It gives me the feeling that most important of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activate pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results .
She was walikng around the city thinking about the job she just lost .
Yes , she should accept this proposition .
Everything was looking perfect and it was something she enjoyed ndoing before the accident took place .
But then something gone wrong and she just walked away .
He made her feel bad so why would she do n't do the same ?
BUt it was okay .
The dark clouds above the sky , full of life , seemed to mock his little desire to live .
He could heard the thunders shouting with rage , a rage he wished he could feel again .
He stared at an object on the beside table , the object that could free him from this hell like existence .
Could bliss we found in dead ?
Was it the best part life could offer ?
its own end ? .
He placed a hook over the door , tied the object to it and standing on a chair put the object around his neck .
He looked at the clouds , they were still grey , and then for a moment , he saw a tinny fragment of a rainbow .
This is easy word to understand , but it hides more than defination says .
All the people need these things and the best givers are family members because they give unconditionally .
My family members all the time expression their warm feelings with hugs , kisses and beautiful words .
For example my parents hug me every day .
My mother makes me breakfast every morning and my brother brings me cookies , when I have a bad mood .
These small thing gives me a lot .
Also they always support me no matter what I do or think .
Usual friends can often say " no " or let me down , but my family never does that .
My family knows most of my secrets , they know my worries and joys , they know that I am thinking about things .
They fulfill all the functions that my friends has , and they fulfill them even better .
As a result , some sources of energy like nuclear power are used for our daily life .
Fossil fuels are our most common energy source , even though , they produced a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere .
Just look at oil , nature takes millions of years to form it and we have almost ended it .
Nuclear power plants have a high risk of pollution in case of accident .
In addition , they produce nuclear waste which is a major problem for the environment and public health .
All things considered , I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it does n't damage global warming although it is expensive to afford .
No , it is not rational because according to the economic theory , you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , than it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
Her utils are at their highest the more she consumes .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act .

Hans Feurer is a mainstay of fashion photography since the late 1960s .
The peak of his career was in the early 80-s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's advertising campaign .
1967 Feurer 's career went up like a rocket .
At the same time he worked for the Pirelli calendar in 1974 he also featured shots that appeared in Elle , Vogue , Numero , etc .
More than 30 years ago , in the remote deserts of North America , Hans Feurer was given free to photograph Kenzo Takedo 's 1983 advertising campaign .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model Iman also began after this pioneering shooting .
These images became the subject of Feurer 's eponymos book , lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs , illustrating his five - decade long career .
Weight lifting is involves the basic and most natural human movements .
Obviously the weight is the resistance , which will help the individual to gain strength and mass .
Every time I go to the gym I feel like I have to breaking my limits and replace them with the feeling of success .
The best advice I can give for a newbie is to do not go the gym at all without knowledge .
Look up on the Internet how to execute the exercises properly .
Eating healthy foods are the other part of that sport .
I rather call that a life style .
Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category .
Conversely , the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and the dark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes are considered , it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of the Victorian society , with a wide range of characters and stories which reveal the conditions of children and the poor ; instead the Brontes ' novels contain the Byronic hero , a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge , as Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ENGLISH COURSE
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the wishes of the students who took part in the survey that was conducted lst week in our school .
However , there are some defficiencies that could be fixed .
Firstly , there is a great demand among our students of a computer room with broadband Internet connection .
It is well known that this kind of facility help students make the most of their time while learning English .
Not only the bedrooms are rather small , but also are they quite cold , because of the lack of a heating system .
There are also numerous complaints in regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen .
It will be advisable to change the catering service .
We will be grateful if any of these problems were solved by the committee .
In case you need further information regarding any of these issues , please contact us and I will be glad to respond you as soon as possible .
Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend with each of your activities , it could work out and you would n't need to drop any of them .
However if you are still very stressed , then you might drop one of them , I certainly do n't know which one you should drop , I think I would drop the music lessons , because sports are good for your physical and mental health , and also help you to be fit and it 's more interesting for me ; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you .
Start asking yourself Which one do you like the most ?
Environmental problems today are more worrisome , if we not do something for our planet , in a few years we will suffer the consequences .
No time to speculate , it is time to act and implement all these measure we know .
Enough talk , is time to make a decision : we want a better world , or , we want to see it destroyed in a few years .
Simple things like recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using cars , not throwing garbage on the streets or oceans , can mean a considerable change , because if we add the small efforts of each of us , the results are translated into millions of people .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No more blah blah blah , it 's time to save the world " , we may not have super powers and not be " Superman , Ironman , Captain America , Batman , etc . " and we save the planet from intergalactic threat but unlike them , all together we can save the planet from an even greater threat , its total destruction due to pollution and environmental problems that we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to provoke , we have to have the courage to do something to fix , let us become that super hero that changed the world and made a change for future generations to have a healthy environment to live .
Just think about your future and in your family , and when you see rubbish lying in the street , remember that you can become the superhero that someday be satisfied because he did something to save the planet .
It 's time to bring the superhero we have inside ; good luck !
Variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients .
They would also enjoy our museums and galleries which can bring them closer to our history and traditions .
More students would be attracted when the school government made some changes in the learning system .
I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one - to - one lessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will be also beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject .
Therefore , it is needed to provide new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learning would be a great idea of attracting more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities , so that more work will be implemented .
Improvemnts on socialising opportunities
The school government should offer more extra - curricular activities , including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most .
I would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students making their accommodation in the town more pleasant .
I know plenty of amazing English courses but they all have different prizes .
I 've seen a couple of advertisements on English courses in our town , but they do n't seem very useful .
However , if you want to have a look at them , they are put up on the supermarket .
I 've got a cousin who works as an English teacher and she has an academy right next to the city council .
You can choose the time and the days you will like to go and she has fantastic offers if you do not want to spend a huge amount of money .
I leave you her mobile phone in case you need it : 681234567 .
However much Roman law , Mosaic law , and rabbinical law impacted lives of Jews living in first - century Israel , many people who followed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the borders of the Roman Empire .
The metaphor is the Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphere of international law , it is wrong to understand the commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obligations toward God . . .
Israel obedience to commandments was not a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love
I always go to have a pizza in a restaurant near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolitan restaurant , that makes pizza and all the Neapolitan specialties , as all the type of fried .
It uses only fresh ingredients from naples that come there every day .
The place remembers the atmosphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with pictures of the most famous Neapolitan people on the wall .
You can sit there and wait for your pizza while watching the football match or bring your pizza home .
The owner Patrizio , is really nice and you can often find him out of the restaurant talking to some guest .
I think it could be suitable for my class because it has two halls and one of them is always used for big groups of people , like us , the service is really rapid and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful square where we can have a drink while watching the typical Neapolitan evening .
Obviously everyone loves pizza , so it 's the perfect place .
But , in fact , the car provides much better mobility needs , both in the big cities as on the countryside .
Our daily life is thoroughly planned , from the morning to the night .
We must keep doing our day - to - day concerns at work and at home , and , at the same time , keep holding our social life and entertainment activities .
Modern life orders our days and weeks in a packed schedulle of activities : job , children , housework , fun , free time ...
We have to go fast from one place to another , just to be in time for fulfilling next task or activity .
It 's for that we need to improve our mobility skills and private transport , as a car , allows us to achieve more efficiently our goals .
But , on the other hand , travelling by car gives us more comfort and saves time , and it offers a wider range of choices of departure and routes .
Every day the science and the industry are developing new materials , technologies and clean energy sources .
As industrial and technological development progresses , public transport will lose passengers and the use of private cars will spread anywhere around the world .
only then can you really start to speak .
When you are on holiday , try to make contact with other English - speakers , and who knows ?
i find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words , and help me recycle words I know in new contexts .
This is a very common argument : the true genius stands out so much that can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized then he is not a genius .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accept the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that in history geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true , or at least is not demonstrable .
They take for granted that historically geniuses have always been recognized , but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history , and therefore can not be used as an opposite example .
In the 19th century for some , such as Cesare Lombroso , geniality resembles mental illness .
For Lombroso exceptional people are independent , away from the banality of life , isolated , impatient , asocial , often considered crazy .
The time in the university is the most important time in our lives because , we learn lot of things and it prepares us for our future career .
Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion of professor and student .Others may disagree .
They prefer classes with lecture and almost no discussion .
In my opinion classes with discussion are better .
First , classes with discussion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because they learn how to interact with their fellow student .
Doubtlessly , such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things .
For instance , a year back I was in north Texas university in USA , there was a health management and policy class with almost no lecture but with lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I thought this was disadvantage but this was not true .
On one day we spoke about medical treatment cost in different country and one of my friend , Wole was from Nigeria .
Consequently , he was able to tell us how the cost of the treatment are less , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody has access to primary health care .
As a result we all know what to be done so that we can make little changes in the reform to lessen the cost of the treatment .
As you can see , open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help you to understand different nation 's policies .
Second , open discussion in the class help you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker .
In order to get good grades we are forced to participate in discussion .
As a result I overcome my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students and I found its not difficult as I expected .
This experience taught me that it is better ti participate in a class with open discussion because it provide you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career .
All in all though some may oppose my opinion , it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lecture are preferable because interaction with other student will broaden your mind and you become a better speaker and thinker .
with reference to your job announcement I am submitting my application for the vacancy at Green Pepper Cafe .
Being a student of economics in this town ( expecting to graduate next year ) I am currently searching for a job at weekends .
Your job description sounds to be a good fit for my search since I am well experienced in serving guests and have a good knowledge of various kinds of foods .
My tasks included back office administration and services in the hotel 's restaurant .
Being ranked in the Michelin 's guide , this restaurant provides more than 50 different dishes .
I love to serving customers and to dealing with different and complex situations .
Should you require further information , I will be happy to provide them .
I hope you 're ok , by the way .
It 's an excellent idea , of course we should go , I bet there are lots of things to do so we can have a great time .
Well , all your suggestions sound good to me , however , I would probably choose climbing because not only is it an extreme sport but it is also an exciting activity I would like to try .
About Saturday evening , why do n't we just stay at home and watch some One Direction videos ?
I do n't know if my parents will be here on Friday , I 'm afraid not , they 've been working so much !
He stared at the clock hanging in the wall and frowned .
It was late , and there was a lot of work to do , so he 'd better catch up .
By the time he arrived at the rivershore , some of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
The river was flowing down with great noise , and its level was slowly rising up , as it had been happening for the last few days .
The crops might be flooded very soon if they did n't do anything to avoid it .
They worked all day long , restlessly , until they were breathless and their hands were bleeding .
He gazed at it , a bit worried about the possibility of more raining during the night , but proud of having put the farm in shelter .
We human beings are highly socialized creature in the world .
Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society .
However , considering the complexity of the society , I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills , on which their progeny count .
For example , one of my senior high school 's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other 's family .
As a consequence , they never talk to each other since then .
Following the previous paragraph , there will always be people of different living styles , attitudes , and beliefs in every aspect of one 's life .
Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled before entering the society .
The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member .
In contrast , living in a society is another story : people might blame , compete , or even hurt others no matter who you are .
Learning in schools , however , provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , proves the way for being independent in the future .
In a nutshell , there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society .
School , a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives , might be better than learning merely with the parents .
Although it 's true that I do n't actually love sports , once I found golf it totally engaged me !
By playing golf you can enjoy a wonderful journey in touch with the nature and even with some friends , while you do some healthy , constant and not too tiring exercise !
If you like the great views from a high hill , as well as having a relaxing time with yourself or sharing it with other people , golf is the perfect sport for you .
The only disadvantage I could find is that golf is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a lot of expense and also a good mental and psychological health , which is the first thing I recommend to work on if you want to enjoy golf from the beginning .
I totally encourage you to try it at least once and I 'm sure you will desire to repeat !
It slowly rustles and clatters and it 's pulsing waves attract so much that you ca n't stand sitting still much longer and you are ready to throw up everything and run towards it .
However , at the last moment , you understand that the ocean is there , in eternally beloved Spain .
Long before our journey I knew that I would love this country , I would fall in love with ocean and sea once for all .
I was wrong only about one thing : I had loved it long ago .
I had been adoring the sea and dreaming about it when I had never seen it before , never heard it before , but definitely felt it not by skin but my heart .
The main advantage of it is that the ocean is always near at hand , no matter in what part of the town you are .
Like in all the seaside towns , it 's always windy there .
So , that 's why I gave up the idea to do it and decided to be a shaggy - girl= )
Also I remember sweat perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of old town and mixing with the smell of fried fish that is ready to be served in numerous bars , cafes and restaurants .
I remember the warmth of twilight wnich lures you to the heart of this town .
I remember the laugh of people , sitting at the tables and chatting .
I remember children , running about the small squares in fronf of the cathedrals ; elderly people in wheelchairs ...
All these memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my eyes , everything in my mind heart is too vivid to forget .
A language it is the capital thing to learn because it is the way people communicate and organize their thoughts .
Furthermore , it gives you the chance to enjoy the works done in that language .
Nevertheless , when you are learning a language , it brings confussion .
On the one hand the old one could be hard wired into your brain .
It also has another negative effect , you have limited time on this planet .
There are an incredible amount of things to learn .
Why would you waste your time learning a new language , when you probably do not know enough about your own .
But , as a learner of my third language , I am a firm believer it is the right choice .
We are delighted to inform you that charity dinner was a success .

No change , no life . Nature is life and death , construction and destruction .
No change , no Nature .
To stop the change is impossible That would be against Nature and against ourselves .
Every single word causes a gesture , a thought , a change in the others .
Any decision changes future .
Life and change have also a direction , an aim : growth .
To inhibit the growth of a living being is a cruelty , but sometimes it happens .
Think of those Chinese women obliged to constrain their feet .
Equally cruel , it is , in my opinion , to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing .children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave as femmes fatales in video - clips or magazine covers .
Nature is also change , but in a cycling direction , and in a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days and nights , the sequence of seasons … , in short , the wheel of life .
We lived in a time of accelerated changes .
Technology allows us to do and learn in one life 's time more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations .
But at the same time we are working against Nature - let 's think of pollution and climate change - and against our own human nature : distress , allergies , strokes and heart attacks are nowadays more and more frequent .
Shopping is very important for people .
But some people can get annoyed by this kind of activity . They may be irritated by loud music in the shopping areas , long queues at the cash desk and crowds of customers everywhere .
I do n't belong to any of these groups , because I am not addicted to shopping , but I do love the process of choosing clothes , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping with my father as he is always advising stupid stuff .
Actually , this is a wrong idea , because I must not waste money on things that are not worth buying .
My name is Alex Yegorov and I am writing to request information about qualification requirements for obtaining a skills assessment in order to submit my Expression of Interest in SkillSelect .
I would appreciate it if you could send me necessary applications forms and associated information relating to the assessment .
It would be appreciated if you could provide assessment procedures , timeframes and charges as well .
I graduated from the University with specialisation in Fiber - optic Transmission Systems .
However now I am working and planning to continue working as a Software Engineer ( 261313 ) .
Would Telecommunications Engineer ( 263311 ) be the right nominated occupation for me ?
Also may I have information on which version of the IELTS should I take , the Academic or the General Version ?
The European Union is created and meant to be an organization that helps all of its members to develop economically and socially while contributing to the common good of the whole union itself .
It works towards allowing all the EU citizens to travel and work freely no matter which country they are from .
Everyone must be accepted and integrate in a specific society .
There should be a working network for providing suitable jobs and standard of living to those , of course , who are looking to work and contribute to society , and do not simply expect to lay on the back of a more economically developed countries .
Many non - EU citizens live and work in Europe but for this to be successful they have to be able to integrate into their receiving society .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , the priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years old , realized that the wine drunk at the moment of communion is not the truly blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whole life .
" I realized about this fact last December when I cut my finger while I was cooking and I sucked the blood that was flowing from the wound " .
Inocencio , surprised by this discovery , asked to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood , incredibly , after a needlestick in their fingers , all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted in Holy blood at the church .
At that time , the Order sent to Vatican an urgent message and called the press for making the announcement of the discovery .
At this press conference Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit .
I 'm glad to hear from you again ! I have to say that you should write in your work that the traditional Portuguese food is delicious !
Usually my eating habits are similar to the most Portuguese ; I have my breakfast around 7.30 and 8.00 , I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals .
At lunch many people eat a lot ! I start with a small soup and then I have the main dish and the desert .
In the afternoon I eat some cookies .
It 's pork which is seasoned with red wine and , then , is well braised .
He was always doing things for them or anyone who asked him .
He lived in Toronto , which is cold city , but which is even colder at 5 am , the time when Tom 's day began .
His first stop was the car garage where he had to pay and take his friend Rob 's car .
The price was supposed to be 10 pounds , but they end up being 25 pounds , so Tom had to put money from his own pocket .
As a concecuence , he had no money to pay for a sod , so he was thirsty all morning .
After taking the car out of the garage , he had to drive all the way to the airport and wait for Rob to come .
Tom was getting really anxious , worryng that he would never make it back to his job at 2 pm , the flight arrived .
It was a quarter to two , so tom laid back in his chair , took a big breath and waited for his workmates to come .
It is one os the most significant places in our capital , Moscow .
First of all , I would like to make it clear that " red " is not related to the colour only , this word also means " beautiful " in Russian .
Moreover , in Red Square one can see the Muasoleum , which is also can be called one of the symbols of our capital and the country .
It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what is cultural literacy .
Cultural literacy is Knowing about and respecting the cultures of others .
To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely manageable .
According to UNESCO literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing population growth , achieving gender equality and achieve sustainable development , peace and democracy .
My personal opinion cultural literacy is the way to understand , learn and know about other cultures .
Also you can be understood by other cultures .
Nowadays , the majority of teenagers are not so close with their families as they used to be and mostly they are farther apart from their parents .
The age between 13 to 19 is the revolutionary one .
I get along with my siblings very well but we do not see each other very much .
As a result , we often communicate and we do not exchange opinions as much as other families do . I do not consider them to be my best friends because I can not speak with them as freely as with my friends .
Not to mention that when I am trying to talk to them they always space out and then say that they have their own problems .
A friend will stay on and listen to you in patience .
To sum up , I do not consider my family to be my best friends and neither they do .
I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet , both in number of viewers and players .
There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled .
A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that 's exactly what sets him apart from the others .
While watching or playing any kind of sport , there 's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time untill the clock runs out , the game becomes dull and boring and you ca n't enjoy the excitment that only the uptempo style of play can provide .
The bottom line is ; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand ( as it is for most sports in general ) are the values of practice and awareness .
Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations , and the combination of the two is the only way to success , so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you .
Some people claim that the youth of today is less healthy than they were two decades ago .
Although several causes for this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society , this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people .
However , possibilities to make the youth healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation .
For example , commercials can be used to stimulate youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects .
In conclusion , I feel that not only the ground for the low level of fitness of today 's youth , but also the clue to get youngsters fitter , lies in the modernity .
Good thriller movies have become increasingly rare in the last few years , and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable plots , are full of cliches and since it 's so easy to figure out how they will end , they are usually very boring .
This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing " Looper " and thought " Hey , I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it , and it was actually a really good one ! "
The story is set in the future , about thirty years from now , when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer , a looper , was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body .
By letting his older self go Joe changes his past , and therefore his future , leading to a series of unexpected events , and to an even more unexpected ending !
My expectations were not very high , but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good , in fact it was not boring at all , and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise .
Time travelling is only a means to the development of the story , and the future society is quite similar to the present one , so even if you are not big science fiction fans , I suggest you give this movie a chance , I am sure you wo n't be disappointed .
In the competitive world that we inhabit , dominating a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success .
The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in their kids as to prepare them for an unpredictable future .
The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless that it may compromise their kid 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most wide - spread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply are n't .
This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in the early infancy , as though this capability could be the celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow as child prodigy .
The adepts of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own believe in their child 's potential to become a known genius .
Little known is what was the role played by music in his life and how was his relationship with it previous to his first deed .
Admittedly , I do n't know it myself .
Any one who challenges the aforementioned common - sense is n't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common , but still popular and not scientific , concurrent idea .
The " 10 000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific base , in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that stablished it .
According to this rule , any person can develop a talent after 10 000 hours of training .
This amount of time does n't fit normal workers and students ' tight schedules and busy daily lives , therefore being labeled as unpractical and unachievable .
The normal response to this conclusion is , as I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you do n't have this time available , is the loss of motivation .
Either of them put a heavy burden on parents and on their children .
One asserts that talent is a matter of luck ; the second , of pure time demanding and presumably expensive dedication .
As any other unscientific " truth " that circulates and cause harm to our society , this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised publications on the topic , so that the effective manners of becoming talented in something can be adopted , before the popular believes take our motivation and self - belief away .
This research project will provide us with better understanding and insights into this area through the EM trainees ' narratives and experiences of clinical reasoning development in ED and add to the scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
A narrative approach to explore and investigate clinical reasoning development can provide a vocabulary that encourages us to integrate insights from different frameworks in ways that combine the strengths of each .
Many people do breakfast in the bar with an espresso or a cappuccino and a croissant .
In the morning we 're not used to eating salty food like salami , eggs or cheese .
My first night here I was invited to a dinner mainly for scientists who are up here doing a radio show .
I 'm placed next to Brain Cox and something inside me wilts because I know I am sitting next to a superior being and he will soon find out I 'm a two - celled worm .
I am next to someone who knows what happened to make the big bang , he sees atoms and electrons and even knows what they are .
He does n't think about things that I , a mere mortal does , like whether or not there is food on my teeth , and death .
To me he is greater than any rock star squared .
I am an English teacher here in my country , Spain , and I have worked with children aged 5 - 14 for five years now in different educational centres .
I am quite enthusiastic about being with kids .
I guess that is why I am a bit workaholic .
I love playing sports , singing , swimming , doing handcrafts , and cooking as well . I enjoy teamwork , and I always share new ideas and good experiences with my colleagues .
I have a great character .
I am quite good at organising sport events and games .
I am aged 20 and currently doing a Barcelona University degree in PE .
I am also a Spanish Red Cross camp leader , as I fancy all kinds of sports such as swimming , sailing , kayaking , rock climbing , etc .
I also have a high level of spoken English because for 8 years I had been attending a summer camp in Scotland , where lately I was asked to carry on as instructor .
I would be suitable for the job advertised because I am extrovert , easygoing , hardworking , thoughtful , and love children and practising outdoor activities such as camping , fishing and cooking , I also enjoy teaching children new skills and helping them to develop their self - confidence .
I would welcome the chance of being part of your company 's team since it is a world renowned firm and I am available to travel and change of residence .
Because of this , I would be grateful if you could send me information regarding incorporation to the organization ( date , conditions , etc )
That 's because there 're many scientific facts have been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts have become much more available .
Furthermore , it 's easy to know about these valuable discoveries .
There 're many more libraries and learning courses available than before .
Also , there 're more people who continue their education after graduation from college .
Going to the UK has been a dream of mine but going to Cornwall , however , might be a little of an escapade during the winter , considering that I 'm only used to the relatively hot Egyptian weather .
However , I 'm interested & excited about the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiences .
On the other hand , I hear people are generally convivial and nature is beautiful in Cornwall .
My life has been on a boring plateau for a while now and I was looking for a change as well as more personal burgeon .
There is a place , in my country , which played a very important role during World Ward II .
As it was full of spruces , it was easy to hide from the German patrols and people from both sides of the border helped Jewish , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to flee through Switzerland .
A net took place from South of France to Switzerland , espescially to try to save thousands of Jewish children .
People who participated to that " way to freedom " never asked anything in exchange .
They never spoke about it till a few years ago , as they were considered like criminals by their countries as they had broken the law during that time .
But now , they told the whole world about it , some of them are now considered as heroes in Insrael for what they did during these hard times .
Their story was written and folks finally could discover what happened there between the years nineteen thirty - nine and nineteen forty - five .
Last month a monument was erected in their memory so that nobody forgets what happened in that large forest where - as the people would say in that time - German soldiers can not guard all wood , unless they stood behind each spruce ....
Nowadays , public transport is a useful and convenient way of travelling , especially for students , people with low socioeconomic status or for everyone who wants to go to work or school by bus , train or by subway .
It 's also true that more people have cars than maybe 30 of 40 years ago .
Cars are a good way of saving time especially when waiting for public transport , mainly , buses .
But a disadvantage it that cars maintenance and gas is more expensive than paying for public transport .
Airplanes are becoming more and more useful for people who travel for work or even want to get to another place quicker and safer .
I also think that there would be fewer people using public transport in the future but some will still be available because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a car or travelling by plane .
The function of evaluation and assessment must not only be the recognition of the results of the learning process itself , but also how this process took place , therefore we will need to use different instruments of assessment .
After the assessment and evaluation we will be able to adjust the necessary pedagogic help to individual students , know up to which point the proposed aims have been achieved and we will be able to judge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessment and evaluation will provide information , as well for the teacher as for the students .
As far as the students are concerned , they will be able to correct inadequate strategies or behaviour , know the difficulties they encounter in the learning - teaching process and evaluate their proper process .
As to the teacher , we will find out whether the programme planning was adequate or not and if s / he was sufficiently implied in the learning - teaching process .
Society is continually changing , ever since we create the first civilizations .
It should make a lot of tasks easier and more efficient but , apart from that , I do n't expect it to have a deep impact on our lives , considering other aspects that will certainly overcome this one .
That brings us to second point : resources .
As the population grows exponentially , the resouces fail to go along .
We have just started worrying about that but the actions in course are far from enough .
The hard truth is that until somenoe has to face the situation himself , it 's quite difficult to restrain from wasting energy , food , materials , water ...
But in the near future most of us will have to deal with it and therefore be forced to make dramatic changes in our lives in order to survive .
Finally , and on a more positive tone , we 're walking towards a global world .
It 's really good that you 're coming to Uruguay , I would be pleased to help you .
First of all , there are a lot of places to visit here and I would like to take you to , Punta del Este , Piriapolis , Cabo Polonio , La paloma and other beautiful places .
You have a lot of hotels to stay if you want to be more than a day and the people is really nice , or if you want you can stay at my house of course .
Secondly , You can find a job here in Montevideo or if you like in the countryside .
You could work in a public office for example .
For people who come from other countries like you , there are a lot of internships and I can assure you that you will find a great job , there are also companies that are hiring people to work for a short period of time in their call centers .
I 'm looking forward to see you soon !
We will have a great time together here in Uruguay , You will meet some of the most popular places of this beautiful conuntry .
The pupils have been taught English since their very first meeting with the English language in school so they are completely familiar in using English as classroom language .
The only place where we could imagine a challenge in sticking to English as the classroom language is when the group works .
The evaluation starts by unfolding the brain storm from day 1 , and then it continues by the pupils applying all their new words and knowledge about America .
Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils'minds about their new knowledge .
Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time .
In this class there are strong wishes about certain areas regarding America that the pupils want to learn : 10 pupils would like to learn about American High School Life , 4 pupils would like to learn about National Parks in America , 4 pupils would like to learn about Native Americans and 1 pupil would like to learn about American Motor Industry .
Taking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils'motivation into consideration we have decided that they can follow their interests in this course .
This also gives the pupils the possibility of presenting their classmates to new knowledge - and the communicative situation is authentic .
Kyiv is a good destination for the shoppoholics .
For those interested in top fashion brands I would recommend visiting the shops in the main street .
The best manufacturers of clothes , linnen , accessories have their shops there . Jewellery and watch shops can also be found nearby .
For those who are looking for cheap , but practical clothes I will recommend to go to one of the shopping malls of the capital .
Mass market clothes , bags , cosmetics , children toys are represented there .
Different shops will offer a wide range of goods and impresse with interesting design ideas and unique style .
The main shopping mall of the city is under reconstruction at the moment , but in one year it will be open for visitors and will surprise them with high tech design and exclusive brands .
And if you try to find a good product for a reasonable price visit the city 's outlet - collections of the previous years are sold there with significant discounts .
AIESEC has 64 years of experience in developing high - potential youth into globally minded responsible leaders .
AIESEC members live an integrated development experience .
Why people become homeless ?
One of the reasons is they are poor because they can not get a job .
I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills .
For example , if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live , they can get a financial support by government .
Homeless people tend to unable to collect information because of lack in means to do it .
The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships .
Then , he came to know that there was a class that provide homeless people with skills of cleaning floor for free .
Little by little , he grew interest in working .
He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows .
To conclude , giving information about support that they can receive from the government , and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem , despite others believe deforestation has a higher impact on our world .
This flooding leads to starvation because of fewer harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand deforestation is , as said , another part of global warming due to less carbon dioxide storing trees .
But incinerate a huge part of the rainforest means a destruction of the habitat of wildlife .
Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but also does deforestation .
Because the roots do not hold the fertile soil , and now , it will be blown away by the wind .
To sum up both issues have enormous impacts on our world .
In both animals and people are affected .
But in my opinion , you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first .
Even though their couple was of the quarelling type , everyone around them , friends and family agreed on the fact that the pair was as solid as a rock , and despite the ups and downs , love had always won in the end .
And each time it occurred , Cecilia burst in tears , and Michael had to rock his sobbing wife like a baby .
It took him three days to calm down and put the things in perspective .
Nowadays , experience is more important than academic knowledge to gain a job .
However , experience is extremely important , I disagree that the academics are not important .
Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution .
When employees face any problems or difficulties in work , it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon , without knowing this theory employees ca n't overcome these difficulties , for instance , engineering science seems practical , but each part of engineering science is based on theories .
Thereby , engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees , as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way .
Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems , beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information .
Then employees are able to suggest the best solution , this approach is developed in formal education .
Moreover , studying in a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees .
Finally , knowledge could make an open - mined person who has ability to deal with problems in fairway .
It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in careers .
It is certainly true that markets can not abandon the formal qualification in future .
It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of the day
First what are the advantages of using the bus , or train ?
When traveling to city centers , choosing public transport is to be advised , because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space .
When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights , by car it is hard to get from on place to the other , because the circulation is dense .
IN that way it will take a lot of your time , while the bus or tramway have their own bus lanes , and hence are running smoothly .
In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable .
When traveling to rural areas , it is quite difficult by public transport , because sometimes there is hardly any no train or bus for the far out places and the tiny villages .
Because not may people going to these places , the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour .
Most of these buses will make many stops which makes it even more time consuming .
In the end of the day you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip .
The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan as to resolve legal cases and disputes .
The system , which was in practice since the British rule , was modified under the ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criminal Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases , the Jirga also covers all important aspects of monetary , political , and communal life of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan , law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions .
Strongest allegation on the Jirga system or ' informal justice system ' has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution on variety of its rules and regulations .
In fact informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally owns its roots to Baloch culture and had been transferred to Sindhi society progressively .
Naseer Khan was an able General , trained at the court of Ahmad Shah Abdali , the hero of the third battle of famous Pani Pat . "
In recent years , many nations are developing their own economy rapidly , and it takes that many areas of farmlands and forests are being cut down to build a better and bigger house and a more convenient transportation system .
Frist of all , the biggest problem is that the world 's resources are extremely unequal .
For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
Secendly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the area of farmland is also decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving .
So I think that the government must do something in this respect .
The government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development .
I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the food can make people 's great and then vigorously develop the economy .
As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government but also the task of each of us .
I am in my final year of high school which I will leave with a university entrance qualification in July of this year .
I have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that so far very satisfying .
My babysitting duties were to bring the children to bed , provide lunch or dinner , play with and read to them .
With regard to the tutorials . I have put together my own exercise material , looked and discussed class tests and helped the pupils with their homework .
Since I worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp , I think that I am well - equipped to deal with 8 - 12 year old children from the experience I mentioned .
I hope you will invite me for a job interview , via Skype or in in person and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Suddenly , it got so dark , that I could not see a thing .
I started shouting as my parents were out of sight , but nobody answered .
After a while I started shaking - I was alone in a forest !
So there was nothing better to do but stay in the same place and wait for someone to help me .
I did not have to wait so long , though - after a while I saw our car 's lights glowing in the darkness .
Next time I will be going on such a trip I need to make sure that I have a fully charged mobile with me .
I recently completed the four - year bachelor degree European Studies at Zuyd University in Maastricht .
During the studies , I went abroad to the University of Paris where I studied political sciences and international management .
After my studies I did a master in cultural sciences at the University of Maastricht .
I had worked in a clothing shop in the past , so I have some sales experience as well .
I have done an internship at a reception in one of the best VIP design hotels in Sevilla , Spain .
My duties included check guests in and out , plan and organize group arrivals , assist in cash advances , exchange money , check guest folios and give commercial information to customers .
In this way I have to some extent developed strategic thinking on individual client needs .
During my studies , I had to make several times portfolios and had negotiation classes , so that will be no problem for me .
I am an Italian 24- year - old girl , I studied English during high school and for this reason I travelled in different countries in order to improve the language .
In those places I had the opportunity to communicate with other people from all over the world .
I studied in London for 1 month some years ago and I visited different places such as Brighton or Liverpool where I attended some short summer courses .
I would like to improve my communication skills and I would really love to be an active part of your summer camps trying to do new different things .
For these reasons I think I would be a suitable person for this kind of jobs , I am very open - minded and I love to take care of children because of their beautiful way of thinking and see things in a very simple and natural way .
Cooking is one of the things I like the most and I am not frightened of hardworking since I believe that if you want to improve you have to apply a lot .
I hope you will consider my request , this would actually be a wonderful experience for me .
I would be grateful if you could attend this matter as soon as possible .
I got into his bedroom , and there it was : the letter .
I suddenly knew what had happened , he took his own life , and my heart broke .
Since grandpa passed away I started loving my grandma even more .
That woman knows how to put a smile on kid 's face .
Granny has grey straight hair , deep blue eyes and tiny nose .
She also has pale complexion and black dark circles under eyes .
Grandma 's wrinkled face can be horrofying at night .
She has a really skinny body , and her hand are long and covered in brown spots .
Tone of her voice is so gentle and so calm .
It calmes me down and freaks me out at the same time .
Parents told me that grandma is a very sick person .
And also she is watching me with eyes wide opened .
Lately I could n't get enough sleep because of that .
Nana gives me feeling like I will get killed in my sleep .
It feels just like a horror move .
It is creepy feeling .
But I never thought that it can be that serious .
The Girls used to hang out together , they spent all their free time together and they were absolutely best friends .
Allison was the girl who joined the group together : all of the girls liked her and she was always the centre of attention .
Suddenly Spencer came to the barn , again and told her friends that she had n't seen Allison , instead she thought she 'd heard her scream .
All of the messages include the girls ' secrets oh Allison knew .
And then , Allisons body is found .
In the show , the friends try to find out who " A " is a show Allison was murdered while " A " turns their lives into hell .
On the other hand , lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person 's life as their personal life 's boundaries are constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists .
Besides , the more they succeed , the more their fans expect of them to achieve .
In conclusion , fame may be nice but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
You have money but you do not feel safe , you have friends but you can never be sure if they like you or your money .
I 'm really glad to spend six months in the UK , but it 's really important to plan my days in order to have a good time .
First of all , I would like to work for at least three months in a language school in London as Italian teacher .
In this way I 'd had the chance to know different people from all over the world and at the same time I 'd earn some money to visit the city and the castles of England , where many historical battles were fought .
I was wondering if you do n't mind asking around if a school is looking for a part - time teacher .
After leaving London I 'd love to do two months of volunteering at a children hospital in York .
I read in an ad on the internet that young people are asked to amuse sick children and I 'd be really happy to tear them a smile !
Will you help me writing a striking curriculum ?
My stay is going to conclude with a trip I 've always dreamed : the Cornwall .
I 'm meeting two friends of mine in Bristol where we 're renting a little car and we 're travelling without destination !
Thank you for your advice , kisses !
It had been a hot , summer day .
Michel 's parents were out so it was the perfect excuse to have an amazing party in the living room , even though they forbid him meeting with friends .
When the night fall and all the guests had arrived , Michael started to lose control of the situation .
Suddenly , a deafening noise coming from the dining room stopped the party but nobody knew what happened .
Almost immediately the house was empty , and music turned off , letting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase valued in £ 2000 was broken down .
Michael decided to blame the dog for the unfortunate incident and when he told his father what had happened automatically he put the dog up for adoption as it was n't the first time , despite of Michael 's attempts to avoid him doing it .
Once they had arrived to the shelter the family started to say goodbye to the dog crying out loud .
Having lived in four different cities ( Brighton , London , Manchester and Cambridge ) in the UK , I have become more flexible to new environment and keen to accept new challenges .
Given my strong academic background and my leadership experiences at university , including the completion of Manchester Leadership Programme , I believe I am a strong candidate for this position . I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview .
She had dreamed of living there since she was a little girl , but she also realized that she will leave all the people that she cared about .
At this point , no one knew that she did the interview and the interviewer told her that the job was hers .
Not even her boyfriend knew about this , and she felt ashamed because deep inside her , she did knew that he will feel betrayed and probably he did n't want to be with her anymore .
But if she did n't take this job , she would regret it her whole life , and live with that was something she was not willing .
She thought that she could have done things different , but it was too late to change them .
I am a very energetic , hardworking , caring , tolerant , fun to be with 30 years old woman who loves spending time with children .
Furthermore , as a former scout I have necessary skills in organizing different sports games and I am familiar with wide range of evening activities .
In addition , as a mother of 8 and 12 years old boys , I have a vast knowledge of children 's psychology and am an excellent cook .
Besides , while being as an exchange student in the USA during my school years , I have improved my English speaking and communication skills .
Regarding the living arrangements , as I understand , food and accommodation are provided by the summer camp .
And I am confident that I would be a beneficial member of your summer camp team .
Looking forward to your reply , please feel free to ask me any questions .
But then , every once and a while , one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance , or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision .
The members of your family in deed are your best friends , but only if you do n't take them for granted , if you respect them and their space and opinion .
I have been asked last week to write a report about the best places for young people in my area .
Those are my findings and my recommendations .
It was renewed last year and regulars like it a lot .
Kids have to pay 10 euros just for the entrance getting anything else .
- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall .
It has 150 stores and about 40 fast food shops .
They especially like the music store and a magnificent t - shirt store owned by two local designers , there you can design your own item and collect it the following week .
My name is Susanne White and I would like to apply for the position as a camp assistant advertised on the Crash Magazine .
I will be on vacation from July to September and I would be glad to work again with children .
Apart from my experience in Arts , I also have been doing gymnastics for ten years ; therefore I am a sporty girl .
An individual must be aware of the result of his act on the environment , be it due to personal or professional act , in order to maintain it in healthy state .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging the ones who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against the ones who tend to cause harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town .
Earlier , regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not , it was disposed off in the same bin .
Later , people were educated regarding recyclable , non - recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed - off in respective bins .
Hence , the municipal board decided to invite the developers as well in the meeting that was scheduled in a weeks time .
In the following meeting , it was decided that on the following Sunday everyone will be planting a tree that will be provided by the municipal board for free .
On the following Sunday , as discussed , trees were planted and before we realized , they started adding beauty to our town .
Taking care of environment is everyone 's duty and it must be performed responsibly .
The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job in educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state .
I hope people must take them as an example and introduce similar ideas in their own towns or villages .
One day Michael woke up from a strange dream , the dream was focused from a camera that was following a shadow in front of it .
Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that way .
The shadow kept walking and running from what Michael supposed it was a threat .
Michael was confused , he did n't know why he had dreamed that , he thought it would be better to forget about it so he stopped thinking about his dream .
That day Michael had to go to work , so he woke up from his bed and went to his bathroom .
When he was ready he took his keys and everything he needed , he locked the door and went to his job .
He took his car and drove to the flat .
When he arrived at the building where he worked he took the elevator and when to his floor .
Since he had entered the building he have had a strange feeling , when he arrived to his office Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Further to our phone conversation of last week , I would like first to thank you for giving me this chance to talk to you , and following up on our discussion , please note that we have been approached by the purchasing department at the hospital to give them our maximum discount to secure the deal as a lot of brokers were quoting with a very competitive price which very close to our cost .
In light of the above , and as agreed I seek your kind help in approving the price of $ 30.00 per each to close this deal in a safe way .
After an hour Mindy was holdin her baby- girl and Peter was trying to realize what had just happened .
" Never would have I thought that I 'll go out of my house and come back as almost an accousher ... " thought Peter when he was driving back home .
Computer 's have become an essential part of our lives in the last few decades .
They have replaced many things like books .
However , they stopped us from doing many fun things as well , what are those things , do we really need computers , are they really helping us ?
They were invented to help us calculate things in the first place anyway .
But us , ordinary people , do n't use computers to solve equations , we use them to type things , print things , design things , make games and to do much more ...
We made programs that make computers do very interesting things , like graphics .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers made easier for us is , communication .
Humans are social animals , we communicate because communication is in our genes , if we do n't communicate we go insane .
So computers help us do that , they help us share our thoughts and feelings with other people easily .
In the other hand , computers have very bad effects on both to us , and the environment .
Also looking at a screen is tiring for your eyes and if your eyes get too tired they can get damaged forever .
Computers made our lives easier without doubt , so it is normal that they have some bad effects .
There is a saying in Turkish saying ' If you love a rose , you have to withstand against it 's spikes . ' .
In my opinion computers might be the best invention ever made , since they 've become an essential part of our daily lives and since we rely on them so much .
Lucila Marcelo and I have met at secondary school and we have been friends for seven years .
We have also worked together in a kindergarten for some time and this year we started our studies in an institution in order to become primary teachers .
Lucila has proved herself to be extremely sincere and reliable person since I met her .
As a student , she is persistent and hardworking as well as respected by teachers and students because of her sympathy and kindness .
Lucila is the biggest out of six siblings so she is used to babysitting children .
When we worked at the kindergarten she was very patient and caring with the children and also she was willing to help them whenever they had a problem , even if that implied had work for her .
I can confirm that she had a special connection with the kids : she was admired by them , who would spend a great time with her .
She would undoubtedly do an excellent job and for the reasons I have given I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on theory .
What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .
I am a native Spanish speaker who has a very good level of English and also I have spent 5 years living in the United Kingdom .
I am used to organising sporting events and fun activities for children and teenagers aged between 6 - 19 .
In addition , I have experience working in restaurants during the summer so I am used to all types of kitchen duties including cooking and washing up .
Nobody can argue with the fact that education is a relevant period in the development of a child .
Learning new languages is very important , but also studying subjects related to computers and technology like computer programming is becoming more and more useful than ancient languages like Greek or Latin .
This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study in particular and an important instrument in life in general .
On one hand , it allows the students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past .
On the other hand , this does not bring too many employment opportunities .
Recent surveys proved that the study of these languages does not add much to the students future success .
Related to learning computer programming , it guarantees a good living .
Furthermore as technology changes more and more , there will be a greater demand of these skills in the future .
It is evident that technology is in every aspect of our lives .
In conclusion , there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school , but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any school serious programme .
I consider them as my favorite band since 2010 , because I had the chance to get to meet them watching The X Factor 's episode where they auditioned .
When they dropped their second album , I was so excited about it and I waited like 2 hours on the line of a music shop to get it . Years passed by , and I was still a fan of them , as I am now .
It contains twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song .
That fascinating album surprises not only the variety of subjects but also the strength of instrumental sounds .
The first single , ' Brave ' , is a chart - topping song about emotions such as fear and fight .
It is bound to be at the top of my list .
False alarm , which is the second track , is totally different and mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings well - known from the film ' Once " song called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fantastic way but listeners get used to the first version might be disappointed .
Musically satisfying ' Happy in my heartache ' tells the story of tragic love .
I definitely recommend that album to your collection .
Besides , he also came to being keen on learning foreign languages so much so that he decided to enroll on courses of French and German .
When the exam was finished , he went out the room where the competition had been held .
The reason I am writing to you is poor quality of a food processor , which I bought in your store two weeks ago .
After using two times , problems started to appear .
I noticed that the first malfunction was safety lock which demanded applying of great force .
We discovered that another problem when tried to use the blender .
It started working but suddenly got stuck and we were unable to use it since .
I was very surprised to discover that many problems in a quite expensive model .
After two weeks the food processor had still not arrived .
As a solution he offered that upgrade my model to a better and this too will take two weeks .
I am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service have I received .
Therefore , I expect refunding my full amount $ 180 as soon as possible .
Not only do I have a big nuclear family who is made up by four siblings , but I also have a big extended family .
Besides as I am the eldest brother , I am used to dealing with children .
Regarding my experience , on the one hand , I take part in a soccer club in university , consequently , I have some experience working in a team .
On the other hand , I have just finished my first year in Physical Education degree , where we played a lot of different sports .
It is true , that water sports are not the most usual there , however , I enjoy practising them every summer on the beach .
I feel I would be the person you are looking for because I am patient and alert .
These are the most important skills when you deal with children , due to de fact that you ought to keep on the lookout for their behaviour .
Moreover , from my point of view , children need to focus their attention in a constant activity , my sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to maintain their attention .
If you offer me the chance to join your team , you shall not be disappointed .
Those days , travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people .
This kind of transport is regarded as a covenient way .
Government build more roads and more families are able to afford cars .
However , I disgree with this idea .
Instead , I suppose that public transport will play an essential part in future life .
There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to explain .
On one hand , it is enviornmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars .
Nowadays , buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in urban cities .
They produce no gas to the air , leading to little air pollution .
In the meanwhile , if people prefer to take buses or subways , there will be less noises in the street .
On the other hand , buses and subways can accommodate more passengers while a car can only contains 4 to 5 people totally .
Compared with cars , public transport has larger capability of conveying , which saves space and costs less .
Last but not least , fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
In conclusion , public transport is a cost - effective way for people to travel , which also contributes to the sustainable development of society .
The statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort on fields or subjects that they are not good at , which I can not agree with .
This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of escape .
The responsibility of education institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions , not making decisions for students .
Among various purposes of education , in my opinions , the most important one is teaching students to solve problems .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreating , all these are the main reason why the humankinds can keep improving .
Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education .
If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance to be successful , we 'll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein , who were considered as stupid kids in school but did n't give up trying .
One may suggest that everyone need to learn to assess the risk before invest , however , teaching students how to assess not assessing for students is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Truly that knowing one 's limit is the first step of bringing out the maximum value of one 's talent .
It 's not smart to encourage people doing what exceed their ability .
Nevertheless , the ability of identifying limit of oneself can be best learned from experiences .
The responsibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him / her from getting close to the water .
Educational institutions should guide students to have better self - understanding and self - assessing , not persuading them to follow the pre - decided road .
What if a student would rather to do something he / she likes instead of he / she is good at ?
Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with , such as wealthy , fame or power .
For some people , living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the top , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such situation they can provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein has said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions .
In my opinions , the purpose of the education is to teach and guide students how to facing the problems and making their own decision properly , not force them to accept what have already been arranged for them .
The most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme " Tagesschau " which is airing about three times a day on the channel " Das Erste / ARD " .
It is a news programme based on well researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need .
Every now and then they even air an extra reportage on a certain field like the European election or the crisis in the Ukraine .
The main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research which makes it more reliable than other news programmes .
Moreover they try to be interesting for all ages so they post on facebook and twitter as well which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme .
Nevertheless they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and in addition they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need .
In my personal opinion I strongly believe that this TV programme earns its popularity .
The way they present themselves in the media and the well funded research are truly unique in German news programmes .
Although I am rarely watching the show on TV I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring nes so vivid interesting through short video clips , pictures and their choice of words .
If you ever get to watch TV in Germany you should definitely try out this interesting news programme .
Do you get along with your superior ?
Last summer I finally managed to change my boring job and that tiny clothes job for a better one .
We 'd get there at about half past eight every day and started cleaning the main room and proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema .
It was a lot of fun mainly because it was just us two .
We 'd make jokes and chase each other with the brooms , trying to smack the other on the head .
The main advantage of working at the local cinema was the free popcorn and getting to enjoy the newest films .
My job was cleaning the cinema , but Fred 's main responsibility was to roll the movies for the clients , so I 'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier , so I could enjoy watching movies with him .
For last ten years Michael had been working in a well - known company in London as an accountant .
He did like his job but as we all know , sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something .
One day he woke up much earlier than used to .
He prepared a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news .
He sat on a sofa in front of a television and suddenly he realised the fact that every morning was exactly the same , nothing has changed since such many years ! "
I wo n't stand it any longer " - he thought .
Since Michael was a child he has always dreamt of moving to Australia , where he could practise kitesurfing for all day long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sandy beach and drink a good Australian alcohol .
At that moment he was pretty sure what to do now .
After 10 minutes a resignation letter was ready to bring it to Michael 's boss .
He arrived on the company as quickly as the crowded London 's streets allowed him .
" I need to talk to boss " - he said to Jane , the main secretary of the company .
Without waiting for her answer , he just went into the office , gave to Mike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with a resignation letter and left .
Sometimes we do things we do n't want for no apparent reason but some other times we know exactly where we are getting into .
There was no way to shine a different light to that fact .
He could not keep his betrayal inside any longer so he entered the living room and told her .
The words coming up from his mouth like a litany , almost mechanically as he realized that there was no turning back .
The relieve of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness .
He did n't do it for her , he only did it for himself , to get rid of his burden but it was far too late .
Glitz , glamour and popularity ; three words which are often linked to the world of football and this sport in no doubt one of the finest that man has created .
The 90 minutes is the most enjoyed time of the week though because of the adrenalin rush that is associated with every thing that is done on the pitch .
As a fan supporting a team is just one part of the sport .
Rivalries , arguments on which team is the better team and watching matches in a group just adds to the excitement .
With regard to this sport any advice in my opinion is a good advice and I have just a single advice for a person starting this sport and that advice would be to enjoy everything related to the sport .
Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until go to university , even some of them still need to study them in the university .
A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled in mathematics .
This essay will discuss the differences and similarities for learning a language and learning mathematics .
For studying a language , people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read variety of overseas book to increase their reading and writing skills .
In general , studying a language focuses more on a large account of individual effort and little talent .
However , for learning mathematics , students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions . Instead of rote learning , they should remember different types of formulas by practicing in a mass of examples .
However , there are some similarities for those two subjects .
Firstly , both those courses need to do a mass of practices , even the ways are different .
People need to spend a huge account of time on doing exercise after class .
For example , when people learn a new word or a formula , they need to think about how to use it in real sentence or exercises .
In conclusion , people need to find a right way which can save much time and energy to study these two subjects .
It is the most important thing that they should think about carefully before they start their study .
However , the young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance .
A feminine gay man is considered as lesser than his masculine counterpart , because femininity is regarded as weak , unattractive , and second - class .
She chose little , cosy restaurant near her house .
She did not suspect that it will be such a wonderful evening .
As soon as Anna and her friends came into restaurant everything started to go perfect .
Then all got special clothes and dressed up in colourful , old - fashined dresses .
She said to friends : ' This is best party ever !
She started to dance with double Presley , laugh and appreciate every single minute .
As it turned out later , to Anna 's surprise , it was her boyfriend dressed as Presley .
But immediately she realize that it was one of her friends ' tricky plan and she started to laugh with them .
After a few exciting hours of the party she said thank you to her friends and boyfriend and promised she will never forget what they did for her .
She went to sleep with belief that she is the happiest girl in the world .
Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kinddom in my country .
The Catholic Monarchs , Isabella and Ferdinad , had tried for several years to defeat the muslims , who at this time , only remained seated in the city of Granada .
Its surroundings are also wonderful , and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra , one of the last Muslim palaces in the word .
I haven't seen you for almost two months but , as you know , on November I had a one of a kind possibility to help at a concert that took place on airport runway and it was simply amazing experience !
I 'm sure you do know that I 'm obsessed with rock music and that is why I could n't miss the boat .
An event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal !
People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to kill their every single ' rival ' .
Security guards had a lot of work to do but thanks to them we stand a chance to deal with other problems , as for example regulating the quality of sound .
A band was playing , we were enjoying music and it seemed that there will be no more complications .
What you actually think in such an extraordinary moment is that life could n't be more beautiful .
just a quick answer to your request .
So , the deal is , I met this guy in the bar , Ron , and we started talking .
After a few drinks I told him that I 'm currenly looking for a job , nothing big , just a couple of hours during weekends to gather some money for my journey to Netherlands .
It 's literally 10 - 15 hours on Fridays nights and Saturdays , stuff like carrying instruments ( which means hanging out with musicians ) , tyding after ( finding things , like wallets and cellphones ) and generally speaking - helping .
Last week I worked most time with the manager of The Kooks .
In fact I had to be everywhere with the guy , just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city .
He 's a really nice guy , during the concert we had a few drinks , smoked some fags together .
Usually I get 12 PLN per hour ( yeah , I know , It 's like 2,50 pounds , but here it 's quite good ) but sometimes I get some extra money for staying after hours or when I do something unusual to help .
Last time it was for example delivering my drunk boss home ;)
Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I 'll tell you so much more , I have plenty of unbelievable stories !
I 'm a chemist I ca n't kill people becasue I wanted to .
The police was gon na come in any time .
He grabbed the body and put it on the car 's trunk .
His partner said : Man , we have to do something and quick .
They grabbed the body and soaked him on fuel .
Later , when they were sure that there were no one near they burned the car .
The killers partner felt guilty for a moment but then the killer told him : ' He earned it .
Saddly the police found out that it was them .
Thanks that the judge 's best friend had been killed by the man the chemist killed so they went out free and without bad feeling .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them striving to put everything in a broader perspective .
However , their whole lives will be turned upside down when an elegible bachelor and his friends set up home in a close mansion .
All in all , will each one be able to overcome their own pride and prejudice ?
In fact , the film , well cast from top to bottom , is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a set of beautiful English locations , as in many British productions .
Therefore dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure , several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings , and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story
I am 45 years old man and I have plenty of experience in working with people .
I used to work with young people in primary and secondary schools teaching Spanish language .
Although I still have not passed the FCE exam I am currently working hard to fulfil the goal very soon .
Above all I am interested in films .
Science fiction are my favourite type of films because I like to leave behind normal life nevertheless , I enjoy all kinds of them such as comedies , thrillers , westerns , horror films and even silent films .
I think I am right for the position because I think I can boost the motivation of the people about movies and push them up to share their particular point of view .
As far as the job is concern working on Monday and Wednesday evening would be perfect for me because I am currently unemployed .
Our club members are thrilled knowing that an international sports star like you is coming to see them .
In reference to the speech date , the best would be June 12 in the evening , when all the members will have finished their classes at school .
What about talking about fair play at sport and how to become a sports star ?
We believe that fair play is a very important topic because children must learn to behave properly when playing a sport .
Also , we think that becoming a sports star is difficult and it would be a good idea to talk about it because some of the club members wrongly think it is easy to succeed playing a sport .
Some of these thoughts make us smile , some frown .
I have written many poems , few articles and even a few stories .
It is certainly a pleasure to write and also reading what I have written , after a long time .
Many times reading my own poems and articles is a surprising experience . "
" I ask myself , wondering how did I come up with some ideas and words that seem just so good and uncommon right now .
Other than myself , I have had few people reading what I have written ; very few , I must say ; maybe only 2 or 3 ; and they were not critics or experts .
So , I have yet to submit myself to some serious criticism ( well , calling my writings literature is a huge joke in itself ... anyway ) ; but yes , I would like to place my written works ( however small and few they may be)for qualitative discussions in front of people who really can identify the good and the ' not - so - good ' writing .
I would like getting good advice about how can I make myself a better writer .
Do we know what does it mean to be a friend ?
Firstly we ought to consider that friendship is not uniquely a human emotion .
Friendship is overall an acto of will .
Friendship is a type of love which is characterized by being incondicional , reciprocal , and ready to forgive each other .
A friend is a treasure , as the title of that adventure - comedy film , somebody you can share your problems with .
Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes , your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them , your plans for the future , and moreover pays special attention on times of crisis .
Finally , they warn me of danger but they let me do , even if in the end I 'd make a big mistake . They 'd keep always close to me and neither would fail .
They feel happy when I am happy , they are sad when I am sad , they enjoy themselves with my success .
Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself , while many also place a lot mystic connections with this painting .
The portrait depicts a woman 's bust , with a distant landscape that is visible in the backdrop .
Leonardo used a pyramid design to install the woman in a simple and calm manner within the painting .
The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes on the painting are made visible through it .
Some winding paths and a far away bridge is also perceptible in the background .
Without the interference of the government , criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users .
However , if the government were to monitor the citizens actions more closely , it would be considered an invasion of our privacy .
Nobody wants to have their private data to be exposed to the eyes of the government .
That way , the most of the trouble would be kept away from the internet while at the same time , the internet users would still have the freedom to explore the web .
Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders .
This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
Regarding personal skills , there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood .
According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
Likewise , some people put their success in life down more to their parent 's training than to their innate talents .
So , to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are .
The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case .
Your new friends seem to be crazy guys , in a good way , of course .
As I 've got some extra money at last , I think It 's high time for me to think how to make it cozy and comfortable .
First , I think about painting the walls in warm colors ( apricot , salmon or warm beige ) . I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list .
Do you think a wall mural is a good decision for the bedroom and what other « special effects » would you recommend ?
I completely rely on your taste as we 've always been on the same wavelength .
Now , the toughest questions . I 've got no clue what to do with the ceiling .
I hope I do n't bother you too much with my redecoration , knowing how busy you are .
CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT
We do that for work or to finally get a rest .
I , as a young women , usually travel just as a hobby .
Since the technology has improved in recent years , we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel .
The most common answer would be probably the plane .
Travelling on a boat for sure is a great adventure .
In my country trains are n't really fast and there could be problems during the trip but that 's for me makes it more interesting .
During the trip you can do many things - from sleeping to meeting new people and making fun .
It is also quite safe so you do n't have to worry about the accidents .
The trip is an adventure and the ways you can travel are a big part of it .
back in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a course that took 18 hours driving straight , surely very few people would consider it convenient .
cars are handy and driving can be pleasant , but only when the driver is in good mood , with no traffic jams or craters on the road ( really common situations in Brazil ) .
Since ancient times exist public transport , and it suffered numerous attempts of assassination , in China for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that age , charriots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against mongol 's dictatorship in it ; the situation inverted at early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars as instrument of opression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
we have cars so we do n't have to walk , in the same fashion , people who ca n't afford a car will want public transport , even if a bike could be the solution .
The convenience has litlle to do with the fate of public transport , countries with high HDI(convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport system , and they are even boosting it .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and change us to some labor - lovers , personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity .
Hi ! My name is Alexia , I am twenty - three years old and I live in Argetina .
I have been learning English for a while , I am sensitive and positive person , full of energy and willing to have new adventures .
I have experience at taking care of children and it is a task that I really enjoy .
What I fancy the most of being with young children is the energy that they have and how innocent and peaceful the can be .
I think I might be a suitable person for the job because I have already work with kids , especially at teaching and having fun .
As I have alrealdy said , I play sports that is why I could be helpful at organizing sports and evening activities .
And last but no least , I am an excellent cooker .
I learned how to cook when I was eight , so I am pretty much confidente and well prepared .
Actually , my family is huge so I can cook big amounts of food with my own recipes which are tasty and quickly in order to feed all the kids in a glimpse .
If you get to hire me you wouln't regret it .
Yours Faithfully , Alexia .
The process can be divided into three sections .
Then it comes to the preparation of metal plates and that needs skilled machinists .
Only after all the work above is completed , can printing step be carried out .
Besides , The images can be slightly raised .
After printing , there is much more work to be done .
The most important step is inspection manually .
After that , good quality sheets and bank notes separated from partially damaged sheets will be packaged and distributed .
Bad sheets and bank notes will be securely destroed .
There are near to France and Andorra .
There are lots of ski stations with good ski slopes of different levels with different colours , the greens are the easiest and blacks are the most difficult .
When there is n't any race you can go and try different racing cars or if you want you can go and race a bike on the race track .
To sum up I think that if you want to do exciting sports Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do , but if you do n't want to do sports you can do another activities or go on interesting places .
Michael tried the cream and thought that her mother would n't notice it if he ate another bit . '
That night the time flew by , but things started to get weird , Marcus was talking with an Australian guy about the proofs that he had found related to dinosaurs , he was interested in them , but Marcus did n't like his point of view about those species , the guy told him they were bad creatures with no feelings , and Marcus thought they were awesome and the most lovely creatures he had never heard about , the guy thought Marcus was crazy , so he flew from the Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies , they were beautiful and flawless , the scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing , and suddenly the ladies vanished , the men started crying .
Jack , was arguing with an officer about Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't understand anything because Jack was drunk ) , and suddenly , the officer took off his costume and a strange mask , and in that moment … Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer , he was Brad !
Jack tried to confront him , but as soon as he tried to do that , he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him , he had a new team , he decided to name them " The KM-3J " , a villains team , their names were Karolina ( she decided to change his name like that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one ) , Melanie , Miley ( they were both twins , the most beautiful ladies of the world ) , Max , who was an expert in the military field , and Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known his last name until that moment : Junior , he was embarrassed about it , he was descendant of a weird woman , however she was her mother .
The KM-3J put Jack into an immense bag , they were planning to kill him and place his dead body in a grave , in that way their friends would find him buried , but they were not that evil , they just put him into a dark room and tied his hands in a chair , it was exactly the same thing he was dreamed about .
While Jack was there , he heard Brad talking with Max about their new plan , it was related to a gigantic weapon that would shoot toxic wastes at New York city , so in that way , everybody would become a zombie .
The bulk of the population from New York was homeless because there has just been a horrible war between New York City and California , however , increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war .
Jack was frightened , but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him , they had used some weapons from The King of the Sky , they got into the room and started shooting while Michael was unleashing Jack from the chair , accidentally , Mark killed Miley while he was shooting , all her body parts were scattered on the floor , he did n't care about and flew with the others .
When they arrived at mainland , Jack woke up , there was n't anyone around him , there was just sand and the beach …
Hence , it is not possible to do job and study side by side .
Occupation and education disturb one another .
I will elaborate points to support my opinion in the further paragraphs .
Firstly , there are a lot of people in western countries , who do a part - time study and work full - time or vice - versa .
This not only makes them knowledgeable but increase their potential as well .
Secondly , there are a few parents who can not bear the expenses of their child 's education .
Resultantly , they put their children into some labor so that they can earn money for the family .
But it does not mean that the child has to abandon his dream of acquiring education .
Finally , sometimes people think they have completed their education , but when they get a full - time job , they realize that diploma or degree can increase their chances of promotion .
I write to you to express my interest to apply for the weekend worker job that was posted on your cafe door .
I believe I am a good fit for this task since I had previous experience working in similar jobs .
I demonstrated courteous and professional attitude and achieved a high rating in the customer satisfaction survey .
Moreover , I have education in the field of customer service since I finished a customer service training course at George White College .
I am also a quick learner and adapt to different working environments .
Duped , so to say , into this unlikely event , a date night .
Was it the party which lasted until 3 am the night before ?
Was it at the invitation to the wedding three weeks ago ?
How far back could it possibly go .
So many twists and turns - she played her cards well , I never suspected while sitting in the pews next to my wife that when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face that the evening would end at D'el Arte .
Nor when her condition appeared to worsen and I decided to go get the car to take her to the doctor 's office , nor when I returned to find her lying on the cold hard stone floor of the church could I have ever imagined we would be enjoying a quiet evening together sharing entrees and desserts .
Nor could I have conceived after having multiple people help calling the ambulance , which never came , or the friends who called my in - laws to come take care of the kids , that we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evening .
No , none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the test for something more serious were all negative .
I 'm writing as an answer for an advertisement for a job in the USA .
I think I would be fit for this job , because I am young , energetic , enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children .
I can speak English since I used to vacation in Australia as a child .
I grew up with two younger brothers and used to look after them therefore I am used to dealing with younger kids .
In my opinion this job would be a great , helpful experience .
I 'm Antonio Trevisano del Bruno , an Italian 15-year - old teenager , and I have studied English since I was 7 .
I am a really sporty person and I think I would be the person who you are looking for because I 'm really capable and patient with children .
So , I do n't find difficult to organize competitions or activities for children .
I 'm a really cheerful person and , though I am 15 , I 'm keeping up with the kids ' world .
Yours sincerely
My goal I decided then , was to become a pilot when I grewn up .
Suddenly my plane began to act up , I was losing control .
I looked at the plane and realized I forgot to tie the parachute cord to the plane .
Thank God I did n't jumped or I would have been a ' dead duck ' for sure !
My mom has a kindergarden and I love helping her out .
Every summer I help my mom 's summer camp , but it 's a summer camp of babies and I would like to work wth older children because I think it 's more challenging . I would love to work at any placeacross th US .
I am very good at artistic things , such as , drwaing , paining , cooking , dancing and a lot of other things .
I hope to get this job because I have been waning it for a very long time .
I would be very hap to get it .
Last month , as you may know , I was a volunteer on occasion of my favourite band 's concert in Katowice .
It was just a miracle - it had turned out that the band 's manager was my good old friend Daniel and he asked me for help when he found out I was a big fan of the group .
At first I had to be involved in it a month before the event was started .
I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs , restaurants etc .
so I was handing leaflets everywhere .
By the time the event was upcoming , I had to take over the band 's equipment .
I had to move it from place to place along with boys from the group .
One thing leads to another and we ended up having a beer and laughing in a pub .
Eventually the concert came off just perfectly !
If you will ever have an opportunity to help by this kind of event , I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart !
I 'm very happy to hear from you since both have been quite busy these days with the exams .
You have always wanted to be policewoman ( unless you have recently changed your opinion ) so you must be very fit since you need to pass the physical tests , which are very demanding , according to my mother .
Sport is something essential to get this goal and you can always practise music at home when you have some free time ( yes , I know that it happens once in a month ) .
Moreover , you wrote to me that you have started to give lessons about guitar so you are not going to be isolated from music and it goes on playing an important role in your life .
So I think you should n't be upset because now it is a difficult period , I know , but it passes and we can get back our life when we go to university .
My cousin , who is studying English Literatura , told me that you have much more freedom when you start university , so do n't worry !
I hope you write to me when you make the final decision , I look forward to hearing from you .
He can remember his name , Thomas , but that 's all he can remember : everything importanthas been wiped clean .
Lnguage itself also becomes vitally important : the boy 's speech is peppered with made - up words that highlight the isolation .
The book ends devastating final twist .
The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy . I should be able to describe my view of American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult , a woman , a wife , a mother and simply a human being with various roles in life who has been million times happy and million times unhappy .
No . I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time , but it is impossible to write the truth since I have never seen him alive . I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life , experience and surrounding I live in .
Let me introduce one American I got friends with on Facebook .
I like his humor , because he is able to make me smile .
His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences .
I adore his imagination because he is able to kidnap you on a cloud to a never never land .
He is wise and brave , because he was not scared to teach me although he is not a teacher .
He is the man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo , love is just a quote and lying is the new truth .
He is the man and I am the woman who live in the world , in which the man wears a short skirt and the woman is as tough as a crocodile .
How come !
I would like to point out another his attribute which is his pride .
When I asked him , if he had read a book The Little Prince by Exupéry because I am feeling like a fox , he asked me in an offended manner , if I know Larry , the comedian .
Kyle is really prideful , but so are all the men .
I do n't believe in the friendship between the man and the woman .
There will always be some kind of sparkling either alluring or repulsing .
Next thing I like about him is that he never pushes me into anything .
So he is thoughtful .
He rose up my own enslaved desires .
All the men are .
In following section I will write about his sexuality and dealing with an argument .
It was easy to draw him into the love affair or to make him horny , but it was quite difficult to start an argument with him . I think that he is a good writer because he is able to describe his sexual dreams and thoughts lively and vividly .
However , ask him a question from his real life and he will give you a one - word answer .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily journal .
I believe he is tender and careful , but impatient and clumsy at the same time .
He forgets of everything when he plunges into his Neverland .
As I wrote before it was not that easy to make the argument with him .
I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue , for example : You are totally uninterested to read between lines ! You never listen to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum .
Yesterday I wanted him to tell me the story of his life .
So I asked him what his favourite sport is .
He actively does hiking , hunting and camp riding .
Kyle is a strong and charismatic individuality and he values his privacy a lot .
And surely , I will .
However , I am not that crazy to marry the man whom I not know in real life .
But I identify myself with his view of male and female relationship .
Yellow the female principle , gentle , cheerful and sensual .
As requested , this is a report concerning the environmental condition within my town .
The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population 's interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area .
Through a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling .
Since exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays , the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport , in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community , thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society .
Our local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal , storage , collection and transport of waste material , but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit .
Taking everything into consideration , it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside .
However , as with all issues present within society , a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor .
If we disturb a fire ant nest they would relentlessly sting us , injecting poison into our body .
Even if we do n't , stinging will cause a burning sensation , swelling and then a blister at the point of sting .
In mild cases , the sting causes itch .
In severe cases it causes nausea , vomiting or dizziness .
In infested areas , they injure livestock , pets and wildlife ; damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , and irrigation systems .
here will be several inventions in the next years .
Moreover , it is a profitable task if they make up new medications to help people suffering from that illness .
It does not fit in rich countries because it concerns to poor countries .
Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding of one person in one day .
I consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely end with the most unfair problem of this world .
There must be something very special about a movie when , after the third time , you 're still getting out of the cimena thinking " I have to see it again " .
Starring Italian comic Roberto Begnini ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) in the main role of Guido , this live loving tragic / comedy it 's about a Jewish father trying to shield his young son from the horrors of the nazims in the Italy of Mussolini .
For that matter Guido creates an imaginariy game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .
He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win a tank , so the little Guiosué did n't realise what it 's really going on around him .
The strength of the movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccentric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his ability as director to deal with such delicate topic like Nazism while managing to drive through a thick line bettween comedy and drama .
The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , delicate plus to this masterpiece .
Life is beautiful was recipient of numerous awards including three Oscars as for best foreign picture , best actor and best original dramatic score .
What strikes me more was that despite the fact that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , the film is n't really about the holocaust but a bittersweet fable about human courage love and hope .
If you already haven't seen it , which I doubt , I highly recommend it ; it will make you laugh out loud but also along the way you 'll find yourself cover in tears , Guarantee .
When I joined the team freshman year , I did n't realize what I was getting into .
See , football is more of a mental sport than anything else , so running on the track was n't only about getting in shape . We would push our minds by running as hard as we could even if we felt like we were going to pass out .
Then after the third game I had a season - ending injury .
Needless to say , I was sidelined for the rest of the season , but this actually helped me realize that since you never know when your last play will be , you should try your hardest in football and life .
After freshman year I decided that I would always give my best effort .
Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular play or how to block . I have learned to think about others first , and realized how important working hard is .
The answer , of course , is no , because you can always put it in another gear even if you think you need to give up .
Honestly , I could not agree more , as the website as it is available today is an inconvenient tool providing insufficient informaton .
Second , the theme is outdated , and developing new design can be a good move to attract more clients .
As to other aspects of our website , it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements ( which decrease the website value while bringing little profit ) .
All these tasks can be completed within a month , and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website , as it is an important aspect of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key when attracting clients is concerned .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge .
I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary .
So , the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure .
Moreover , they should comprise the past information and the new one .
In other words , technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .
This new technologies also help in the teaching development .
We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools , in the case of subjects such as English and French , students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries .
Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great teacher said , we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there must not be a technological revolution but an educational one .
I am writing to express my concern about the smoking ban new law .
At present , I am working for Cafe Noir , a well - known restaurant popular with visitors , many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced , they would would not enter into restaurants and instead , they would meet friends at home .
On top that , I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable .
There needs to be much wider public debate , and if a majority agree , they should be given enough time to get used to .
There were not enough police to go round checking any public place .
Secondly , business suffered , with people objecting that they should be given the right to smoke if they wished .
We will talk about a technology that might soon disturb the world .
But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything .
The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing then producing then consuming .
For a quick glimpse , this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object .
More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
In other words , money would have more value .
So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
You then could pay your debt , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
Looking at it through a broader scope , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would get accommodated .
This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
Surprisingly , the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produce at better quality too .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world .
Dogs and cats are called " furkid " not only because their bodies are covered with fur , but also because their hosts regard pets as kids .
I can still recall the day Cathy and I brought Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
He changed my attitude toward dogs : Casino taught me through his patience and passions .
Ever since I met him , I stopped feeling frighten when facing big dogs , and even started to play with them .

Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I am interested in applying for the job vacancy in the Cafe you run .
The reason for applying is that I believe I would be a perfect candidate as I have plenty of experience in the food business as well as I am highly interested in working for this well - known company .
I strongly believe I would be the right person for the post as I consider myself as polite , well - mannered , enthusiastic and good at dealing with customers .
Besides , working in popular restaurants enabled me to gain the ability to work as part of a team and under pressure , plus learning about a wide variety of international food and dishes .
What is more , I am used to working long hours in both day and night shifts , so busy days will not be a problem for me at all .
Finally , I would like to express my willingness in working for you as this will represent such a great experience for me .
Regarding my level of English , I speak fluent English and got an A on the Cambridge First Certificate Exam .
I also have been helping a nine years old kid with his math homework .
I also love playing sports , such as tennis , soccer , canoeing and kayaking .
I always try so hard to not to go to new restaurants because I do n't like most of them at first .
It was my brother 's birthday so he said if we could go to a new restaurant called Muerde La Pasta .
I 've always Heard about that place so I though it would be okay to go .
It 's a free buffet so you can take everything you want … there are chips , pizza , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and there 's no food limit haha .
The staff is so good , they are really helpful and they are always looking if you 've finished to take the dirty dishes away .
Honestly , I thought I would n't like the restaurant but I was completely wrong .. I loved it !
I 'm going with my Friends next week!!I think you get more tan what you pay for like its unlimited food and you only have to pay 10 Euros .
If you did n't go yet , you should definetly do it , I promise you will love it !
You can never really say a thing is worst unless you have indulged yourself in it .
You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been to it .
And you can never really say a teacher in the mountain is miserable unless you have experienced being one .
When I knew I would be assigned at Gala National High School , I said it 's the worst thing that ever happened to my career .
When I knew I would be teaching at the remotest high school in Ozamiz , I said I was so unfortunate , and when I knew I would be spending my days in the mountain , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes filled my thoughts after having known that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most .
But after a year , I was all wrong .
To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation ; I have never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
In fact , being a teacher in the mountain is being the best of who I am , being the most fortunate of men alive , and being the happiest I could ever be .
In here , I have learned more than the lessons I have taught .
It has taught me lessons I could n't have learned had I not been here - the lessons that do not only help me improve my teaching profession but also help me become the right person of my ministry .
I may have been far yet from being an ideal one , but I know someday , having Gala as my guiding light , I can become one .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who most of the time shares the same line of interest with me .
We are so small a number , but that does not hinder us to hold any school program and activity at its best .
With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm , we always made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never settled for any mediocrity .
Together , we aspire for something beyond better .
It 's not all the time that we are in good terms , but we know to ourselves that we care for each other .
And it 's all that matters .
At first , it was an extreme challenge for me to handle students in the mountain .
Every day I got to deal with students wearing different faces of life 's resentment .
As a teacher , it took me much of everything I have to come to terms to every pitiful fate of my students .
Hence , the value of UNDERSTANDING the students even beyond what the meaning of such word can express has been dramatically instilled in me .
And that 's one of the lessons I consider a gem to keep to myself forever .
Students in the mountain have a lot of different untold stories of their lives .
These stories once heard , can open somebody 's heart to learn to love learners despite everything .
That is what exactly happened to me .
As I listened to my students , I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as their teacher .
I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities , but I know somehow in my one year stay in Gala , I have made a difference to my students ' lives .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life , but seeing them enduring was motivating me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on .
My dear students may have not known it , but really , they are too the source of my inner strength .
I have more than enough reason to do that - and they are again , my students .
In a nutshell , Gala may have been very far , yet it my heart , it 's just within .
The place , my colleagues , and my dear students are enough testimonies that in Gala I have found a home … and a family to love , really for real .
I am writing to you regarding a job advertisement I saw on yesterday 's newspaper looking for an English - speaking person to work at weekends in your cafe .
I like trying dishes from all over the world and I am keen on cooking experimenting new exotic cuisine .
As a consequence I am prepared to work long hours .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Sir :
It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certification .
Similarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms to learn English .
Next I started to read books such as the Harry Potter series and books by George R. R. Martin .
These are my study methods , if I can say so .
About the reasons to take the test , there is little to say .
As I have said , I have been learning English by the sheer pleasure of it ; but , having come this far , I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition about my level .
Lots of people think , that teenagers are stupid , have a small knowledge about life , do not have enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understand .
In my opinion we should n't think like that .
I agree that some of young people behave really badly , they smoke , shout on their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
But most of teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or erderly people .
At school , at home they have to cope with lots of problems and try to solve them .
They sometimes have to help their friends or even their parents in difficult tasks like psychical problems , give them tips .
Sometimes it happens that a couple , which has a child in age from 12 - 16 , querls .
Tennagers also have to make serious decisions like choosing secondary school , future job , which way they will go in their life , if they want to be in relationship with someone .
This way you do not only gather plain data but also emotions from people .
Additionally , it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator 's mind .
This is an impressive way to document a change over many years , but on the other hand it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition .
For me personally , the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way because of three reasons : Firstly , I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person but maybe two or three more .
Secondly , I can catch the the narrator'semotions .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concerned about loss of qualitiy of photographs and pictures .
When I was in Bali , I had a great night that I always remember .
My husband and me went to a dinner on the beach of our hotel .
The weather was very good and we enjoyed having dinner barefoot , sat on the sand .
When we thouhgt that the night had finished , we had the perfect dessert .
Despite it was very dark , we could see something moving on the sand .
It was lost and could n't find the way to the water .
They turned the turtle and took it to the water , where freed it .
Then the turtle started swimming and disappeared of our sight .
We were very happy because of seeing the turtle and hope to come back to Bali to see it again .
Visiting their own country certainly has its advantages .
In addition , if you plan your vacation very soon , you can also save money on planes or hotels .
In conclusion , I think it 's important to know both their own countries and foreign lands .
It was in August , my parents and my brother were on holiday in Mallorca for a week , and that same day my sister and her boyfriend travelled from Yecla to Paris in a package travel .
At that moment I thought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family but fortunately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other side of the phone and she told me that my sister and her boyfriend were n't with the other passengers .
It is a fantastic film with beautiful views and an exciting story .
The main character , Walter Mitty , works in a well - known magazine " Life " as a manager of photo negatives .
In his letter he says that one shot from the film is the best picture he has ever made .
Unfortunately , Walter can not find the shot , so he has to look for the traveller which is not easy .
He has to travel to remote parts of the world and have some very amazing adventures .
I wo n't tell you any more as it can spoil the story , but the film is definitely worth watching .
In addition , I can say that I 'm charmed by the main character who is developing throughout the whole film .
If you like complicated stories about dreams and how to make them true , this story is definitely for you .
Free of pocket pain & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Gorica .
You will find there a parking area and some ball courts , and on further exploration , just after the courts & walking towards that famous bridge that you can now see much better , a restaurant .
For seasonal food served by obliging & good humoured waiters , you will find nowhere better .
In summer that boiler of dark liquid beside the entrance might be Kopriva chai , a summer herbal digestif , favoured by the villagers of the region , or you might be offered a world war one menu such as soldiers may have eaten in this area .
Day , date and season dictate the ever interesting & changing menu at this restaurant .
The warm interior is the perfect place to eat in winter , while in summer , many diners prefer the exterior tables beside the turquoise Soca river .
One of Slovenia 's qualified somnelliers will help you choose from the good wine cellar , so this is the place where I recommend our class can relax , eat , drink well & enjoy the happy atmosphere .
The film is set in France in nineteenth century .
The idea lying behind the story is that justice and law are not the same thing .
The main character , Jean Valdjean , played by Hugh Jackman , is jailed for stealing a loaf of bread , in a try to avoid his nephew 's death .
Then after being left free , he become a thief again , however this time he is not condemned because of a prier .
But do not worry I am not going to spoil the ending .
All it occurs during the first part of the film .
All in all I think that it is one of the best films ever made .
Cars are improving , becoming safer and environment friendlier .
A lot of effort has been put into reducing the fumes , etc .
Moreover , people have become more aware of the environment protection .
Thus , more and more people , when buying a new car , also consider its environmental friendliness and the possible impact on the community .
Also , cars get more affordable in many countries .
For example , in India nd China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars , which are also imported .
However , there might be still room for public transport in future , especially in big cities .
Although I do n't quite like watching soap operas , I was started watching this particular show with my family .
My mother likes watching soap operas on tv and she got me hooked onto this new tv show - iknmp .
The show looked promising through its promos , which were based on a very famous old hindi song .
The lead actors were well known tv stars .
The couple have 4 kids and after separation , 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad .
The dad , who is a cardiologist moves to US and starts a new life there .
The mom on the other hand decides to stay back and works hard to give her children a decent life .
The show starts with the eldest daughter , who lives with her mother trying to contact her father to ask him to be a part of her wedding ceremony .
The father who had vowed to never look back at first ignores her requests , however , upon insistence from his other children and his sister agrees to go back to India .
Although not very practical , the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and at the same time teaches the importance of women being independent and able to lead life on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship can be perceived as a special process of creating , testing and implementing of the new products and materials , the new way of resource utilization and the new kind of management in business process to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first test has shown that I am very motivated and my skills almost fit to the possibility to be an entrepreneur .
It is important to underline that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine behaviour of entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting .
In the test were accessed the answers and I was found out as a person that has high control appeal meaning that I have great leading skills and a need to organize and to moderate .
In the motivation part I also received high score in need of challenges as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really important for me to be own boss even though it needs much more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in the test I received fewer points in " need for achievement / success " than it was required for being an entrepreneur .
As I found out there were two problems about lack of points .
The first one was based on profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test .
The above - mentioned situation means that during the assessment were not taken into account other goals that entrepreneur might have .
For instance , it can be the social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or an entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifestyle .
The second problem was based on essential role of getting a feedback .
However , the test evaluated as important feedback parents and friends opinion and I do not agree that it might be essential unless they are specialists in that field .
Nevertheless , I might take a reasonable risk in case it can positively influence business .
I 'm not going to spend a lot of money for a ticket , because I 'm studying so I just have a part - time job .
If we check the prices of air travel , we can be disappointed as well as of travel by boat .
Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper .
Plane flies very quickly , but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier .
Travelling by train is quite fast , and pleasant , I can safely travel to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport .
After the summary is to certify that travelling by train is the most advantageous , but the most important reason why I chose journey by train a fact that I have a motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At the end of a decade in which technology has made enormous leaps , I am thinking about how much present vision of house will change in the future .
Despite many differences in the human nature , the present houses do not differ so much between themselves .
On the other hand , recently , more often many new and more advanced projects are realized by daring architects .
But can you imagine that in the near , unspecified future all homes will be like that ?
Built by using the most modern technology , full of the latest inventions which man can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , but it would be useful to modern houses to be constructed so as to do not damage the environment .
I think quite few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the future will go beyond the limits of our imagination .
There has been major changes regarding the teaching approach in the last few years , but there is still room for improvement .
If we focus on the teaching of English as a foreign language , we possibly could see this more clearly .
In the early 1980s the activity in the classroom was focused on grammar .
However , speaking , listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays .
The new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have .
This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation .
There are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take responsibility , motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes .
It is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers , since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods .
In conclusion : The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain .
The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently .
However , a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education - related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years .
In the year 2020 there was conflict between Japan and the United states .
The conflict was due to trend creation , citizens between both countries wanted to see who created better and bigger trends .
Law enforcers also wanted for their country to win , and in the United States policemen arrested any Japanese person they saw and sent them back to Japan .
Once the day was over , the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damages done , but it was impossible .
Japan asked the United states for help , they gladly agreed , and they dragged Japan back up to their normal status .
Japan launched a counter attack and enslaved the United States , and then proceeded to conquer the world .
A new era was created , it was the most brutal time period in the history of mankind , it was known as many things most people named it " The Japan Era " , but it was so brutal that the official name was " The Dark Yellow Era "
I would like to recommend the following movie : " The perfume " .
This movie can be considered a classical thriller , but with several aspects that makes it unique in this gender .
First of all , the historical period is the victorian age in France .
Landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildings , dresses , and habits of population are displayed in full detail .
Secondly , we have and amazing script that can be considered unique .
The story tell us the importance of the perfume in all aspects of our lifes .
The movie 's main plot describes the early years of our starring , a poor orphan , which takes advantage of his powerful smell sense to find out new jobs .
Finally we will discover a fantastic ending that we would never imagine through the movie watching .
The overall rate of this movie is really high and it is a movie to remember forever .
Nevertheless this is not an all audiences movies , because it contains hard scenes not suitable for children .
If people can rent this movie or watch it online I would encourage watch it as fast as possible .
Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest future .
The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport .
Apart from that , there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day .
First of all , an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy .
For example , driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume .
If the car is large enough , it can be even a perfect place for sleep .
Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
Public transport can take us just to certain locations .
Thus , it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages .
On the other hand , we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car .
For instance , staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time .
It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones , therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people .
She opened her sleepy eyes , smiled gently and got up from her bed idly .
After that , she dressed up and went to the kitchen to make a breakfast .
After aeting delicious salad and drinking tea , she went to her room to do her hair and put the make - up on .
Anna was a bit stressed , but she was sure , that everything will be alright .
She came down and opened the door - it was her mother .
They hugged and smiled to each other .
She came in and noticed that her daughter is a little nervous , so she decided to make a coffee , sit and talk for a while .
As they were talking , Anna 's best friends came up .
After some time friends came down and told Anna 's mother , that she is ready and she is going to come in a while .
Her mum came to her and hugged her really affectionately . "
One also learns to work hard and disciplined in order to achieve success .
All these points led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I 'm still hooked by it .
If someone would ask me for advice on how to start playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a trial practise and if the person enjoys it , he / she can join the club .
Is situated in the city center , near the seaport .
It is a different kind of restaurant , because you can find not only the typical Spanish food , also dishes from different parts of the world .
What I like most of this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food , the flavor is fantastic , the food very tasty and carefully cooked .
You can enjoy original food , good quality on a budget .
On the other hand the surroundings are modern , the place is airy and cosy .
The waiters are very welcoming and informative so you feel very comfortable .
In my opinion the salad is the best option , with a big range of types from different countries .
Finally I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled .
Unfortunately we did n't get the chance to see each other that night .
During two hours I served drinks .
At the end of the evening I worked at the parking lot .
All in all a great experience ! You can rely on my help next year !

Canada is a nation built of citizen - soldiers .
His death shocked a nation .
I am aged 44 , of Austrian nationality , married and hold the Cambridge English Advanced certificate since last summer .
I am also experienced with children , having looked after my sister 's daughters aged 9 , 11 and 14 for years now .
Whenever possible I take the girls out for a swim or a ride on their bikes .
It is also a good idea to play badminton and minigolf with them .
Further , I worked as an au - pair in France and Canada , where I watched over 3 , respectively , 2 children .
I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience .
Sincerely yours ,
It 's a website which allow me to taste food from around the world without moving from my city , at the same time that you can speak different languages and meet new people .
The best thing about this web is that very easy to use .
First , you have to select the city New York , Barcelona , etc .
You can use this web if you are a tourist or just someone who wants to enjoy a dinner in your own city .
On the other hand , if you are a professional or an amateur chef , you 'll earn an extra money .
There 's nothing like share a meal with local people , it offers you the possibility to glean from someone who lives in the place .
The wedding of my niece was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
First of all , my mother , my children , my partner and I took the train in Zaragoza to go to Barcelona .
When we arrived in Barcelona we went by taxi to the hotel , which my brother had previously booked , and there we met with other relatives : my brother , his wife , my nephews and of course my niece ( the bride ) .
We all went together to have lunch to a nearby restaurant .
The marriage ceremony took place at a wonderful church , there were flowers everywhere , live music , three hundred guests and of course , the bride and the bridegroom , the most beautiful and happy couple I have ever seen as far as I can remember .
The party was held in a large garden near the bridegroom 's fathers ' house .
The dinner was a three main course meal which had been carefully chosen by the new couple .
The party continued with a splendid dancing until seven in the morning .
If you are wealthy , or you come from a family where your father can provide you with most of the things you want , I suggest going to college straight away will be a good idea .
Some of us are afraid to travel because of the newborn cases of ISIS .
Mass shooting , bombs , hacking into security system can happen any time , any day .
However , for those who really need to fork out money to pay college loans , it is best for them to take a year off and work part time at a cafe , or somewhere remotely interesting .
It is wise for them to find some time to save some money so they would not need to struggle during college .
However , some just want to have some fun , after years in high school , after so many years of break ups , after so many years of eating cafeteria food , it is time to find some enjoyable time with quality friends and with mouth - watering food .
In their minds , it is all about having fun but is it really what it is ?
What if they changed into some monster they can not suppress ?
One day in the post , I had an argument with a man who studied in the same university as me , and I challenged him to fight with me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .
After that he told the teacher who was responsible for that class , and called me into her room and asked me questions .
This story tells us that sometimes we can not control ourselves , but we should be alone and think positively or take a deep breath , and these will make us calm down .
Hi , my name is Priscila and I just realized that I am a writer , too .
That was the first time my work was assessed by the way I wrote in English .
Because of my work , I have to write all the time to my students , to my colleagues and to the academic community in general .
I expect that this course will help me develop my English skills , so that I can write my papers , communicate and discuss my research in more effective way .
In modern world , public transport become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient . Travelling by car also reduces their time of journey and they do n't need to wait for a particular bus .
It may also because as people are getting richer they do n't need to go for a public transport as more comfortable option is always there waiting for them .
The world is moving faster and everyone has to be fast enough to compete with this modern world .
While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with modernized vehicles , public transport may not seems to be a better choice .
Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive , it does not stop people from using cars since convenience matters to them the most and not money .
Many people think that public transport is only for poor and not for rich .
If it continues , no resource will be spared for the future generation .
Nowadays , many people around the globe are trying to acquire a second language , when it comes to decide between learning in our own country versus learning abroad , we can find several pros and cons that might get us fairly confused .
To sum up , the best way of learning English , or rather the best place to do it depends on each person 's means and learning style , but definitely it is possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad .
People try to skip Good Friday because , there is no feasts in that day .
Moreover , it is the sombrest day in a year , which recalls people the Crucifixion caused by people 's sins .
People prefer to meet happiness and positive thinking then talking about a death and a suffering .
Accordingly , the author compares the Easter to a pagan spring festival , where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christians 's cheerfulness of the Resurrection .
People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about a death , a suffering and a self - sacrifice .
Everyone is individual and worries about themselves , because it is easier way to live .
Above all , people are not used to undergo suffering and what is more brutal death .
4 . The author mentions the origin of the word ' compassion ' , in order to remind people the meaning of that word .
It refers to ' suffer with ' .
Nevertheless , people make this compassion tided away , because it is too painful for them to stand that .
Not only they run away from uncomfortable situations but they also prefer to see them on screens .
My school friends and me went to Dominican Republic , it 's a Caribbean country with amazing beaches .
I remember we got there the first of October on a Saturday night , and I will never forget the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the plane .
When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms . I was sharing a room with my friend Emily .
After unpacking we left our room to see the rest of the resort .
Since Television was first invented , it has influenced different aspects of people 's lives .
Since Television was launched to the market it has acquired other purposes besides entertaining , such as communicating and advertising , that is way the possibility of it having educational purposes has been widely discussed .
Television can certainly educate , it has great potential for doing so because of the way it presents information and the scope of people it can achieve .
Television can educate in several ways , to mention some : by providing and extending information given in certain curses at school , and by providing information that is not even taught at school .
It is very exciting that entertainment and education can be merged for accomplishing the spread of knowledge along the masses in an enjoyable way .
Television series , contests , movies , and news which do it all the time without us being aware of it .
I am writing regarding the advertisement on USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I found this advertisement on the newspaper and I would like to state the reasons why I think I am suitable for the job at hand .
The groups I was in charge of mostly consisted of people from ages 6 to 12 , although I once had the chance to work with a group of young adults as well .
Everywhere I have worked before I have been praised for being very organised and having the ability to deal with unexpected situations successfully .
Usually , I do n't have much time to spend on myself since I am always occupied with something .
I have taken part of a basketball team since the age of 5 and I have recently become a young ladies ' group 's coach .
I did that for three summmers and I still help out at my parents ' restaurant when a hand is in need .
I would really appreciate it if you could take my application into account .
I am writing in response to your advertisement which I saw in the International Newspaper to apply for the job in the USA Summer Camps .
This year , I have finished my degree in Mathematics in the University of Zaragoza and in September , I will start to study to become in teacher .
I also have studied English language for ages and I consider that I have a good level .
Moreover , this job would be an excellent experience to improve my English and be more selfconfident .
As for my experience , I love working with children and I sometimes took care of my nieces which they are 10 years old .
My degree took up all my free time during this year , however , I tried to go on doing sport , especially running and playing football . I also try to keep up with the latest trends in sports events .
I describe myself as a sociable , responsible , trustworthy and hardworking person which likes working with children .
My favorite sport is Football , but it is not a sport that I like to practise it 's a sport to watch because it 's beautiful , very cool and very exciting to support a team in a championship .
I am Brazilian , and as almost everybody in my country , I 'm a big football fan .
The World Cup is happening now in my country Brazil .
I love it when this event happens , so many incredible games going on , best players of the world , three games per day at the start , and with very good looking players .
I do n't know what exactly happens but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes , everybody gets happier , Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers , people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody 's house .
I love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems , or just show us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects , a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delays in their construction , etc .
I love the World Cup , however i certainly would have preferred if it had been in another country .
Just running 30 minutes a day , you can improve your physical activity , lose weight , and improve your brain .
Also it helps you to release the daily stress and is a good motivator .
You start walking 10 minutes each day , then for 20 minutes and you can add more minutes till start running for 30 minutes and then for an hour .
In winter , you need to put on heavy clothes , while in summer lighter clothes , a hat and pair of glasses will be all you need .
In winter I go to run for half an hour in the afternoons , but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather .
Being a person that loves sports , it is hard for me to see gaining pounds through the years .
Once I decided that I needed to do something , I started walking around my place .
I was still out of breath sometimes , but I kept doing it because I wanted to achieve my goal to lose 10 pounds .
And now I am running 4 miles a day .

Scout ( Jean Louise ) Finch is a round character .
Her outter look seems like a little girl .
Talking from the outter look , one can easily see that Scout is not " the usual " girl .
Scouts character is kind of a tomboy .
She does not like to dress like a lady even when aunt Alexandra tries to make a lady out of her , Scout refuses to dress or speak like one .
In young age , before she went to school , she started reading .
Her intelligence in young age was a Problem for her teacher Miss Caroline , because never had such a well - educated pupil before .
Instead of celebrating it , she somhow inhibits Scouts learning .
Due to that Scout gets bored and starts to hate school .
Furthermore Scout often reacts very impulsive , mostly in young age .
Also when she had trouble with her cousin , because she called Atticus a " nigger - lover " Scout beats her up .
For her it is a method to make her mind clear .
Later on Scout begins to understand , not least because of her father and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
Somehow she reverts back to her old ways .
To conclude Scout is a smart girl with two sides .
On the one hand Scout acts very impulsive and is an obstreperous tomboy but on the other hand she is very clever and more adult than others in her age .
So you need information about my country 's eating customs ?
On weekdays , Dutch people take their breakfast , which usually consists of a few sandwiches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the weekend , we tend to sleep in and therefore take our breakfast a bit later .
The most important ones are probably hotchpotches : mashed potatoes and vegetables , often combined with smoked sausage .
A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty , consists of little thick pancakes , served warm with melted butter and icing sugar .
In a few hours time , I can get to some far - away destination .
Boats trips are long and boring .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best assests people and nations can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from their own .
However , it is probably a truism that reading about or watching films about a country are only pale subsitutes to actually going to visit a place and experiencing the differences yourself .
People started emerging from their houses , their faces stoned with fear .
But there was only one who knew what and where that explosion had occurred .
Just a day before Michael was arguing with his friends that Rasheed was a very nice guy .
So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula , that does not implicate that he is a terrorist .
He has been living in the U.K for the past 20 years .
But this act was out of question .
This was something that could not be argued upon .
Not knowing what would be the intellectual thing to do , the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police .
Sprinted towards what seemed like flames , only to find Rasheed standing across it , blood protruding from his right hand .
Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed he quietly returned to his house .
Whenever there is a possibility to buy a new item , one should follow it .
Shopping became the way of life for some people , who find it as a hobby as well as pleasant activity .
Sufficient to say , buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time .
Often , it turns out , that purchase should not take place at all , the reason being lack of money .
Likewise , the joy of shopping is dependent upon the items one intend to purchase .
Obviously , shopping for food is not equivalent to purchasing garments .
The article " Stairways to Heaven : Gothic Architecture , Heavy Metal , and the Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparallelled one in terms of the discussion it evokes .
The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for the Gothic architecture , and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article .
In order to explain the nature of the Gothic architecture and its major aspects , the author efficiently employs the musical analogies .
One of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one , as it employs the parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
For example , the purpose of both is to induce awe and , they both employ the concepts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these styles usually tend to abandon the classical tendencies , and both rose in a response to a new demand in the culture .
The number of people accessing public transport far outweighs the number of people the transport system was designed to handle .
The trains and buses are crowded , and newer routes and not reflecting the changing demand .
Mass production has made cars more affordable to the middle class in recent years .
Both these factors have led to increased purchase of cars over the last few years .
This trend is likely to continue in the near future .
Cars have the ability to take you from your home to your place of work , without any stopovers .
Further , after you board off the train , you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport .
She took a heavy sigh of relief as all the panic was finally over for her !
Her cherry red face glistened vigorously in the golden brown sunset like a perfectly baked pastry , as the last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horizon .
Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer , temperatures are not too cold and not to hot .
You can walk and smell the flowers beginning to flourish .
Summer is great because it 's time to hang up your shoes and relax .
When you drive by the neighborhoods you notice that families are all gathered in some kind of celebration .
That is why I am writing this letter , to make you know what is happening in the city and to tell you that the police are not doing their job .
I would also like you to talk to the police department , because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe , not to ignore us and say that everything is fine when everything is wrong .
I had never felt so nervous ... I looked in the audience , everyone was looking at me .
On the left side I saw my parents , okay , inhale , exhale , I can do this .
I have always dreamed of this , being a musical star on broadway .
I conpeted in singing competitions when I was younger and I took acting classes .
I arrived in New York a four months ago .
When I was taking a walk through the neighbourhood I saw this poster about the musical wicked and they were looking for someone to play the lead .
Of course I took this opportunity and two weeks later I had to do audition .
I felt like I messed up but the next day I got a call that I got the role .
And finaly , the moment was there , the opening night .
I put on my costume and walked on stage , I had to wait untill I opened the curtains .
Many people still consider television only as a way to relax , get entertained and stop thinking about all the problems that might worry them .
As it is a very common phenomenon between teenagers , schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new .
A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills , and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable .
Had I choose whether considering television educational or not , I would definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what is the sources of the information told during a tv show , as they might be misleading .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disappointed with town I live in because there is a lot to see !
I 'm really into showing you all the interesting places around .
To my mind , you 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those few first days when you had to get to know new surroundings .
So , as you asked me , I 'll give you proposal of an interesting place to visit where you could take a rest and relax .
Kachl 's Park is a perfact place to spend some time walking along paths , sitting on a bench , talking to each other .
In the public garden there are two ponds ( really nice place to sit and admire landscape ) , an antique wooden church , a swimming pool .
There is also quite big concert hall where , if you have luck , you can enjoy some interesting concerts ( in general for free ) .
I think it 'll be perfect place where you can spend some free time .
I can show you around the place and tell a bit more about the city .
Write to me back as soon as you decide when you want to go to the park . I 'll go with you with a pleasure .
when I saw your advertisement I instantly thought that I would like to work in one of your summer camps .
Since I used to work as a secretarian I feel capable of organizing sports and evening activities , if you choose to let me do so .
Even though cooking is not my favorite chore I would n't mind to work in the kitchens .
After this short description of myself I would just like to say that I have only heard good things about your summer camps from my relatives in the U.S. , so it would be my pleasure to work for you .
I am writing to you with concern about the U - turns your party have made in broke promises .
We believe none of the promises your party made were brought into action .
It was said you would stand up for elderly and ill people but nothing had changed .
Security against terrorism atacks were promised to be step up but policemen are not seen in the streets and neither are security cameras .
People were counting on this party to increase public expenditure , but pension 's money have stayed the same .
One of the most disappointing topics is that you played down the situation we are living and the necessities people has .
We were told this party would speak out against corruption , but now it is your own policy , and promises seem they were a bad joke .
We look forward this letter will make you back down and apologize to the ones that vote for your lies .
People are noticing your promises are not going to be made and I am sure there will be plenty of people complaining about the lack of true in your promises .
A large list of characters appears through the episodes , being the common thread that connects the two seasons the regular ones : Martin Compston ( as DS Steve Arnott ) , Vicky McClure ( as DC Kate Fleming ) and Adrian Dunbar ( as PSupt Ted Hastings ) .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken shot by another cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sways his professional judgement .
Fleming plays his partner 's part , an AC-12 's undercover specialist , who prides herself on being the consummate professional , unmoved by emotional considerations .
Both of them share superior , Hastings , who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer ; zealous and suspicious , not being everyone 's cup of tea .
Even though being widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards , he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances .
With calculated precision , the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies , and throws in a few twists and turns that makes your mouth drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethics principles and nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal team , has got a nice family and has recently been awarded " Officer of the Year " .
To conclude , those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry ; line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write third and fourth series and if you haven't tried it before , you 've just about got time to catch up .
Were you a UK tourist coming to Switzerland for a short weekend break fifteen years ago you would have found yourself in a situation that no shops would have Sunday opening hours .
I clearly remember bringing milk and bread over from Heathrow in Sunday morning !
Now you can shop on Sundays although your shopping spree still will be limited to Zurich railway station and the airport , not to mention some limited choice of simple foods at occasional motorway services .
But it is an improvement to say the least !
Although the size of an average supermarket in Switzerland will still remind you of a medium size village shop , there has been improvement there as well !
We can see now international brands we are used to in the UK .
But the prices will shock and surprise you , they double or triple the UK ones .
Not a good experience for ill - hearted !
If you have strong neves , do your window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich .
You can find the same stuff in Italy at half price !
Sarah was not exactly the coolest girl in the school but she came anyways , thinking that maybe for once she would be accepted in their group ... but no one was to be seen behind that window .
Sarah could have never imagined that the sneaky boys were hidden inside the abandoned house waiting for her entrance with eggs and tomatoes in their hands , ready to smash them onto her face .
She was just about to open the door to check the inside when suddenly a scream echoed from the house , the door slammed open and the group started running at full speed chased by four big spiders who just discovered that their home had just been occupied .
I guess that what goes around comes around !
" she shouted to them with a smile on her face , with this story to tell she will finally shut those boys ' mouths at school .
Usuallly he was energetic , full of confidence , ready to party .
But she had no intention to give up .
She had fought to hard for this life and she would not let their long - standing relationship to be ruined just like that .
By accident he thought .
Accident which had been well prepared by her .
He was not stupid but you could not expect any perls of wisdom from him .
He had never worked but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remembered their names .
They had never worried about money - all bills were paid by his trust found .
" Are you having a mistress?",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast .
" How could you even say that ? I would never ever do this to you . "
At that moment he was like a bear with soar head .
She wanted answers and to have them he needs to be alive not dead of heart attack .
" What is going on than ? And do not lie to me ! You have always been a very bad liar ! "
" We are broken .
Every morning I went to the port and unshipped .
Nobody there knows me so you should be afraid that some of our friends would recognise me .
Nobody will never know that we are poor now " .
This should be some kind of joke .
" We can move to smaller house or fired some of the servants ? "
And where I would put my wine collection ? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house "
They definitely had different idea of poverty .
But before clearing that she wanted to ask one more important question :
Since he was a little boy people around he knew that this child had a strange character .
He was really moody and he could move from extreme happiness to the most absolute sadness in a few seconds .
When he grew up he struggled to pass his illness and he became a sane , strong , handsome young adult man .
However all people in his neighborhoor feared him because of his past .
Therefore , he decided that he was going to meet new people for beginning a new life .
At the age of twenty years he achieved a job as a personal trainer where he earned enough money to rent a flat .
In this way , he moved to his new neigborhood where everybody respected him .
One day he fell in love with one of his female customers .
She was a beautiful , blond , tall , Polish girl called Magda who worked as an architect in a studio in the center of London .
Their relationship had been excellent since first time that they had met each other and two months later they decided to become lovers .
Slowly he became illness one more time .
Although he had been trying to hind this , his personal problems were ovbious and Magda did n't feel well with him .
Finally their relationship broke up and Michael fell in his illness deeper than ever .
Three months later Magda was walking with her new boyfriend and Michael saw them , he was totally insane and jealous , he caught an enormous stick from the nearest tree and he beat them as strong as he could .
The young couple of lovers fell on the floor and Michael got away to his home .
His insane evil mind go away until his flat .
At that moment everything changed , he reminded his childhood , his recovery and his sane life , then Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion public transport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convenient and at the same time the easiest way to reach any destination you wish to get to .
People have to sit next to other people they do n't know for a long time , in other words , you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers .
On the other hand travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not know so well .
This means you can set the time you want to leave , because you do not have to respect a specific timebable .
This way you will have the chance to have more relaxing journey through the countryside , traffic will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally you can plan the time you want to arrive , using a GPS or other technolology to help you plan your journey .
To sum up , travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town , but when you have to travel outside your specific territorry , nothing is better than a car .
Michael has been working very hard , and just seemed to really be over whelmed by all the work he had been carrying out through the course of the month .
Well on this particular morning , Michael seem to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be energetic and very vibrant that particular morning .
His attention to detail appeared to be trust worthy and correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged because of how reliable he is .
Well as the day was coming to a close Michael had a distinct feeling that something just was n't correct but he dismissed that feeling and continued with his day as he usually does .
Well the days responsibilities in Michael 's mind had been successfully accomplished and he felt really confident about all he had accomplished .
Needless to say Michael could n't have been any more deceived than he had realized , because the unfortunate thing is that when he was doing his walk through on all of his department the inventory that was supposed to be submitted was in fact inaccurate .
Because after Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
You sounded really stressed in your last email and I am worried about it .
Are things getting better today ?
I know you are under a lot of pressure because of your final exams and I can really understand how you are feeling right now , buried in a mountain of books and notes , with no free time for other things or just relax .
I 've passed for all this thing .
Do n't you remember how you cheer me up when things could n't get any worse ?
Nothing is worth than getting stressed out about .
If you can study in short bursts and take some breaks , you 'll be by far more efficient in your studies than slogging away for hours on end .
Think of it !
Another thing that it helped me a lot was doing regularly sport near home .
Jogging or going out for a walk helped me to boost energy levels and to clear my mind .
I think it 's very useful - and right now I sound like your Mom - is eating properly .
Try to eat fresh food , such as salads , tons of fruit and you 'll feel better .
Take care and do n't let it you down !
Considering all this , nowadays it is socially important a development in positive values among young people such as respect and tolerance to create honest adult people .
The 21st century has given a new meaning to the word Friendship .
From what evolved as a comradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship it has moved forth to relationships where people have not even met one another physically .
In the past friends were made when peopleet each other , other than of course pen friends .
Today with technology friends are made at a click of a key be it on social media or mobile devices .
Today with the BFF concept one has a best friend at every nook and corner for different purposes .
Friendship stood the test of time and grow stronger with disagreements fights and misunderstanding , all being resolved and forgotten in the name of friendship .
Today friendships are take take take and very few stand the test of time .
Friendship today is friend or friends for each season and reason while friendship of the past has been whatever the situation or time a friend stands through .
However , this does n't mean that my parents , especially when I was a child , always told me " yes " and made me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grow up with many " no " , and I do not always agree with them in different situations .
But they taught me all the important values and good manners , and I 'm grateful to them for this .
For nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in everything by their parents : they buy them whatever they want , and behave as " friends " .
I believe that this 's wrong , because by doing so they 're not doing their well .
This does n't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their son ; on the contrary , a son should talk to his family , asking for advice or just to confront each other , because communication is at the base of relationships of every kind .
I just think that each of us in our life plays a role , and that doing parents is not an easy job , but they should try to do their best .
The Miracle resort Bangkok ,
The miracle is an extraordinarily large resort .
Counting 33 stories in the main building it could be the biggest resort in Bangkok
The resort mainly focuses on children , which is in my eyes a good idea .
The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club has on the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kids Club 's Members everywhere in the hotel , except for your room .
The hotel handles privacy very well and I can guess most of the guests will appreciate it .
A more compact building would be more appreciated by most of the people .
Finding a new job has become a tough task for all the people who have just finished their studies .
Our plan is to go to Birmingham with my cousin Daniel who has been living there for 3 years and to stay with him just the time we need until we can find a job and a place to spend there tree months because we must return in October .
I think that it would be quite easy for Montse to find a job but I am quite worried about my opportunities .
If I am lucky I would apply for an interesting job , but I think that I will apply for a normal job such as barman , working on a factory , etc .
I hope that this adventure goes well because we are very excited and it would be useful in order to find a job when we come back to Spain .
You can tell because eyerybody looks at her like she is some crazy murdering kid .
Most of the students at Laura 's new school do not talk to her they are a little bit too cautious about interacting with her .
Frustrated Laura accepted her new life of solitude outside of the secret society of the others .
And she thought that this is her chance to get in , to be one of them .
He has not spoken one word to Laura but she followed him around since the incident .
One day when she walked him home she said : Okay , I give up !
If nobody talks to me than none of you have the right to judge me .
I do n't want to be a part of your life because if you act like that without knowing me than you do not deserve my attention .
He thought that this was very brave but he had not enough confidence to tell her that .
This TV series is presented by Netflix , an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show , anywhere , and in any device .
The series provides an unorthodox view into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit .
This connection allows them to see through each other eyes , and even control each other movements .
This decision made the series extraordinary , with scenes recorded in Seoul , Nairobi , San Francisco , Mumbai , London , Berlin , Mexico and Chicago .
To sum up , I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science - fiction , but also to anyone curious about different cultures as " Sense8 " provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters , their surroundings , religion , and traditions .
To be honest , in the questionnaire you send , I could give a positive response to the most of the questions but I do n't consider myself a code expert .
In JavaScript I have some experience but not in the necessary quality that is required for such a position , I think .
Like I told you , I 'm a web graphic designer , among other , focused more in design and my usage of code is very limited .
If I have to , I search the web for information and implement it but it requieres time .
Perhaps is there some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity .
About my CV you have , it is up to date and you can keep it , maybe you have some new offer that patches better with my profile .
The Food Network has become my favourite channel I can tune to it the whole day !
It 's so relaxing and very informative , I never get bored .
Cooking shows are fun to watch , but my most favourite shows are those about cakes and pastries .
I really enjoy baking that I often buy books about it .
Cheesecake for me is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students exchange programme .
I stayed with a local family , which happens to be the family of the person that stayed with me when he took part in the same programme .
His name is John , and like me he is getting a degree in Phisics Engeneering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center , such as CERNE , convinientely placed a few miles away from his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest free loans , available to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
Before addressing the question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind that both activities ( spending time on a computer and watching television ) are harmful for children's / teen 's health .
At the other side it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television .
With the help of computers young people can meet new friends , find out a lot of information , take part in forums and discussions .
There are plenty of free sites with content far from morality ; many computer games impose cruelty .
And the idea that , spending time in Internet 's chats young people develop their social skills , is problematic .
I wish it would be so !
But getting used to the Internet 's rules of comunication , they might find it difficult to face up to reality , make friends in the real world .
But when I want to relax I 'd rather watch TV with my friends than loiter away time sitting alone in front of the computer !
This restaurant is recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner of this restaurant a few years ago .
It has a unique modern - rustic interior design suitable for any occasion be it a birthday party , family gathering or even a date with your loved ones .
From my experience , I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality not to mention how delicious the food is .
Not only that , I was lost for choices as I flipped the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranges from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the list goes on .
The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the ones in the menu .
In my opinion , I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
So as the end of term is getting closer and closer , many students are being stressed out and it is certainly not different for me .
But if you know how to deal with your nervousity during exam period , you can take the success of passing exams for granted .
That is one of the most secure ways to make sure , you will manage things on time without getting any redundant stress .
Place it in the most visible and strategical point in your room and stick up to it .
Without a mind and body regeneration , you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest .
To kick off your day , give your body enough energy , in the form of proteins .
Also , to activate your brain quicker , go out for a fresh air .
Mark and leave the most difficult ones in the end .
I remember when I was a kid the only thing I use the phone was to call my friend to play on the street .
The telephone was convenience , something used to help people communicate , to make their lives easier .
Internet changed people 's routine .
Although the large number of advantages that Internet and phones give to us , the use of technology affect people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We just take turns talking ( chatting is maybe more correct to say ) and most of the times without any aim .
Using messages people forget to use grammar or even make full sentances .
The worst thing is that people do n't know how to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or even though old friends .
Nowadays communication face to face is something rare and most of the times accident .
People just take turns talking without putting any purpose or feelings .
Thank you for your enquiry and your interest to come here .
There are't many guidebooks about my city so I will recommend you a place worth seeing .
In the centre of the park there is a shaft which is The shaft is beautifully illuminated at night .
There is also a building which can be considered as an interacive museum .
In a very interesting way you can find somehing about the history of Siemianowice and about mines .
There is a lot of old photos compared with new ones .
What impress me the most is a combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks .
In that building you can find also a small cinema .
During summer park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events .
Silesian culture offers a lot so I think you will have fun visiting The Park of Tradition .
Basketball- the best sport ever !
It 's a team gameplay where you have to start and stop like in aerobics .
It burns lots of calories , build endurance and build up muscles .
80% of the game is mental , you have to think what move you should do next what the rest of the team is up to .
As well as being a great way to stay fit basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player .
Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as a few as two people even if the official games of basketball require 10 people .
The beauty of this sport is that as long as you got a ball you can spend hours dribbling or shooting on your own .
After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents ' life , not him , Marianne - for life or leaving and start fresh , he has finally chosen the latter , thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment .
But now , every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself , making second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he had with Marianne .
He had taken her out to a five - star restaurant , to which she insisted that it was too much , which got Michael to insist that it was okay .
A few weeks later saw the occurrence of their first fight .
Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throwing things to the wall , crashing plates from the counter to the ground , the whole nine yards .
A week later , he found that Marianne was cheating on him with a European businessman he did n't have the mind to remember the name of .
Nowadays the healthy habits of young people are very different than in the nineties .
And we need to know the reason for these changes and what we can do to improve it .
Firstly , it is true that the young people used to do sport daily in any where , at the school or in the street and also they did n't use to eat fast food .
Secondly , many people argue that the society has experienced a great changes in the family life .
Although they want the best for their children sometimes is difficult because they are tired and they tend to prepare junk food and allow them to spend their time on the internet or playing with the game machine .
In my opinion , parents should be concerned for their family 's comfort and should motivate their children to do sport , be in contact with a lot of people and avoid eating fast food .
The wind was freezing cold , and now he had to walk to the office , which was a 25-minute walk .
You lost your flight and it was a business trip!You're going to get fired ! "
He said to himself as he whimpered .
I 'm going to talk about doctor who , a British sci - fi TV show about an alien called the Doctor who travels through time and space in a police box called the TARDIS ( Time and Relative Dimension in Space ) .
The first episode aired in 1963 and since then Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci - fi TV shows on television .
Since the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been played by 12 actors , the newest one was announced on summer last year , which is when I was visiting London with my family .
It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor , it appeared in the news , in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .
Since I was in London , I thought it could visit The Who Shop , it is a shop dedicated to Doctor Who and it has a museum with costumes and other things that have appeared in the TV show .
We did n't have much time to go there because it was far from our hotel so I had to go only with my father while the rest of my family was somewhere else .
If we had stayed more time we would have been able to spend more time at the shop but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop .
When the BBC finally announced who was going to play as the 12th Doctor , many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they did n't like it .
But hopefully not everyone was like that .
When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it , that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing as the 11th Doctor .
Nobody liked him at first but now that he is leaving everybody loves him and wants him to stay .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role .
Anyway , before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor 's role , the fans had started making suppositions about who could act as him .
Some said that he would be played by others famous British actors but others thought that an actress should play the new role .
Thanks to it I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourites TV shows .
I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention , also I like it because the plot is incredible , something that happened on season one can be connected with some of the last episodes .
As I am studying physical education , I have a lot of experiences of looking after children .
Last year a group of little kids came to university and we had to taught them several games and outdoor activities - thanks to this project , I am able to organise entertaining sports and activities .
I have just completed a 5 years course in English and I got very good marks .
In my view , I am sure I am the right person for the job - because I have patience with children , I know what they enjoy doing , and my cooking skills are very useful too .
She 's been talking to him plaintively to put him to sleep , reading him the same old tatty paperback book with one fairy tale only .
I 'm ok .
I 'm ok .
She read it at least twenty times , then threw away and prepared her soul for their father 's arrival .
Most if not all of inhabitants of this planet would answer ' yes ' .
Last century provided us countless opportunities to be more mobile .
We , humans , can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical first time in all our history .
The world of the first half of the XIX century was quite different from that .
Of course , most of westerners already were able to imagine the Globe with relative accuracy , but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours .
It rather had the same shades with medieval maps that pictured dragons guarding earthen paradise somewhere near the shore of Indias .
By ' shades ' I mean not real colors , but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes in touch with .
- Nelson Mandela I believe that education is important and it is able to bring about enormous changes to an individual .
Since I was a kid , I have started to think of being a teacher .
That 's why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences for being a teacher in my future pathway .
Since I was in F.5 , when I became capable to teach somebody , I started to be a Korean teacher and a private English tutor .
Apart from that , it has been a good practice for speaking .
As a teacher , I have to talk in front of many students and that fostered me to become a better speaker .
As to enhance my knowledge , I tried to grab chance to bring up my English level .
In 2014 , I had completed the ' Let 's Debate ' writing program offered by The Standard and written a total of 4 articles for the ' Let 's Debate ' column of The Standard Student and Junior Standard .
It had been a truly valuable program for me and it brushed up on my English .
Moreover , I had also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest on 2015 .
These experiences were tremendously memorable to me and it was my honor to take part in these events .
Apart from that , as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communications between people , I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself .
Other than Korean , I have also been learning Japanese and Spanish starting from F5 .
Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me , it can also bring me satisfaction and gratification .
I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages in the university .
Therefore , I have always been willing to be offered the chance to take and English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal .
In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules .
However , it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone , and proper times to learn .
Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it to our habits .
However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
I consider that something should be done in order to balance pros and cons of having mobile phones present at schools because , firstly , students are the ones who must be present and , what is more , their learning process also must be there .
Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
Technology and , mostly , mobile phones are part of children and parents lives , so schools do n't have to ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't make a negative effect in education .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue .
First , to have a successful campaign it is important to know the target market .
After studying our advertising options , it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose .
On the other hand , we can set up stands in shopping malls .
In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples .
As I mentioned above , advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market .
I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us .
This is mainly because besides being cheaper customers will become familiar with the product .
If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product I can assure you that we will succeed .
Twenty years ago the economic situation was better than the current , so people did n't have to work until late and they managed to give a strict education and to care about their children 's health .
Now things have changed : parents work full time and do not take up a lot of their children who are more and more alone and uncontrolled .
When home is empty , teenagers feel free to spend all the time lying on the couch , playing videogames or watching awful programmes on TV .
At the same time they gorge themselves with every kind of food they find in the refrigerator .
A sedentary life style and a poor diet lead of course to overweight .
This is a common issue : in fact juvenile obesity is increasing with bad consequences such as premature diabetes or a permanent disease .
For those people who want to combine fun and health , a good solution could be the running , which is a free , competitive and complete sport .
In Milan the association Runners from Mars welcomes thousands of runners who compete for charity .
It would be a good way to change a lifestyle !
I normally dream but do n't remember when I wake .
One day dreant that I were a millionaire , I bought a huge detached house surrounded by tall trees in a beautiful city , maybe in a city like Seville .
Upstairs , there would be games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could see our favourite films .
First of all , I would like to thank you for offering to look after my house and my bird pet while we go on holidays .
This means a lot to me , you are a wonderful friend .
We are leaving very late at night , but I managed to leave a copy of the key in the reception of the building , you can keep it with you .
I know the only time you have to go there is in the morning , before you go to work , so I would like to ask you to give priority in changing the water for my bird , and seeing if there is still enough seeds in her bowl which , by the way , are in a box next to the cage .
I also left yoghurt and frozen food for you to prepare in the oven or microwave , this way you wo n't have to worry on going back home to have lunch before going to work .
We will be back by the end of the week , so take care and enjoy your mornings with my bright bird , she loves having company so if you could get her to have lunch with you and talk a little with her , she will be happy for the rest of the day .
I ca n't wait to be with her again , I do n't like leaving her for a long time .
Three years ago , I was working as a Spanish teacher in a boarding Australian school .
At the weekends , I carried on a workshop on leisure activities for children in need .
With the rise in time , the entire world has become one concrete jungle .
The human race began from the jungle where he lived amidst the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees and now the journey of human race has come to the same scenario where once again , he is living amidst the fears of wild beasts called ' other humans ' and under the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwart buildings that may either collapse due to an earthquake or a terrorist - attack .
This is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under our feet because of internet , we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
I , for that reason , certainly agree with the statement of the given issue .
The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world .
Interestingly , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements , for they have constructed machines that exhibit the working of brains through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to his worries .
In contrast to this , the religions that have survived since the earlier times had discreet knowledge , however they had a much deeper impact .
Scientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions , however , ironically , it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology .
Likewise , there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who time and again circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation ( illuminati , for instance ) that runs the world secretly and plots for all the pre - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorists ascertain that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules over the international media , thereby being omnipotent .
They present complex informations so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thus , by all means , today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to allocate and obtain endless information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes a common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being - exploited life .
I choose option A : I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transit .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
In other words , if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
I think this way can assist them in adapting to society early .
I am forty years old secondary school teacher of Art and I believe I have qualifications that you may be looking for . I have been teaching students for approximately 15 years .
I used to run summer camps and art 's workshops .
Working with groups of people fills me with lots of energy and as they need me I need them too .
I have been studying English for several years and I am preparing for taking FCE exam soon .
I enjoy partcipating in debates .
I would describe myself as a good listener and fluent speaker with strong ability to control the discussion .
Apart from ability to get on well with people I read a lot .
I go to the cinema regularly to stay in touch with new coming 's .
If you would like to take my appliciation further than I would be pleased to hear from you .
The aim of this proposal is to compare the two proposed venues River Boat Disco and Milford Comedy Club and to recommend one based on the survey carried out among the students .
Not only does River Boat Disco has its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more then appropriate for this occasion .
However the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early at 10:30 pm , whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
The pricing for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Even though the price is $ 5 smaller for comedy club , it is without food and by the end of the night I do not think there would be much difference .
However the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi .
I would suggest the River Boat Disco because not only does it offer a buffet , but also the people are more likely to converse with each other while listening to music than to a comedian .
There is a great variety of dishes , from starters to main dishes and desserts , my recommendation is garlic bread as a starter .
This restaurant is very affordable , the prices are extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because there 's a special menu called " student 's menu " where you choose two ingredients for you pizza with or without French fries and a drink for about three euros .
Everyone in the staff is extremely nice and very often the owners come to make small talk with the clients .
All in all , I think this woould be the best restaurant for our class to go , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
Also everyone enjoys Italian food , so everyone would be pleased .
Dreaming about future is like creating an imaginary world , perfect for yourself and the others .
If present does n't satisfy you , let 's take a trip in the future .
Year 2064 .
People are living their lives in a way that we would consider it more than shocking .
Everyone is leaving their perfectly " normal " lives in the sky .
You 've read it well .
Because of the lack of space , people had come with a brilliant idea of creating these floating houses , they are made of a special type of glass and have a spherical shape .
By finding this solution , they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment .
When it comes to their jobs , people work on earth , like oldtimes .
They have cars , not like the cars people from 2014 were used to , but they still call them this way .
Once the button is pushed the car finds the driver and literally picks him up .
overall , this is an image of the future .
Now let 's return to the present because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future eventually .
In 2012 I got the Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've been improving my French to pass the exam .
It 's six months since I started teaching gymnastic in a primary school near Milan and I discovered that children are more competitive and honest than adults and I appreciate this .
I always try to motivate them with some educational play and I make them understand how important it is the group .
The school will be close in Summer , so I 'll be available from the 15th of June to the 30th of September .
For references , you can contact the Principal of the School , who will be happy to supply you any information .
Taking a gap - year before starting a university is a lifetime opportunity for lots of people .
It 's a time to develop yourself , to travel , to find friends .
You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on university camp .
You can go on a road trip around your country or travel somewhere very distant and learn things you 've never heard about on your own skin .
You will definitely part your ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime .
You only live once and wasting such a great possability is unthinkable .
From booking a flight to videocall a distant friend , anything seems very handy nowadays .
However , the main drawback of such advance is that we now rely more on computers than on our capacities .
We are slowly but inesorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that even a single day without technology would turn out to be a nightmare .
How many times in the last ten years have we given up GPS and used a common paper map for a trip ?
Reality is that the fast - paced world we are currently living in is stealing us our own time .
In my view , we should all riconsider the role that computers have gained in our lives .
It was the last year I was attending the high school and final exams were approaching faster than I thought .
Suddenly a plethora of concerns filled my head up : what to do after the school ?
And finally , as for all , the day arrived .
Then when finally it was my turn I seated in front of the teachers and , slowly , I introduced my speech .
Fifteen minutes later it was all over and I felt a brand new person .
After this event I can cope with everything !
As it was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow obtaining that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context , even so the data collected and the following conversation with the teacher , contributed to obtain an interesting picture about how Arts and Crafts is considered and carried out under CLIL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language , the artistic .
How to provide student with more real and relevant input , in the daily routine of an art class , seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers , who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language .
It is interesting to see how the students resort each other looking for help in a natural way , without the intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about CLIL atmosphere .
I am writing to express my interest to the bar staff opening you have posted on our school 's noticeboard .
First of all , I strongly believe that I would be the most suitable applicant because of my long experience in bar servicing .
For last six years , I have worked in a number of different bars within the busy city district region .
I know what involves in a late night customer service and how to deal with a loud environment .
All of the bars I worked hosted a night club after 10 PM therefore you do not need to worry about extra tiredness caused by late hour work .
In addition , my knowledge acquired by managing a bar and a certification in hygeinic food handling will guerantee the clean environment of your bar .
At last , I would like to emphasise my professionalism towards alcohol service .
I am a bartender who has awarded three times in international bar - show contests .
If you need a trial session , I am more than happy to attend and prove my assets to your bar .
The time allocations you have suggested on the job advertisement also suit my schedule perfectly .
Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aware of the mistakes they are making .
I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
Now we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
Let 's start to focus our attention at the pellet stove .
The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e .
In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
This is a pretty compact machine but it 's not very efficient and very clean .
Actually , it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano - particle .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Like in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
Now , thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms .
Basically the two rely on the same methods : burning pellets to warm up a fluid ( air for the stove and water for the boiler ) .
Knowing a clean and tidy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shopping , both the authority and the citizens understand the need to keep our city clean in order to keep the tourists coming , therefore they are serious in protecting the environment .
To keep the city clean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally friendly attitude in daily life : they refuse littering , if they can not find a rubbish bin around , they keep rubbish in small plastic bag ; at home , they separate the recyclable items from the rubbish before they get rid of the rubbish .
They follow the government 's advice to set the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees of Celsius .
It build sewage sites for the disposal of the city 's waste .
We are lucky to live in a city where both the authority and the people have a strong sense of environmental protection .
Among a variety of sports , there is the football also known as soccer .
Since I was very young , roughly at the age of thirteen , football became my favorite sport and it was an activity that I could never stop doing .
As the time passed , I became more skilled at football .
I signed up for a feminine football team in my city .
We had our own trainer , which was a man who played football before .
Secondly , it has helped me to improve my health condition in several ways .
For example , it contributes to my cardiovascular system .
And thirdly , it is an activity where I have been able to make new friends who , besides playing football as me , are very similar to me in other features .
As you get involved with football and you enroll with this sport , you will clearly notice the benefits it brings to your daily life .
' I think we 're being followed ' said Sara to me , as we pulled over the street .
Despite the fact that We 'd had to share a table with others tourists , we 'd had a great time .
Sara had left our hire - car keys on top of the table and had paid no attention to them for a while .
When we were about to leave we realized that there were a short letter on the table . ' I have your car keys .
Wait for me , please ' it said .
We 'd been driving for half an hour when I noticed that there were a white car behind us .
We pulled over the main road .
You 've had the wrong keys and the wrong car ' said the man .
As soon as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mistaken car keys in the restaurant because both of them were exactly alike .
We exchange addresses and as time went on we became good friends .
I ended up working to Mr Smith ' company in Madrid where I 've been working there for 20 years .
People seem to be living quiet comfortable lives nowadays .
When thinking about how the lives of people will be like in the next 50 years , the first thought that comes to my mind is a person sitting lazily on a sofa that can adjust itself to his / her will .
The reason for the laziness is that the work of the house will be done by robots .
This is how I think life would be in the next 50 years .
Robots will continue to be improved , till they will be able to do all work at home , so no one rich enough to afford a robot would bother to do the work himself / herself .
However , not everything about the life in the next 50 years will be positive .
Shopping is my favourite pastime , and I simply can not imagine anything more relaxing and joyful than spending my hard - earned money .
But with a heavy heart I have to agree with this statement .
There might appear a few situations , when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache .
The best example here could be the regular , every - week filling - the - fridge shopping , which in principle can not be pleasant .
Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley . Crowd in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another , because these shops are organised in the way , which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .
What is more I hate do shopping when I really need to buy something .
Because there is this wicked , unwritten rule , according to which if you are looking for something , there is not the slightest chance you will get it .
Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male kind , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .
The constant grumbling , regular checking the time , this anxious and adrift facial expression - how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping ? !
And believe me there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them , it always looks this way .
In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and spend a great time .
You just have to avoid supermarkets , buy clothes in advance - so there will not appear the situation , when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet , and of course of the male company , better choose the female companion .
I saw your advertisement and would like to apply to work in the USA in one of your Summer camps .
Since then I have attended a course for the preparation of the CAE exam , and spent two weeks in Ireland during the Summer working as a babysitter , so I have had experience working with children .
This can be noted in the fact that I was head of entertainment in my High School for two years .
During these two years I was responsible for the organisation and booking of bands .
I love learning new skills and although I 've never worked in a kitchen before but I 'd love to try my hand at cooking .
I quickly took my things and went out of the classroom hoping to arrive as soon as possible home .
Ten minutes after I had already taken my trainers and closed the gym door when I saw her walking towards me .
-"Michie!Wait for me ! "
I only wanted to tell you that Joe is going to make a party in his house tomorrow at 8 p.m. and I 'll be there "- she said
-"Thank you for the information . Bye "- I said , knowing what I was n't going to do tomorrow .
Half an hour after I arrived home .
And Cass , the girl I 'm in love with slammed the door .
My name is Richard Raya , I am 35 years old and live in the Basque Country in northern Spain .
in a one on one role .
Without knowing it , I was preparing myself for a position like this one , such as working
skills in sports and also a fun loving attitude towards organising activities .
pastimes , when I cook it 's usually for a big group of friends , so preparing meals is actually something I
I am available at anytime as the summer holidays are upon us .
Do you practise any sport ?
If so , you will know all the benefits but also effort that it takes .
For me it was n't funny at all so I always tried to skip my classes , and I finally did n't go back the following year .
I think that this is not a usual sport , but it has the same advantages : it burn calories , improve circulation , is good for the bones and muscles ... Therefore is a really beautiful way to exercise and help you to improve flexibility .
My advice for people who would like to start dancing ballet is : do n't be afraid , it does n't matter if you are seven or seventy , if you want to do it you can .
Dear director ,
I would really like to participate as a co worker in this summer camp .
Whereas in my opinion , it is way more than that .
By looking after children between the ages of 8 and 12 , I can experience new skills that will be useful in my future with my future kids .
On the one hand , I have never worked in the kitchens before .
First , the fire , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadays with technology .
The discovery of electricity has increased our productivity greatly .
Instead of just working during the day , man now could continue working during the night .
Then with TVs , information started to spread faster and faster until our contenporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands .
Sometimes it seems we have reached the pinacle of existence .
I 'm sure the pharaos of Egypt felt that way when they gazed at the Pyramids .
Now , we can look at those Pyramids from the other side of the world , receiving a live video feed in a device we hold in our hands .
In the next 50 years , who know what we will be able to accomplish .
Education and technology are deeply related , to a certain extent in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years .
In present times it is very common to see people learning courses through a computer .
Online learning has become a modern phenomena in order to gain knowledge ; however , face - to - face learning is still the better learning option chosen by students .
Although there are many differences among these two , similarities can be found as well .
Currently , exist all types of courses via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
For instance , degree courses , master courses or just an updating course can be found .
Adding to this , both learning options require time and dedication from students ; otherwise , knowledge will not be properly delivered .
On the other hand , differences between face - to - face learning and virtual learning are numerous .
Firstly , online learning conveys flexibility in its shedule .
Studentd can attend courses when they decide , but always respecting due dates .
Another difference between face - to - face learning and online learning may be that face - to - face learning allows students to develop human - relationships , whereas online learning is quite impossible on this to happen .
During face - to - face learning students have a teacher - student relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop inter - personaal skills and coexistence .
Last but not least , time spent on these courses are different too .
When doing a fece - to - face course besides having an attendance schedule , people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given .
In current days , traffic jams are a fact in big cities ; therefore a lot of time is lost commuting .
Consequentlu , both learning options have their positive and negative aspects .
Assessing these similarities and differences each student has the option to choose the option which better suits in his lifestyle .
Peschiera Borromeo , a little town near Milan , has an agricultural reality and there are many possibilities to walk around and to train yourself in a running parcour .
Unfortunately there is a lot of traffic , so the best place to avoid it is a little artificial lake called Idroscalo where people can run along the 7 kilometres perimeter or cycling open air while looking at the swans .
In this area you can find many facilities such as two swimming pools , a tennis and a volleyball court .
People can also try canoeing at the local school or the water skiing with a mechanical device that drags you on the water .
For those who feel brave , there is also a wall where you can climb with all equipment .
If you too have got a dog and want to teach him something useful , take him here every Sunday morning and a trainer will teach him how to save people from drowning and your friend will become a lifeguard !
In his opinion the concept of protectionism in the world of global economy is not effective .
There is a good example involving developing countries , which economies have been successful due to being the most opened to free trade , and countries with a low economic growth , that closed themselves off to international trade .
Although in the lecture it is admitted that international competition can cause problems to local businesses , mentioned in the article , he claims that it is worth competing with global corporations , because this way survived local companies may get stronger than ever .
And finally , the article states that free trade does not always lead to peaceful relationship between nations , but the lecturer draws attention to European common market set up after World War II .
To test the research 's hypothesis , self - administrated questionnaires were used on a total of 400 customers .
The target population included telecommunication service users who subscribed a loyalty program .
The choice of telecommunication industry in this framework is related to the vital role of loyalty and retention in this service setting .
This sample size allows us to perform multiple data analysis ( multivariate and SEM ) .
Everyone in this world has their own favorite sports , so do I. My favorite sport is football .
I often play this with my friend in the evening .
Football is played at a professional level all over the world , and millions of people regularly go to football stadium to follow their favorite team , whilst millions more avidly watch the game on television .
In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations ; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world .
football player .
I learnt teambuilding , discipline as well as teamwork through playing football .
There are many worldwide international competition of football .
One of the major international competitions in football is the World Cup organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
The next World Cup takes place in Russia 2018
The star I admired most in football is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , nicknamed Pelé , is a former Brazilian football player and thought by many to be the finest player of all time .
Since his full retirement he has served as an ambassador for the sport .
There are many reasons as football is my favorite game .
Holidays are mostly about relaxing therefore I disagree with always trying new things .
In my mind , holidays are essentially about being comfortable , staying in your element and simply enjoying your time off and not about creating uncomfortable situations if that might be the outcome of trying new things .
Change is never easy and being able to try new things is indeed a valuable trait for one to have , however I do not have such traits .
On the contrary to the subject I disagree having to try new and challenging things on holidays due to the fact that I take much more pleasure reading novels which make me feel all the rush of an outside activity all the while keeping me safe and comfortable .
The actors and literally amazing .
Their acting is on spot and the costumes and magnificent .
The role of Suleyman is played by Turkey 's most famous actor Halit Ergenc and he 's amazing at it .
The actress who plays Suleyman 's wife , Hurrem is none other than Meryem Uzerli .
There are many languages people in my country learn , but English would be the most popular as it is a world wide language .
Who learns languages in my country
Other language of their choice follows at secondary school .
Students at some schools also have a possibility of exchange programmes but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event .
Adults usually attend language courses , or use a variety of on - line courses .
I would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach at schools instead of giving private lessons .
It would also be wise to donate schools that prepare exchange programs for their students , so that more of them could afford that .
example , is there _ park or cinema nearby ?
It would be great if all of us have a healthy life .
As a consequence , they become slim and they do n't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life
On the other hand , teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones , video games and television which make them being more sedentary .
Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside and run or ride a bicycle would be a better option .
This way they would be doing physical exercise .
Finally , to be healthy it is also important to eat balanced food .
Snacks , fast food , fried food and sweets are part of young people 's life as they can find them everywhere : in the shops on the street , at parties and in shopping malls .
Being sedentary and eating fast food will not bring them anywhere .
It is easy , fast and , we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance -shorter rather than longer .
It is initially expensive but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us and even think we can not live without it .
Publis transport is always going to be slower , less flexible and much less convenient but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet .
We are complying to the norm .
Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process .
If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person , it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment .
Although the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs .
Thus , a person 's age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs .
In order to achieve its objectives , Trivago invested more money in the promotion in 2014 .
For example , it promoted their search engine by the television commercial and Youtube advertisement .
The Youtube advertisement means the viewers have to be enforced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video in Youtube .
Since most of the people watch the television not just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s ) in Youtube , they will be enforced to watch its advertisement more than one times .
Trivago has a very simple and rememberable tagline which is ' Hotels ?
The audiences are easy to think of Trivago when they are thinking about hotels .
Also , Trivago wants to increase its market share by entering Hong Kong Market .
Many Hong Kongers love to travel and go to different country to feel the culture and enjoy the different lifestyle .
Many of them try to plan the cheapest way for their trip include booking the worthiest hotel .
If they aware the benefits of using Trivago , they will love to use this as they could spend less time to compare all the hotels .
Therefore , Trivago use the advisement to increase its market share in Hong Kong .
Moreover , Trivago is trying to enhance the company image in Hong Kong .
Trivago is not much common in Hong Kong .
Some people even probably do not know what it is .
If Trivago want to gain benefits from the Hong Kong market , it has to develop and enhance their brand image .
Trivago is trying to represent that it is the most convenient hotel search engine in the market .
The last but not the least , Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost all the advertisements are encouraging audience to download its mobile application .
If there are more people download its mobile application , it means more people to know its brand and use its service .
We found one of the Television advertisements which is currently undertaking in Hong Kong .
The advertisement is about 16 seconds .
There is a narrator introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates " how to use its mobile application to search for a worthiest hotel . "
At the last of the video , the screen shows a tagline and the website of Trivago .
Television Commercial
In general , television is the most popular media in Hong Kong .
Advertising by television is an effective way to communicate the service to the general public .
Since that television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time , more potential customers will be exposed to its service .
Music helps stimulates sense and focus attention toward the advertisement .
The background music in the advertising is relaxed and excite .
It can make people feel youthful and it matches to the taste of young adults which are Trivago 's target customers .
It helps audience to better recall the advertisement and stored it in long - term memory .
The television advertisement shows the service being using .
It demonstrates all the steps from searching the hotel , choosing selection criteria and comparing the price to different hotels .
Through the demonstration , Trivago can show to the audience how easy to use its mobile application to find a worthiest hotel .
It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly to know what its service is .
On the other hand , as a mobile application , some people probably feel confused about how it operates .
Therefore , with the visual effect , demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application .
The television commercial presents information to the audience in a straight - forward manner .
For example , he says the application can instantly compare the rates to over 150 websites .
For those who are high interested in hotel searching service , they may notice to such informative advertisement .
It clearly presented that its searching engine can help the customers to compare the price of over 150 websites of hotels in the world and find the most worthy hotel .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition .
This strategy shows its profession and reliability for its target customers .
At the same time , it increases the confidence of the customers for choosing its services .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to enhance its popularity in there .
Before 2014 , Trivago is not famous in Asia .
It needs to utilities some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services toward its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives .
In the television commercial , the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application in their mobile phone .
It encourages customer to purchase its services and truly make use of it .
The purpose is to increase the sale and enlarge its market share in Hong Kong .
Moreover , " Means - End Chain " is adapted in the television advertisement .
By using the Trivago 's services , customers can search the worthiest price of the hotel room to gain benefit .
Trivago can achieve the personal value for customers through the advertisement .
Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasure journey with lower prices and the freedom of choosing their favorite accommodation .
The advertisement can show that they are wisdom by using Trivogo service to plan an economically trip .
Mean - End Chain is being used as Trivago is not only to help customer search for a hotel room , but also to achieve the personal value for customer which is worthier than money the customer saved in booking a hotel room .
Trivago use this way to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage since the value of its services is increased .
Audience can easily remember the brand name and get a plain awareness and knowledge of Trivago services .
Trivago does not choose radio to be their media as it is antiquated .
Attention of the radio commercial is low .
Also , radio advertisements only contain verbal effect .
Even through people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago , they probably do not know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal vocabulary .
It makes people hard to search Trivago on the Internet .
Therefore , the product awareness driven by radio advertisement is not enough .
Newspaper is also not a good media since newspaper has been recently replaced by online newspaper .
Likewise , Trivago is an online service so Newspaper advertisement may not appropriate for it .
Lastly , hire spokesperson consequent high cost in promotion .
And there is a risk of hiring a spokesperson as he may not bring an expected return for the company .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the focus of audience maybe shifts from the product to the spokesperson .
The promoting objective is difficult to be achieved .
Therefore , television commercial is likely the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong .
Not even a month before he had paid a fortune to get his place refurbished and painted .
He headed the front door in rage .
Jacob remained there bursting in rage .
While he was standing on the pavement tears of resentment covered his face .
Have you ever watch a game that involves people running around a field and scoring goals by kicking a ball ?
I know that for some , playing football is boring but for me , it 's the most awesome thing ever .
I 'm a freak when it comes to football .
I think I had watched almost all the football matches in history especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season .
Although , I do n't play really well , but I would choose it over any other sports any day .
I would feel free when I 'm in the field .
Both of them are just like me , we freak out when it comes to football !
90% of our conversation includes football and we can talk all day about it for sure .
Here is some advice to someone who is starting to this sport .
Make sure to play smoothly for the first time and make sure to use a football shoe when you 're playing in the field .
This advice is to avoid you from injuring yourself as a beginner in football .
I 've played tennis for 5 years now and I can assure you it 's one of the best sports any person can do !
Also , I love it because it takes my mind off worries .
As well as that , tennis gives me the opportunity to stay fit and meet new people .
Since it 's not very easy at the beginning , if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and train at least twice a week .
All in all , I 've practised many sports in my life but tennis 's been far the best exercise for both , my mind and body .
I really get a lot of pleasure in doing it .
My hero and my foe
Clown Bassie , on the other hand , is an actor of a TV - programme for children .
After a live show , he made a little girl crying by shouting at her and then kicked her in the back .
Clearly , travel in your own car is much more comfortable than on public transport .
These people believe that ver the next few years we will see a severe decline in the amount of people using bus , trains , trams , etc . to get places .
In my opinion , this is dissapointing for a number of reasons .
First of all , public transport bring us closer to other people .
By using public transport we reduce our carbon footprint and help to save the Earth .
Furthermore , we also save time : as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park , which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park , or wasting money in expensive carparks .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody 's life , we should use it every day to save the Earth , money , and time .
Directed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of fantasy novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young Alice Troubled by a strange recurring dream , the loss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives .
Unsure of what to does , she chase a rabbit in a blue waistcoat , and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole From which she emerges in a forest , where she is greeted by many strange creatures .
There Alice will star an adventure where she must slay the Red evil Queen and restore the White Queen to power .
But we must not forget about the marvelous acting of Johnny Deep ( as the mad hatter ) and Helena Bonham Carter ( as the red queen ) , with them the film would n't be the same .
But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design , they really managed to create something amazing with the appearance of characters .
Firstly , I should say that life nowadays is unthinkable without science .
In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
Without its help , for example , we would have never realized were we have come from .
By using computers nowadays it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for .
There is no secret for the human beings today because they have explored every place on the Earth .
They climb the highest mountains , dive in the depths of oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science .
The present belief is that scientific approach will solve all the problems and do away with all difficulties .
That is why science is so significant nowadays .
The obsession to know everything has led some of us to make dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives .
With its help we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person must provide themselves with the necessary skills . « What can I do for my life ? » .
After all a successful career is best measured in how satisfying you find it , and it 's easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting .
While we are studying we may not think seriously about job .
But in a few years time our job will be one of the most important things in our everyday life .
When someone asks an adult " what do you do ? "
Work , for most of us , will be the defining aspect of life and thus of our identity .
Through our work we find an identity , we can find status , intellectual stimulation as well as wealth which enables us to buy comfort .
Our working identities can change over time , our identity and behaviours as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader .
Our ability to develop our identity is critical to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles , we need to shed our old identity and add new elements .
We each have a picture of who we are and what we will / won't do in our heads , once formed our brains garner the evidence that it is a true picture and ignore evidence that suggests that it is not true .
So people say ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it true . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a self fulfilling prophecy .
We can change our beliefs , actions and thus our identity through experimentation , practice and conscious self discipline .
In an age where career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world in order to develop and expand your career options .
There are more than 200 old , abandoned , local buildings in our capital city .
But most of them are about to be declined by town planners .
Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are estimated .
Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money , they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
And above that , without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
This might cause that town planners will think there are not enough reasons to keep them .
After all , the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience especially in a large city such as London .
Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt in your stilleto while you are making your way to a bus station .
Indeed , the method by which a person go from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
Transportation is very important in our daily life and in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is inconvenience .
This is why , most of us , prefer to travel with our own car rather than by a public transport ; not only that it keeps us within our private sphere , it also keeps us dry travelling on a rainy day .
Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced in a public transport .
So when I came across this advertisement yesterday , I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job .
I believe myself to be a suitable person for this job , as I am a hard working , reliable , cheerful , fun - loving person .
Those children are too old for babysitters now , but I love children and would really like working with them again .
I believe myself to be a proficient cook , as I 've always cooked for my family in the weekends .
Two years later we moved back , but I continued speaking in both Dutch and English to my parents .
Thank you so much for your time , I hope you 'll consider me for this position .
Yours sincerely ,
It means that other people feel challenged and do n't want to fall behind and look underdogs .
Without this stimulus they may have been inactive .
On the other hand almost equal number of people may maintain a contrasting point of view .
They give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless .
I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns .
The desire of some country 's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question as " yes " or " no " because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view .
She checked the hour , then decided to call Michael .
He 'll call later'she thought .
She wanted to surprise Michael with delicious pasta and some rose wine .
The ride felt like and eternity .
She parked her car a few meters away for Michael 's office and walked up to it .
I 'm pregnant and we need to solve this out .
" I do n't know."said the familiar male voice . "
You need to understand this . I 'll pay alimony and help you with the kid , but I can not lose Susan " .
she could n't believe her ears .
Michael has been cheating on her .
Full of rage and disappointment she opened the door and saw the woman sitting in Michael 's lap .
When she got home she packed some of her belongings and drove to her best friend 's house .
She heard heavy footprints on the stairs and buried her head deeper in the pillow .
I am very happy to see you all ones again .
I am here today to deliver a speech to you about boycott bullying .
These days we see in the walls written boycott of stop bullying .
Do we know the real meaning of the word bullying .
Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems .
Bullying can cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .
In conclusion , I would like to say that self harm , low self esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools . We need to stop this .
Now to boycott bullying form our school i request all of you to take an oath that , I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying . I will treat others with respect and kindness .
I will have to compassion to not be a bully and the courage to not to be a bystander .
Michael was sitting on the bench of the garden , waiting for his mother to finish her work .
She was on the cold ground , laying like a dead body , her son sat by her side , trying to wake her up .
He stopped when he saw the dark shadow walking to him .
It was a man in his late thirties , very thin and light grey eyes .
He raised his hand , whom was holding a metal bar , full of blood .
Michael had no time to scream , he was already laying on the floor , by his mother 's side .
She was not dead , but in coma , in a hospital .
He was in the same state as her for about a week after the drama , and had to live on his own for the years who came .
He walked up to her room , where she was comfortly sleeping in her bed .
Tonight , she would be gone , he already signed the papers , his choice was made .
He took a deep breath before leaning over her and kissed soflty her forehead .
I am twenty - year - old student in my second year at National University of Culture of Ukraine .
Also , I can play several music instruments , such as : violin , guitar , drums and tambourine .
Furthermore , I love children very much , the reason can be such fact that I have three younger brothers and one younger sister , so I am the older one .
However , I have no experience working with children , apart from helping my parents with brothers and sister .
But in dance area I have a lot of achievements , such as victories in different competitions and festivals .
I am very active and creative person with desire to work .
And of course , as required , I can speak English quite well and have a certificate that shows it .
In my point of view , my candidacy is enough suitable for this job , because I am young person , that has all required skills and a lot of energy to work .
When I was in school I used to go to my granparents ' home to have lunch because my parents were at work , I fondly remember my gandma 's great cooking skills that she still owns to this day .
Those years I was very familiar with the smell of cheese burguers , BBQ pizzas and also kebabs .
By the time my high school years were done , and right when I attended university , I developed certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish , unavoidibly combined with less fast food due to the usual diners with friends .
The main cause of that change was that I had to have breakfast , lunch and dinner at my college dorm 's dining room that had amazingly good cooks , They 'd cook really good dishes such as cocido , garbanzos and paella .
If all of used cars , the levels of pollution would be incredibly high .
Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport , especially trains as they use electricity and are less pollutant than other means of transport .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadays and only the use of public transport can make a significant difference in the quality of life in our cities .
If those who run public transportation systems hope to make them greener in the future , they 'll have to come with solutions that are both energy efficient and effective .
My first degree gave me a good track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student and as a research fellow , allowed me to build a scientific thinking .
Furthermore , I have improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformatics and microscopic techniques , and I also would like to point up my high motivation to develop expertise in stem cells and pharmaceutical research .
I am interested in the English Course in which I can learn at my own pace .
First of all , I consider very important to learn a second language and English is a very used one around the world .
In addition to that , I am graduated in Computer Science and there is a lot of information available in this language .
Finally , I have interest in technology , environment and science .
I live in a small village , in the German region of Hesse , called Griesheim .
- One for the paper ;
- One for the bio waste ; and ,
- One for the waste that can not be recycled .
In addition , yellow plastic bags are provided for free to separate the plastic , cans and bricks .
The cost of the waste disposal service depends only on the volume of non - reciclable waste produced .
There are also public conainers for glass and clothes all around the village .
Eventually , the citizen becomes part of a very meticulous recycling process by looking up to the cost .
On the other hand , the city provides a punctual public transport system , very convenient .
Trams are available 24 hours and tram stops are evenly distributed ; it takes no more than 8 minutes walking from one stop to the next one .
To ride is another suitable option , if the weather allows .
He would only drag himself out of his house when he heard a new type of food was created .
Jack lived with his mommy , he had no job , and when she had told him to be independent , he only lasted one month before going on poverty .
He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law on banning new types of food , this had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes .
One day before this new law was established , a crazy scientist created a new waffle , " the great , furry waffle .
" This was an incentive for Jack to go out , he was sure that destiny had rewarded him with this blessing because he had eaten ten hot dogs in a row , although he felt a bit sick after , he knew it was worth the try .
There was a bit of conflict in his plan , the new waffle was in Texas , and he lived in Washington .
He saw on his mommy 's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle , he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips .
Jack bought a ticket to the earliest flight to Texas , once he got off the plane he ran through the landscape .
He liked the trend of everyone being fat in America , that way he could fit in .
The scientist gave him " the great , furry waffle " and a bunch of syrup .
Jack grabbed it and put it in his mouth , he could taste heaven in his mouth .
In a matter of seconds nothing he fell to the ground , choking .
Suddenly , a giant fish fell from the sky , causing him spit out the hairball , Jack could not believe what he saw , the man riding the fish was Bugs Bunny !
Jack finally lost weight and lived happily ever after , the end .
Have you ever stopped to think that exist some standards in the society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow , and those directly reflect the values of the Brazilian culture .
One of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to the vocal patterns .
When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about the African American Communication , but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time .
Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , there are some facts about the extremes of it .
First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time , without they have clear reasons .
It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
Surprisingly , on the other hand , a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule , and can be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian culture , if during a conversation a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking .
In both the extremes of a speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of a good communication .
Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns .
As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal territory .
And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person .
In some countries like the United States , whose respect of personal territory is extremely important , the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and the touching ( Edward T. Hall ) .
In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S.
Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are no tolerant with strangers invading it .
Soon , even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others .
For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact , and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
According to article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazil , the eye contact is primordial , being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to .
The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's attention , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others ' opinion .
After being socially judged by the society , we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules in our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them .
In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication .
Also , the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values .
Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts .
In addition , you should avoid judge cultural values from other countries based on unwritten rules of your own .
It was a rainy Monday afternoon and Michael was gazing out the window thinking about his life , when he saw his friend , John , dashing through the street .
- I 'm late for my piano lesson ! I really have to go , see you later - John replied panting .
Michael had a chemestry test the next day , however he was n't in the mood to study and so he decided to call Alex , his best friend :
- To be perfectly honest I do n't really like it there !
what about the one next to the shopping center ?
- Souds great .
Michael grabbed his coat and creept out of his house in order not to wake up his parents .
He remembered that he still had n't studied for his chemestry test .
According to Ferguson et all ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the exercise .
Nevertheless , a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Thus , the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life .
Importantly , it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production .
Nevertheless , the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly .
Finally , it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing the blood pressure .
Despite the present findings , it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By this action , athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life .
Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher , I have some more knowledge about this subject than any other people because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day .
To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge .
Of course , I make use of computer and projector during my teaching daily , because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children .
After all , my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated .
The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide .
Without teachers ' guidance , self- studying may bring some problems to children , such as possible misunderstanding .
Networking educational contents are not safe at all .
It is common for children to watch violence scenes .
Nowadays , young people graduate from universities , who come up with new and innovative ideas about educational process and so the tradition will be updated next years .
To be more precise , new educational methods promotes the students ' teamwork .
In other words , students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematic problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves .
In this kind of education , teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people .
This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems .
My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the education process .
This is a good option especially during the summer time .
Also this is a healthy way of getting fit .
One of these is athleticism . "
Campo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athleticism professionally .
You can practise it in a semi- Olympic swimming pool , which is always clean and protected against the sunlight .
I strongly recommend young people to choose sports in which you can take part of a team .
This experience would teach you how to work with different kind of people .
Dear Mr Michael Wallis ,
Thank you so much for this opportunity , I am very grateful for everything .
I think English is in fact very important because first of all although not being the most spoken language in the world , it is the official language in a large number of countries .
Most of the content produced on the internet ( 50% ) is in English and last but not least although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time , we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities .
About the accommodation , we talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English speaking families because of what a great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills .
I was actually about to email you about the activities that are to be planned .
Regarding the students preferences , they all love the outdoors , like parks and rivers and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge .
All in all , anything that will keep them away from being bored and with nothing to do .
Concerning this amazing trip I only have two questions left starting with the weather , considering your experience with the changes happening this time of the year and the second and last about what type of clothes you recommended which is of great importance primarily for our female students .
On the positive side , travelling by car is more relaxed because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you .
Actually you have more freedom in which roads to choose and you can have breaks whenever you feel a need for some time off the street .
Going by train for example , you need to get to the next train station and afterwards from the destination train station to your target .
Often enough you have to rely on other services such as busses or taxis to reach your destination .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas , electricity and other materials is a lot lower per head .
Furthermore you have the chance to take a nap , do some work or watch TV while you are being transported .
Moreover you can be lucky to avoid big traffic jams especially if you are taking the train .
Avoiding traffic jams , construction sites , accidents and other obstacles you may being affected by may result in a lower amount of time spent travelling .
As a conclusion you can say public transport will have its use even in the future . While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time , the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary .
It is popularly believed that the golden era of public transportation will be ended soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and vans .
On the other hand , travelling by car is getting for popular than it ever was with development of science and technology .
People who are based on rural and remote areas are always prefer to use public transportation according to the researchers from Columbia University .
However , in some countries , public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly , this is one of the main reasons which had led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation .
Not only people in countries where it has poor public transportation but also the most developed countries , there is a high tendency of using cars instead of depending on public transportation .
Despite the fact that using cars being expensive , many people still prefer to use their own vehicles because it saves their valuable time .
Public transportation , on the other hand , consumes a lot of time to travel from one distance to another .
Higher power efficiency and linearity cause decrease power consumption , increase lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
Class - E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain theoretically 100% power efficiency . Class - E power amplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency theoretically .
However in practice there are some limitations such as , switch on - resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .
Secret agents have often been chosen as the main character of stories and films , such as James Bond 's ones , which managed to be really successful .
There could be a lot of reasons , like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret ; but in real life , what kind of person does a secret agent have to be ?
In the same way a secret agent has to be able to take risks when required .
Therefore bravery is very important : nobody needs a fearful spy .
A secret agent works undercover , so his most important quality is possessing great skill in lying .
I am writing in order to express my disappointment about your musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I saws the show 's advertisement hanging up of a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends . I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good references about your Company and , above all , about the main star , Danny Brook .
The problems started in the box office , where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement , and the man who was selling the tickets said that they did n't exist .
On the other hand , the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons .
You promised a perfect evening but it became a big disastrous !
I would like some kind of explanation and receive my money back .
If you do n't agree , I will act consequently .
She began to read " Dear Carolin ..
There was only a person who used to call her by this name .
When they were saying goodbye Paul " I will be the last person who will kiss you " . " It sounds nice but I do n't believe it " she replied .
" You only have to wait " he said .
At this moment Carole was living with her husband but they did n't love each other any more .
Her friend Pat had explained the whole story at her husband .
What she would do ?
I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about ' Over the rainbow ' in the hotel which I stayed .
Secondly , starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waited for 45 minutes .
It was so long time to wait in the theatre .
Despite of the fact that I am a student , I could not get any discounts .
I also visited your restaurant after the show but already closed because the show finished late .
Because of the reason above , I , indeed , spent awful last night in London .
I would like you to refund , otherwise , I will take an action .
I look forward to receiving reply to my enquiry .
People will wear this kind of clothes 100 years later from now .
If weather is hot then we do n't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies .
There will be two functions for summer clothes that we do n't need to wear clothes like layer and layer .
For example , T - shirts for women are included bra : easy to take it out when you wash it , is very simple and comfortable .
We ca n't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it .
When it 's very cold winter , we just wear light clothes what we want , in our style .
Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and use them inside thin clothes so we do n't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies .
We can show our body line in winter as well .
Most important thing is that we do n't have to kill the animals only for people 's cruel aims .
Functions ' clothes are the way to love animals !
I WANT TO THAK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US TO THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH .
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH . IT CONSISTS ON VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IN THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL .
I THINK IT 'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE .
ON THE OTHER HAND , WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL .
I WILL BE WRITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR RESPONSE .
FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS , FILM STARS , ETC ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION .
AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS , THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ACT IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES , WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS .
AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND OF INFORMATION , JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS , FOR EXAMPLE , CHASING THEIR CARS , TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAYS .
THIS SITUATION AFFECTS FAMOUS PERSONAL LIVES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE PRIVACY
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT , ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FAMOUS , THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS AND FANS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME , AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE FAMOUS RIGHT TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIVES IN SECRET .
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT IN SOME CASS , COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY .
Personally , I enjoy looking and learning about new inventions and all the science .
However , my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show . We are attracted to this show and would like to go .
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening .
Apparently , this show is free to all students , which means if we went , the cost of the trip will be cut down .
We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on .
For one , the future homes might not be built out of bricks at all !
Also , due to global warming , sea levels might rise and risk of flooding will also rise .
Dear Mrs. Jane Clark ,
Recently I was at the annual international arts festival , that you organized .
I 'm writing this letter to thank you for giving a possibility to know more about modern art .
I think , it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year , because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries .
Unfortunately , only six countries were represented this year at the festival , but I hope that soon there would be much more of them .
I extremely liked all concerts , shows , exhibitions , but why there were n't any photograph exhibitions ?
I think , you should make some next year .
Then , I want to mark , that concert halls were too small , that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts .
Then , I want to say , that plays and films were exellent , but it was n't enough of them for me .
May be you should make more next year ?
And at the end , my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea , because you do n't have to stay in queues to buy a ticket for a show , you want to go to .
You asked , if there are some school rules in my country .
As you know , I 'm studying at the private Academy , so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes . I 'll give you an example .
In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke .
The fine for smoking on the Academy is territory is 100 dollars .
Well , I have rather modern parents , so they do n't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends .
The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day .
Look forward to hearing from you ,
I was to Circle Theatre to watch ' Over the rainbow ' musical show , recently .
I was trully dissapointed by it .
My expectations were high after I 've read your leaflet in which it was advertised as ' London 's newest and best musical show ' .
Secondly , I had to wait fourty - five minutes before the show finally began .
Another unkept promise are the discounts .
Lastly , when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant is closed . You can believe me it was n't ' my perfect evening out ' and I have no other choice than asking to give my money back .
I 'd like you to send the money to this adress ; ul Taklowa 10
Yours sincerely ,
After two days the whole school knew .
What are you dong here , why are n't you at school ? '
Paul was like paralyzed .
I had heard what you 've said about me ' , she said , I think it 's sweet ' .
All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat is n't that bad at all .
Dear Helen Ryan
It is a dream becames true and was really unexpected for me !
I would like to travel on July because of it is more suitable for me .
I think I will really enjoy if I could stay in tents it is going to be a new experience and looks exciting .
About the activities while at the Camp I would like to enjoy swimming , not because I am good in it , just because I keen on and the other one is Photography .
As I never did this in whole my life could you tell me if we have to do our own meals or I can find everything ready to eat there ?
If no , what do you sugest ?
How much I have to get in my pocket ?
I hope has had your questions out of your mind .
Last month , I enjoyed to help at a pop concert in Portugal .
Everything were new for me .
I had to ( lyd ) tidy up the place where they have to wait until their turn .
The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for throat .
Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels , I mean , dried towels because as you know that country is too hot , especially for my liking , as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh ; do n't ask me why .
The pop concert happened in a big stadium called " Mararcanã " .
I just did not enjoyed when they were making the instruments work for the big day .
But what I particularly liked was see and ask autographs from the rest of the others groups .
The festival was excenent in many ways , and especially it being an international festival was a challenging , but brilliant idea .
I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with proper price to come to the festival .
The festival was supposed to be an international one , but the artists and stars participated in it were from six countries only .
Also , some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences .
Furthermore , I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays .
So I suggest you have various kinds , and more numbers of plays and films next year .
I hope that next year 's festival will be much more successful that this year 's one .
Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones .
Above all , realistic stories teach me something of the life , or at least influence me .
Here , the fishman is very old , but he is still challenging to everything he faces .
When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship , he never gave up taking it back to his village , even when sharks were around him .
So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught , I got very angry and annoyed .
I was very disappointing a week holiday for me because I had got a lot of problem with the show .
I had seen the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it was not Danny Brook .
I was really disappointing because he is my famous actor .
The musical should started at 19.30 , but it started at 20.15 .
When I went to asked for the discount of ticket in the cashier desk they told me no discount available for this .
I had seen the advertisement say that discount available .
After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant , but I could n't because it closed .
This was not perfect evening for me , so if you do n't give my money back , I will tell to the newspaper about it .
I am looking forward to hear a good new .
Yours sincerely ,
I think in the next 100 years people will wear the space clothes with small engine in the back . because of the atmosphere .
The atmosphere in the earth now starting badly every years .
The carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut more trees , therefore not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen .
The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes .
I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars , ships , planes and space ships .
This mean the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it , so it must useful in the future .
I think somebody will make a very big area to grow plant because they can sell the oxygen .
This is a new business .
I think I can win this price , because this clothe will produce in the future soon .
MY NAME JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT .
FIRST OF ALL ON THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAYS THAT THE ACTOR WAS GOING TO BE DANNY BROOK AND INSTEAD OF HIM WAS A TOTALLY UNKNOWN CLOWN THAT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW TO ACT , IT WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING !
SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30 , AND I GOT HEAVILY MAD WHEN I LOOK MY WATCH AND NOTICE THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 ( FORTY ) MINUTES AND THE SHOW DIDN'T START YET ... I MEAN I WAS AMAIZING !
THEN I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT , DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE , AND I DIDN'T GOT ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM .
AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX , AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I COULDN'T BELIVE IT HOW THIS CLASS OF THEATRE CAN BE SO ..
OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE LAST THING , IT WAS THE HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER GOT SO I DEMEND FOR MY MONEY BACK !
I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS .
MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECT ME IN SEVERAL WAYS , I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZES ; MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET .
NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME , IF I'AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HADN'T IT YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVEOVEN .
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE COMPUTERS , I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINE IN THE WORLD , YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT , BY JUST USING THE INTERNET , IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME IN MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK , I MEAN IT 'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WAIST BY MAKING THING WITHOUT A COMPUTER .
BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE ,
THIS CAN BE BAD TO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BE CONFORTABLE WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORKS I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM .
1th , June , 2000
I am writing to reply your letter and I am so glad to win the prize .
In answer your questions : I would like to travel in July .
Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping .
My Dad is an amateur painter , and I have begun painting for 8 years .
I would also like to play golf during my holiday , but I have never played it before , will I get any tuition ?
How is the weather like in California in July ?
Our lives are getting better and better , so people began to go shopping more frequently .
It 's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases , but is it doing us good apart from the temporary satisfaction ?
Everyone likes sale , but those so - called sale items are not really of value .
In fashion industry , sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time , because those owners want to make room for new stock .
But you 'll find your ' cool bargain ' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones .
Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit .
Therefore , we become impulsive buyers easily under these tricks .
The result , we feel guilty after spending more than we 've estimated , or even suffer from financial difficulty .
Shopping does not just effect us mentally , but also physically .
I do n't think anyone would really like to face them .
Well , now before you go shopping , think again and you 'll find out it wo n't be always enjoyable .
I 'm a person , went to see the musical show , I would like to know something about " Over the rainbow " programme ?
You have informed the actor , times , discount and the restaurant to people , but actually what did you do ?
The first , you have changed the actor .
The second , the time is late from 19.30 , it started 20.15 .
The third , the tickets have not the discount .
The last , after show , I could n't go to the restaurant , because it was closed .
This is the good theatre do , or not ?
This is the famous theatre .
Everybody attented go to the show , funny , and happ in the end , and what have we go then ?
Disapponted !
Thank about that .
If you can not managed the programe , why did you informe people before programe start ?
I tought you inderstood ' ; please send money back to me , you know why , do n't answer me ?
Now we know , our world have developed to new world , becase we have high technology to do .
If we came back to the past , we felt everything , it was so difficult to do , we would have plane and done by ourself and last time .
In the present , the teachnology is a past of life .
It started from got up in the morning , we have the machine help us to cook , iron , cleanning , washing , and then we went out to work , there are car , sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly .
While we worked at the office , there are the computer and equipment for help to work and easy , after we have finished work , we come back home , there are television for get information , news , data by different way and quickly .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
We appreciated the mordern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly , we have time to do many things .
Regarding the programme you have organised , it is great ideas everything that you have planed , but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement .
It is good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning , we can se all famous buildings in a few hours .
It 's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river .
The idea about going to science museum is fantastic , I read about the museum , it is really interesting in science history .
After all morning in the Museum , it is wonderful and on tuesday doing some shops , whereas the student have another idea for tuesday .
On Wednesday after viseted national Art Gallery , we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon .
The advertisement that students saw is about a fashion show , but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show , because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Yours faithfully ,
Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and television is private life of famous people .
It is really interesting how people like knowing famous people life .
Without someone famous know , photographs take pictures secretly , try to get money on it .
Sometimes being famous can get stress , everywhere they go there are people around them , especially journalists , trying to ask millions questions .
Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want , but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places , because nobody like famous politicians or film stars without asking questions .
On the whole , to be rich and famous do n't always bring happeness , whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago .
First of all that evening there was not Danny Brook but an unknown and not very good actor .
Then at the tickets - office I was said that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full prize despite I am a student .
Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not been already closed because the show finished , obviously , late .
I am really not satisfied with the show - organization particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something different .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't good at keeping secret .
Last week we had another demostration of this .
On Monday we decided to organize a surprise - party for Ted 's birthday on Tuesday evening .
Anna prepared the cake , Peter organized the music , Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK I 'll phone to some of Ted 's friends to invite them " .
Obviously Ted should have known nothing about it and we remembered it to Pat twice : " the party is a secret ! ! " and she said : " Yes , it must be a surprise ! "
On Tuesday afternoon we met to prepare the last details ; Pat said : " I 've just phoned to Tommy , Billy and Alison and I met Ted yesterday evening : they all have said ok for the party .. "
In that moment she understood that something was wrong !
Thank you for organising good programme , especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days .
I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give the information of ' The London Fashion And Leisure Show ' which we would like to go and to huggest our opinion .
We have seen an advertisement of last Saturday ' The Times ' edition of the show .
It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall , London or Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Firstly , it will introduce latest fashions connecting Millenium .
Secondly , we will be able to see leisure and sports wear about fashion trend of next year .
It would be fantastic opportunity to the students who study a fashion .
Finally , we can see how to make up and make better hairstyle in the show .
Most of all , It is free for students to enter .
Whenever I recollet it , I feel self - confident .
When I was twenty years old , I had to go to Army .
However , instead of going to Army , I was able to apply to Korea Auxiliary Police .
Suddenly , the theft signal came into .
When we arrived at the place which it happened , one man started running away .
When I said to my mother , she asked me not to do it again .
But , I was a police - man .
I am writing to replay your letter and to ask more details about the competition .
Firstly , I would like to say that I 'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition .
As you asked in the letter , I would like to travel only on july because I work at the central library and I 'm also having English classes , so I will just have holidays on July .
Is it suitable for you ?
As you mentioned about the accomodation , I would prefer stay in the tents , because it 's more exciting and I really love camping .
I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to chose just two of them because in my opinion I 'm good in almost of this activities .
However , I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and it 's misteries and I also like the watter , the wind in my face ...
The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I 'm tall and very fast with the ball .
Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes are we supposed to wear there , and about the money we are supposed to pay for food and things like that .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay .
Last month , I went to a pop concert with four bands .
It was unbelivebly ! ! !
Although it was 5.000 thousand people there , people could walk and dance without any problem .
It was very well organised , the shows started in the exactly time and the group were well performed too .
I have contributed to the concert selling some tickets to my friends .
However the success of the concert , at the end of show some full gays started a big confusion and some people get hurt .
Finally , I would like to know some news about you , What have you done ?
Be you studing a lot ?
Dear Helen Ryan ;
I have just received your letter which is made me so hapy . I can not belive that I won first prize in your competition , because I always belived I am an unluky man and now I think somethings are changing in my life .
I would like to come in July , because I am studying English and we have one month break at July , so please make my log cabin ready by july .
I prefer stay in cabin because I have some experience with tents from my childhood and it was not very good experience therefore I would like to stay in cabin .
You saying in your letter I could do two activities from the list which is show many exciting activities .
I will definitly chose Basketball and Swimming wich are the my dream sport .
I used to be play in school team when I was in high school and our team was the one of the best Basketball team in all county and I also very good at swim .
I would like to ask a few things , specialy wheather : how is the weather in July in the U.S.A. What kind of clothes I will need and how much money I should take with me , Because I have never been U.S.A. before and I do n't know anything
I am looking forward to your reply letter .
Your sincerely
I have never enjoyed doing shopping , but nowday some people are calling shopcholic .
They are just like alcholics and this people are every day doing shopping because they can not stop themself unless they have not got money for spend .
I can not believe how they doing this things every day , even when I need something at home I alway try to find out something to use instead of that things .
Because nowdays whereever you go there is big queue and I hate being waited .
The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is parking problem , if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you wo n't be alway luky to find a seat to seat .
If you go shopping for ( buy ) clothes that is the worse kind of shopping .
Specialy if you want to buy with your girlfriend or if you are already girl you have to be read for hours to spend try on and off .
I realy hate go shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they went into a shop they want try on every single cloth and they do not realise to time .
Some people says " shopping is not alway enjoyable " but for me definity unenjoyable and I think it will be same rest of my life .
I hoped that it would be the most excited evening during my week 's holiday in London .
First of all , when I had bought the ticets it appeared that there is no discount available .
Secondly , I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone did n't excuse .
Moreover I would like to ask why Danny Brook , which is my favourite actor , did n't play in the show .
Furthermore I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed .
Your faithfully
I wish I had know it two days ago ... Exacly on 15th June we were at the birthday party .
It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us .
Yesterday I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony .
The most horrible is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I do n't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties .
Mr. Manager :
I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your Musical show I had a very bad time .
Firstly when I went to the show it was writing that the starting time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight I had waitted for fourthey five minutes .
It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too .
And as last that was the worse night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they would n't give it so I had an argument with the people Who worked their but I could n't get my money back .
Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school some one came next to me and I noticed that it was Pat .
She said that she would n't tell it to anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I always was with her very minute ever second .
But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat at the front of our house door talking to my dad .
I just knew I could n't have trusted to her but as I went in the house my dad offered pot to stay for meal I was in a schock thinking why is n't anyone getting angry to me after a while we sat for dinner and Pat just talk my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry .
I could n't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and ca n't keep any secrets .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment : " Over the Rainbow " .
As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland , we apreciate to pass a week in London every year .
We are keen on theatre and musical show .
Your theatre is known to present excellent spectacles .
We were never disappointed so far and especially enjoyed " The Drama " you presented last year .
At first , we could n't get any discount , although you mention it on your advertisment .
And the only tickets left were at £ 20 .
Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned .
Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it 's good price value but also for it 's original decoration .
Therefore I ask you to give use £ 20 back , because the two tickets were not more worth .
I 'm looking forward to hearing soon from you .
My husband was following a course all the week in Berne .
The kids were by their grandmother , who take care of them .
I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink .
It was so hot , I decided to go for a swim in tutry , although I had n't any swimming - clothes .
I parked the car and went ten minuts .
As I had planed , the place was deserted .
I took my clothes of and swam twenty minutes in the lake .
I walked back , hoping I would n't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home .
They drove me to their office after having given me use of their shirt .
I felt so miserable that Pat laughed seeing me .
I am writing to thank you for providing International Arts Festival .
It was absolutely great idea .
Firstly , could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries ?
In my opinion , it might be better to have time with variety nationallites .
Secondly , the music concerts were very exciting and had a lot of fun , but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably .
Thirdly , I am expecting to watch more films and plays which were impressive .
Lastly , it could be nice to students who are interested in arts , if you help special events , for instance , song contest , writing competition or dance lessons .
To sum up , I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably - priced ticket like this year 's .
PART TIME JOBS : Find in your place
If you do , make sure why you want to earn money .
That is very important to find a way for earning and saving money .
Probably the best way you can get money is to have a part time job in your spare time .
I am recommending you to check your possible time to work - weekdays or weekend ? - before you request a job .
If you just decide to work , you 'd better to find a job in your place .
Secondly , as your family or friends .
As they know about your interestings and personality , it is easy to help you .
In my case , I could get a telephone researcher part by my friend 's reference .
In conclusion , do n't forget that a job is just spent in your " spare " time .
As it is said in your advertisement , the show is starring Danny Brook but there was different actor .
It is not the only problem .
The show had to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
You promised that there will be discounts , but when I came , I found out , that they were not available .
I invited a friend of mine and promised her that we will go there .
You promised that if we go to your show we will have a perfect evening .
Everything was just vice versa .
I am very disappointed , that is why I am asking you for compensation .
It happened at the end of school year .
My class was going to a night disco and I wanted to go there too .
I tried to persuade them , told that nothing will happen to me , promised to do all housework .
But all they have done is told me that I am to young for it and I can go there only when I am 20 years old .
I had such a desire to go to the disco , that I decided to go even without parent 's permission .
I told my secret to my best friend Pat .
But she told it to very kid in school , even the teachers heard it .
It occured that one of the teachers told my parents about it .
At the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks .
I understood that I must keep my secrets and do not tell anybody , even the best friend .
I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been .
I think should be bigger for jazz , rock or still classical concerts .
Secondly , I had some ideas for the next year events , such as :
- Funny plays and films to spend the break time ;
- Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night ,
- Art exbitions to know more things about artist 's lifestyle ; and
- talks by writers to say how good is his latest book .
In addictions , the ticket 's price is too expensive and difficult to buy another one every day , so , I think is more effective if was one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events .
In conclusion , I hope will be better next year if these points was observed for the each year the event to be better than before .
It was nice to receive notices about you .
I remember these time in our class when us talking many time about rules and I am missing that time so much .
Well , about rules in my contry , is not different than another countries .
The rules must be respect for all people if you do n't want get out from scholl .
You must to be organise , clean and respect the right of other people ..
Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre ,
First of all , the actor was different from your advertisement .
I meant he was not Danny Brook .
Secondly , it took times to wait about forty five minutes , because it started at 20:15 .
Due to being a student , I think I should have got the discount from your ticket with ID card .
Besides this , the theatre restaurant was early closed .
As soon as the show ended , I went to there for having a dessert .
I look forward to replying from you .
It was so close to be on his birthday , so we made a decision to hold a small party for him .
She has just learnt with us for three weeks .
She is not talkative , kind , and reserved .
However , this party she took part in , she was responsible for preparing food .
As far as we knew , she 's good at cooking .
While she was choosing vegetables in a market , she came across him .
When he asked her ' why do you choose deliberately ? ' , she answered without thinking .
That caused the secret disclosed .
We did n't blame her , because we knew that she did n't intend to do like that .
But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries , not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement .
Secondly I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls .
Thirdly , all the plays and films showed were interesting , In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year .
Finally , I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them .
I look forward hearing from you .
Your sincerely
As you tell me in your last letter you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home .
First I must tell you that teachers are strict at school .
We are n't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks .
At home everything is quite good , mum and dad are great but there 's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I 'll come back .
Granny is the problem she 's a bit bossy !
She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I do n't care about it .
Especially I believe that the visit to the National Art Gallery will be a really exciting experience for all of us .
However , some of them have read an advertisment about the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March .
The Exhibition will show all the latest fashion in a very wide range from sports wear to make up and even hairstyles .
What is more , the show is free for all the students .
We feel that taking part to it would be a great opportunity to us since we will be able to have some information about the world of fashion , which is becoming more and more important in our days .
Under the circumstances , I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it could be possible to make some changes in the programme if it could to visit the Exhibition .
It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm , so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon .
Yours faithfully
Being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes .
But not always famous people are happy of their condition .
Usually if you ask them what they would desire most , the answer is : " I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do "
There is no surprise to this answer : famous people can not have their own private life .
They can not even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph .
But the worst thing of all is that they are often victim of malicious gossips , which most of the times are not even true .
In conclusion , I believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings , on the other hand , however , I think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have .
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed : not always , in fact , money and celebrity being happiness .
Thank you for the programme which you have organised the three days in London .
The show is opened between ten and seven p.m on Tuesday , March 14 at Central Exhibition Hall in London .
Latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles are expected to be displayed and studied .
We have concerned it as a great opportunity to touch a part of latest cultures , which are concentrated and sharpened in London .
In addition , the addmission for students is free .
Taking the programme and the show into consideration , we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday .
We suppose that in free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping .
Yours sincerily ,
It is no doubt that functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation , for example , have been .
Thinking about the home of the future , first of all , nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies , which make house - keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for convenient life .
People may tend to avoid from living in a large number of families in an expected small house in a city .
On the other hand , the bond between parents and children should be unlikly to change .
The longer and further they live on their own , the more they may feel that they need a family .
New materials will surly change the home of the future in any ways .
It is just staff 's around us improving and turning into new one .
Hopefully , the minds of people will stay peaceful and tender in the future .
First I would like to mention that I can only travel in July , because I will work in August in a web designer studio .
So I am unable to go on holiday to another time .
I am rather good in it .
I also had Painting as main subject at school for five years .
I like painting very much , and I think I am good in Painting .
I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy - pictures .
Which clothes should we take with us ?
First I would like to point out , that this was a good idea to present our school in a short film .
I think first of all we should film an english lesson , where pupils could prepare some group work or information - boards .
I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson , maybe the pupils could write " offers and orders " or enquiries on the blackboard .
This subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations .
They go together in groups , then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers .
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake .
The smokers in the school yard , the buffett and the other pupils , who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework .
I think then we should film an informatic - lesson .
It would be funny to present the computers , which are often overcharged , or often the netserver is spinning .
It 's really funny to see the helpless teacher , who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text , while the computers do not work or brake down .
In my opinion this are the most interesting things in our school .
I am writing to complain about your entertainment which was advertised in the last edition of " Plays " .
I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I suspected to meet .
First of all , the prices were n't lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that .
Especially I was disappointed by Danny Brook who made me nervous with his lack of talent .
According to your advertisement , there was a possibility to have dinner in your restaurant , but I was surprised when I found it closed .
After that , I should also mention , that this evening was dull , boring and the worst in my life .
I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once .
Come back to paradise
There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject , but what can be designed more ?
Can you imagine the trend which will be as shocking as it has never been ?
The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality .
Nowadays it 's getting obvious that designers sold only details , but significant changes do n't turn up .
Styles mix , colours and shapes come back from the past , only the fabrics are different .
People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time . Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common clothes .
That 's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit the boredome I am sure that at last we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there wo n't be any problem with being up - do - date .
As it was previously stated I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important will be body and purity of our soul .
Although the show was supposed to be the London 's newest and best musical show , I am rather disappointed with it .
However , you changed actors without informing viewers .
As if this were not enough , the show was forty five minutes late .
According to your leaflet , tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper , but I was refused being given a discount .
You can imagine how disappointed I must be to spent such an imperfect evening .
I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this mater further .
Recently , we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives .
Thanks to computers , phones , mobile phones , internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before .
My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year .
But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean .
I also enjoy shopping through internet .
This way I do n't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes .
First of all , I spend too much time indoors playing computer or watching TV . I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy , I must take up some sport .
That 's why we should abandon cars from city centres , closed down factories which produce too much sewage .
Although modern progress has made our life easier , it may be also harmful .
We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably .
I am writing to answer all the questions that you made me in your last letter .
It is very important for me , because I always wanted to travel to the U.S.A.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because as I had never slept in a tent , it would be a new experience for me .
By the other side , I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it .
I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take .
I look forward to knowing the date of the camp .
I read it and found it very good , specially , Science Museum and National Art Gallery as I am interested in arts .
Students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
I thing it is a great opportunity for us , as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students .
Girls should like to see the latest fashion , new make - up and interesting hairstyles .
Boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear .
I hope you will consider this proposition and I am looking forward to hearing form you .
We like our houses that is why are always trying to make it more comfortable and useful .
I think The Home of the Future will be bigger as we will need more room for us , our belongings and interests .
The construction will be more simple what will give us a feeling of balance .
More houses will have gardens what will make us feel closer to the nature .
Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen which is a useless place , as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside .
Because of computers we will have the possibility of working at home , therefore , home will be very important place worth paying attention .
I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show " Over The Rainbow . "
Unfortunately , I had a very disappointing evening , because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided .
Secondly , in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30 .
Thirdly , it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated , seing they were not available .
As you can see , most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided .
We did not have " a perfect evening " as it was written , actually we had an evening full of the theatre 's mistakes and were extremely disappointed .
I suppose it will be better for your theatre 's reputation to give at least some of my money back .
Yours Sincerely ,
If I were to talk about my own life , my speech would be simple : " My electronic alarm - clock wakes me up in the morning .
In my spare time , I watch television , play with my computer , or chat in the internet ... " There is no sentence without electronic devices .
I have friends in the internet and can learn anything while surfing in it .
My daily life is programmed up to the virtual world I created .
I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held 21st and 22nd November .
I went to the rock concert by U2 and the Chinese film " Chung King Express " .
Both of them were not only really enjoyable , but also reasonably - priced .
First of all , it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities .
Because most of them were from English speaking country this year .
I think they are the nearest ' arts ' in real life .
I would be glad if you consider my suggestions .
Money - hasn't it always been one of the most important problem for students ?
Of course , you ca n't afford a luxualy car and a large apartment unless you 've born with a silver spoon .
Not only it 's a simple job , but also you can enjoy working with many colleague at your age .
It would be great fan to make friends outside your class or club .
If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction , why do n't you teach younger students as a private teacher .
It 's also really popular job among university students because of the good salaly .
Stop complaining about lack of money and let 's start working to have a new world .
Dir Madam
I was really suprised when I opened it .
I look forword to going to the Camp California in the USA .
I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me on August and I will have to look after them .
I prefer staying in tens to staying in log cabins .
Because it remainds me my childhood . I used to going with my friends to the camp , wich was situeded on a seaside .
We had always enjoying ourselves .
Never had I got such a great time .
From your 's list of activities I choose sailing and climbing .
I find it very atractive .
I have been sailing since my father had bought a boat in 1980 , when I was only five years old .
I would like to ask what kinds of clothes should I take with me . and I wonder if prizes are high there .
I used to like shopping , but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity .
Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want .
Nowdays we have many big shopping centers .
We like them because everything is on one place .
The most suitable time for shopping is weekand when parents do n't work and children haven't got a school .
Because of that shopping centers are over crowded .
You ca n't buy something in peacful and calm athmospher .
In addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high , of course not all of them .
However such centers are very useful and necessary .
I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is extremly hugh queu to the changing room .
Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable .
If you bought something goregous , you would be very happy .
On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have bad mood do n't go shopping .
First of all , I want to thank you in the name of the class for your good organisation and programme , Especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time .
The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March , from 10 oo to 19 oo o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall .
There will be shown the latest fashions about leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
This is a great opportunity for us , because we haven't been ever before in this kind of show .
As well as this , the entrance for students is free .
Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy there something .
Yours sincerelly
The man is a being that need to live close to other human beings and to create a society around him .
This is also important to him as friendship and family
The yellow press is searching for every little information they can get .
The photographers are chasing these people , just to take a picture of them on how they eat or with who the meat .
The photos will be on tomorrow 's press and so rumours are born .
On the other hand the people have choose to walk on this path .
The price for fame and money is the lost of privacy .
First of all you have to give up something for getting something else .
As well as this , the stars should n't complaint at any time about their fans and their lost of privacy .
They wanted to be famous and the had known the price before .
I 'm writing to you because of the musical show " Over the rainbow " , wich I visited on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre .
There are several points I have to complain wich made the evening not nice at all .
At first the show started much later than it was written out .
Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight . I could n't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons , the first one is that there was no information how much time the start of the show is going to be late .
The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month .
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook , who was the reason why I went into the show had been traded by an other actor , who could n't sing as half as good then Brook .
On your ticket information is written out that discounts are available , when I ask at the ticket reception I could n't get any discount for beeng student .
To make an result the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like promised .
For these reasons I want to ask you to get my money of £ 25 back .
reasently
He did n't want to say what Sarah just had told him , it just came over his mouth , when he talked to James .
But Pat made a promise not to tell anybody about the quiz show and he already had told enough .
After one hour the hohle class had heard about Sarah 's secret .
Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told in a secret to them .
Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class , when she turned around a talking and wispering started .
Suddenly , she went to Pat and asked him did you tell anybody about our secret .
Sarah looked at him for a while , than she stood in front of the class and explaind to the others , that she won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the sea of southern France and everybody of the 19 pupils was invited , except Pat who was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show " over the Rainbow " you presented the 10 of this month .
I read your advertissement five days before , and I was realy impressed by it .
But , the quality of this show was n't what you let understand , an I feel realy disappointed by it .
First of all , you presented a starring composed with Danny Brook , but he was n't there !
Then , I am a student , and when I bought my ticket , there was n't any discounts .
Finally , I hoped that I could have a diner in the restaurant after the show , but , to make my totally disappointed , it was closed , and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00 .
So you can imagine how I am satisfied by your pretending " Perfect Evening " .
For all these reasons , and if you want to keep me a costumer , I would be gratfull if you give me some or all my money back .
Yours sincerly ,
My marks was n't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science , and the exam session was finished .
There was no solutions to finally obtain the diploma .
You need more explanations about me to understand my motivations at the end of this story .
In fact , I did this kind of studies because of my interests in programming .
The problem is that I ca n't keep calm during an exam to succeed .
That 's why I decided to hack the teacher 's computers to change all my marks .
I never talked about this project to anyone , exept my best friend Pat .
At the end of the exam session , all students and teachers meet together for a big party , to celebrate it .
Then , the teachers made copies of their file , and my project was n't possible anymore .
So congratulation everybody .
And I think I will still be there next year .
It is really interesting and diversity at the same time .
There is just one thing I want to tell you ; Janine and Richey have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we all would like to go to the show .
That is in the central Exhibition Hall , near the hotel , and it is only about fashion : latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students ( what is really good ) .
It is a great opportunity because this show is only each two years and normaly it is difficult to go in .
In my opinion , I would suggest to go to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time .
Or , going to the show on wensday morning and on the afternoon , we can choose between free time or National Art Gallery .
I look farward to hearing from you .
I went out of the room , ran as much as I could and started thinking what this man was doing here and who he was .
When I arrived in the street it was dark , windy , but I could see a shadow at the corner of the opposite street .
By the time I arrived here , he has disappeared .
My sister was standing , crying and showing the front door .
The police arrived twenty minutes later , took my mother and checked to see what could be interesting to find the murder : lucky , the knife which he used to kill her was still here and in fact they could arrested him .
They found hime two months after and six months after he was in jail .
To forget everything , I moved to Irkind with my sister in a small house in the countryside .
Everything was going on , when one day , I came in the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book , with blood all around her .
I write a letter to complain about your advertisement about the musical show " over the rainbow " , wich is misleading in a number of way .
However it started at 20.15 and we were all very disappointed .
Furthermore , it 's written in your advert that Danny Brook is in the play and that was one of the main reason to why we went .
Imagine how disappointed we got when we found out that he had been replaced .
Besides , when we wanted to buy our tickets we were hoping that the discounting was available .
Unfortunately , it was n't and we could n't afford bying everyone a ticket .
Finally , after the show we had planed to eat diner at the theatre restaurant and we were very disappointed when it turned out to closed .
Therefor , as you may understand I 'm asking for a refund .
Your sincerely ,
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and the rumours describing me stealing soon reached the director 's office .
I was send a letter in which it was written that the director wanted to meet me and my parents .
Sweating and affraid I waited out side the director 's office the following day .
I was unable to image what would happen to me if my parents knew what I had stolen .
' You may enter ' said the director .
Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen .
I was suprised that my father did n't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me .
During the trip home non of us spoke .
The same evening my father pronounced a few words : ' May this be the end of your thief career we are only ready to forgive if you promiss never to start again '
I am writing to answer to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in our competetion , which is two weeks , I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win .
In the second place I add that I would prefer an accomodation in a tent , even though it is not very comfortable , because I want to put myself to the test by living in a condition I am not used to .
Besides this , in connexion with the activities we will have the chance to do , I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both , especially at tennis .
In addition to this I would like to ask you which kind of clothes and how much money it is necessary to have , since I am undecided about it not knowing the cost of life in California .
Yours Sincerely ,
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities of our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students the idea of what we usually do not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time .
Most of the students agree in saying that two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed : it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together without the help of the teacher to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher .
A little percentage , on the contrary , said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is explaining us something important , to give the idea of the real life in our classroom . which is the most .
The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , wich really disapointed me .
First of all , there were no diccounts avaible as it said on the anouncement so I had to pay the original price wich was n't cheap at all .
Then , I was forced to wait fourty five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 in stead of 19:30 and when it finally started , I was really disapointed to see that the actors were n't Danny and Tina as it said on the anouncement .
So , as you can see , it was n't my perfect evening out at all that 's why I demand you to send me my money back .
Your really unsatisfied costomer
How has modern technology afected my daily life ?
Since the begining of human life , people have invented ways to make their life easier .
That is not difference from now .
We live sorrounded by inventions wich help as through the day .
From the vehicle we use to move faster to the light bulb we use at night , we constantly depends on these inventions to be able to make the things we have to do .
That 's why modern technology is so important in our daily life , because it helps to make our life easiest and to do what we have to do faster so then we can use better our time .
I am writing in response to your letter which I received two days go and in order to answer all questions I was asked to .
Second of all , I would prefer to live in a tent .
The reason of my decision is that other activities are availiable to take also in my county , except climbing , but I have fear of heights so this one is not destinated for people like me .
Is this a kind of " all inclusive " holidays ?
I think I told you about my plans of entering a group that helps at concerts , did n't I ?
There was about 100 000 people .
Acctually , they put me very close to the stage , in the middle of the real hell .
I did n't manage to meet Michael as I had expected , but apart from that , I really enjoyed time I spent there .
You should also try .
There are several reasones why I was n't satisfied with it .
Firstly , it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor Danny Brook would play in the show .
Despite it , a different actor stared in the performance , which was really disappointing .
That evening was n't my perfect one out , although it was promised to be so in the advertisement .
This is the main reasone , why I want to ask for a refund .
During the centuries man 's clothes has been changing and even developing in some way .
Nowadays people wear more common clothes .
I think we can make a conclusion : during the centuries man 's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common .
People 's clothes have been changing from metalwear to shorts and miniskirts .
That 's why I suppose , that man 's clothes will be becoming more and more light .
People wo n't be embarassed to show the beauty of their bodies .
Perhaps , metalwear will become a craze again .
I am very happy to have won the first prize of the competition , and I am going to clear up some details you asked me in your letter .
Firstly , because of my school exam , I would like to travel only july .
Moroever , I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine .
At Camp California , I hope I will be in tents because I like very much this kind of style life : I love the contact with the nature .
On the other handDuring my stay in Camp California , I want to go swimming because I practice this activitie regularly and I often do competitions : this is one of my hobbies .
In addition to this , I wish I am going to sail : I have never try it , but it seems to be great !
Finally , I have two questions more : I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming ?
As you asked me in your last letter , I am going to tell you more about the last month 's pop concert .
Firstly , I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene .
As soon as all the conections was made , we tested the nivel of the sound : I found it too loud , so I advised them to regular it , and they listed to me !
Then , there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights : it was just enought time .
Thus , it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music , even if I do n't play any music instrument .
Moreover , I learnt a lot about music , especially concerning the way of using an instrument .
Consequently , I hope I will play an instrument in the future , especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument .
On behalf of my class , I am writing to request few changes in our London programme which has already been planned .
My friends have seen an advertisement which is the London fashion and leissure show .
it will be held on 14th March .
We have decided it would be more interesting to see the latest fashions , make up , hairstyles instead of going to do shopping .
We would suggest gong to this fabolous show .
it is also free of charge for students .
We would all thank you for the organised programme .
I apologise any inconvenience that this cause you . We would be pleased if you could make a new arrangement in your programme
Yours Sincererly ,
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NEW YOUR HOUSE ?
We like them show our life style and of course feel ourself comfortable .
I can imagine in the future how it would be ?
It would be much technological or far less complex . it could be as simple as we think .
but the imagine of the life style depends on person .
Somehow I could say that the main appliance would remain the same working structure .
it only just might be changed the design of things such as a triangular talking oven .
Despite being used in many ways , it could entartian us as well .
On balance I would accept whatever could make my life easier . to live .
I would n't mind having things talking to around me . it would be enjoyable to have virtual friends in my house .
Although I imagine my house in my future , I am sure I would be suprised when I had them .
I was enthusiastic about the special event .
The advertisement shew two actors but I was surprised to see as the main caracter a different person .
As well as this , to my horror , the performance did n't start at 19.30 but forthy five minutes later .
In addition to this , the theatre restaurant was closed for lack of servants .
So , I 'm sure you will understand why I 'm feeling so annoyed by the whole incident . I hope you will give me back the prize of my ticket !
Introduction : It seems to me that modern technology has deeply changed our daily life .
An usefull help : The personal computer can fastly help you in lots of situations .
Moreover , a variety of micro computers are now everywhere such as in your car , on your radio and so on .
Have a good feeling with it ! :
On one side , the modern technology is extremely important , on the other hand you should n't abuse of it .
Conclusion : I do think , however , the modern technology is essential for human being nowadays .
Although the world of computers will develop day by day , I lively hope we ( human being ) could mantain our personality of seeing things .
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE THE WINNER OF YOUR COMPETITION ! I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN SUCH A CAMP BEFORE AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWART TO SPENDING TWO WEEKS THERE .
HERE ARE THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED FOR :
IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN JULY BECAUSE OF MY UNREGULAR WORK .
IN JULY WE HAVE GOT LOW SEASON AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO GO THEN ON HOLLYDAY .
FURTHER I WOULD PREFER TENTS .
I HAVE BEEN IN A SPORT CAMP LAST YEAR AND IT WAS FUNNY TO SLEEP IN TENTS .
FROM THE ACTIVITIES I CHOOSE TENNIS AND SURFING . I PLAY TENNIS IN A CUP FOR FIVE YEARS BUT SURFING I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE .
WE NEED SOME SPECIAL SPORT CLOTHES FOR THIS TWO ACTIVITIES ? AND IS IT ALSO ALLOWED TO BRING MY DOG WITH ?
HE 'S A SMAL ONE !
I'M LOOKING FORWART TO HEARING FROM YOU
YOU KNOW THAT I ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP AT A CONCERT . TO BE IN A STAFF TEAM WOULD BE WONDERFUL , I THOUGTH . AND I WAS RIGHT !
AS YOU KNOW I WROTE TO THAT ORGANISATION WHO IS ALWAYS RESPONSBLE FOR BIG EVENTS .
ALL FROM THE STAFF TEAM AND THE ORGANISATION SPOK ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE .
AFTER THE MEETING WE RECIEVED ALL THE SAME CLOTHES .
WE WERE A GROUPE ! ONE TEAM ! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER .
IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE OTHER HOBBIES AND WORK .
THE CONCERT WAS VERRY LOUD AND LONG BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK HARD .
GREATING AND HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON
However , it had been a very dissappointing evening for me .
Firstly , it was mentioned that there were going to be two starrings but , in fact , only an actor were performing on the show .
Secondly , there was a delay on the show which supposed to started at 19.30 but , it was actually started at 20:15 .
This really upset me as no notice were given before the show .
Thirdly , the advertisment said that the discounts were avaliable but , the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or avaliable .
In addition , the advertisment mentioned that restaurant will be opened after the show but it was closed because , short of cooker .
Finally , I would like to ask for money back for the ticket due to the disapointing evening out and unreliable advertisement you have created .
Nowaday , modern technology is becomming very essential to our daily life .
As it is another important factor which affects our life , apart from money , health , food and house .
The reasons it is important to us are , first of all , if you think bout life without computers , communication machines and transportation machines .
We would n't be able to sort out informations and datas this quickly .
Secondly , no one could communicate on the phone through countries or even through houses as immediate as nowadays .
Lastly , it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travel by plane .
Without all this you life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago .
Put it in another words , modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every ways .
On the other hand , the affects that it has on our daily life is not always good as sometime , the technology went wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disaster accidents , for example : plane crashes , trains crashed and explosion of nuclears bomb .
If this continue to happen our life would be very misarable as accident happens all the time .
I am writing on behalf my English class .
We have just known the programme you prepared for our three - day trip to London .
Thank you very much for many interesting positions in this schedule , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which , we are shure , will be very exciting .
I would like to inform you , that we have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Laisure Show " and we have found it very interesting .
There will a lot of show for instance latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be great opportunity , because the entrance is free for students .
The even is planned on 14th of March between 10.00 am and 19.00 p.m. If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme .
We will be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday 's afternoon .
As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be nice prize for our work during this year .
I would b grateful if you consider our suggestions .
Your sincerelly
Suddenly I heard a noice from my garden and I wanted to know what it was , but it was impossible to do it .
The outside lights were broken down and I could n't see anything .
I was affraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get to my house .
After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen 's window .
I was very frethend , but I knew , that I should do something .
I had no time to call someone and I had to go to my kitchen to check what it was .
I was shure there were someone on the other side of the wall .
It was terrible , I thought that it was the last day of my life .
I had no time to think , I kept one of the pots and hit him in his head .
One moment later I called police .
He was a thief , who were looked for for many years .
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical ' over the rainbow ' , after I read the advertisement for the show .
The things that really dissapointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were suposed to be the actors but they were n't , different actors played and to be honest they made the hole show very bad .
Also the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but finally it started at 20.15 and that is such a waste of others people time .
Another thing was that you said discounts are available which is very important for students , but no their were n't any .
Also after the show your restaurant was closed because their was n't enough staff .
To be honest that was not a great expierence and I hope you will see my point .
I think you will understand that and looking forward to hearing from you .
Since everyone can afford modern technology the life of everyone in the more developed countries has changed completly .
We ca n't imagine to live without it anymore because we are so dependent of it .
It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock , than in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the hole house is warm due to central heating .
If we than want to go to work we do n't have to get our horse , no , we get the car keys and go where ever we want to .
Without that we ca n't do anything today .
So in the last century our daily life changed dramandesly and we became lazy and our life unpersonal , fast and unromantic .
Noone can think about a life without commuters or electricity .
But we ca n't say the new technology has done just bad things in our life because otherwise we could n't have made such progress in all the sciences and other subjects
I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show which happened to be inaccurate at the leaflet given .
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another , unkown actor who starred instead of him .
Another point which caused some inconveniences was the timetable of the show .
It began 45 minutes later than it should have been .
Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket , it occuried to be impossible to have one .
Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open it was not the case because of a lack of available staff .
All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket .
Of course , it was my fault . I should have known better but I had to tell it to someone .
It was far too heavy to keep it for myself .
She denied having revealed my secret but she was averting my eyes .
From this moment , I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know it sooner or later .
I tried to take it on my stride but I could n't .
My fear turned out to be right .
She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice before it .
I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show , but , to my surprise , it was n't him who played that night but another horrible young actor .
I went with my daughter , a university student , and she was supposed to have a discount on the ticket .
We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else , so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets .
Furthermore , it was announced to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone would explain to the audience .
After the play , we went to the theatre 's restaurant and we found out that it was closed since 1999 's spring !
How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant ?
In conclusion , I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because , as you have seen , I did n't spend the " perfect evening " you announce .
Of course , Ann promised not to tell anyone , but by the lunch - break all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams .
She would give them the exam 's questions and they would make all her homeworks during 3 weeks .
It was an unfair deal , but if they wanted the questions they had to accept , and if they accepted , they could n't tell anything to the teachers , because , in fact , they were as guilty as Lise .
I 'm writing this letter to congratulate you for the excellent international arts festival we could enjoy last November .
I found it was a very good idea .
However , there are a few things that I personally think can be improved in the following editions .
First of all , because of the advertisement I expected starts and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries .
Artists from different cultures may make the festival even more interesting .
It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because the short number of seats available .
I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year .
Moreover , in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event , and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week festival .
Finally , the prize was reasonably and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend .
I hope you 'll attend my suggestions .
Once upon a time , in a small Catalan village , there was a little boy who loved cheating and making jokes .
His father was a shelter , He had one hundred sheeps and one dog , and he used to take the animals to the mountain to feed them .
His little son , called Joan , decided quickly : " I will help you . I will take care of the sheeps for you , father " .
the next day he went to the mountain with the animals .
And then he started shouting : " the fox !
Help me ! the fox ! "
Some people went to help him , and then realised that it was not true .
He did it more times , and at last nobody cared of the shoutings .
Then he learned to say always the truth .
Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan .
I am writing to reply about your questions .
I am wondering that I will be only able to travel in July , because I have to finish my first year at the university .
In addition to this , I have already resistered another course which starts from 2nd of August .
Secondly , I would prefer living in tents , I always admire outdoors life .
Finally , I would like to surging and golf .
In case of surfing , I have never had an experience , I am absolutely beginner .
When I was 14 , I won the competition .
Let me know if I have to take which kind of clothes and how much money I need .
Your sincerely
My main job was to tide up her dressing room .
You are working with your idea woman , I ca n't still belive that I spoke with her .
Anyway , the most important thing was that I had good experience .
It 's pity , is n't it ?
Now , I know how difficult to sing in front of the audience and behind the start there are a lot of the people who help the performance .
At first I could n't belive that I was a winer
I would like to travel at the Camp in July , if is possible .
This is just one months which I 've fee .
My school starsts in September and it finishes in June .
July is months when I 'm having a rest and I 'm doing nothing .
In August I 'm working in the shop which is my sister .
If I could go in July would be greate .
I can sleep in tent , it would remain me a good time which I 'd spent with my friends a few years ago . I 'm not scared of darkness , rain , cold or hot whether .
I 'm sure would be good fun ; sleep next to each other telling scared story .
Is good for make friends , you can know them better doing everything together .
This is sport which I , , love " .
I play basketball since I was 12 .
Some of my friends say that I 'm very good player , but I do n't think so .
In swimming I 'm not as good as in basketball , but I 'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it .
I would like to ask you , what sort of clothes shall I take with me ? I do n't want take too much ; jeans , jumper , swimming costium , T - shirt , sports shoes I think should b O.K.
Know , I can just wait for July
I 'm so exited .
It was Tina Turner concert !
To this moment when I 'm thinking of it I want shout .
At first I was helping to seill the tickets - was n't difficult .
Anyway , four hours , before concert had started , I was helping with lights .
We had to check evey plug , switch , lights .
I could n't belive how big the lamp can be .
When concert had started and Tina cam out I forget about lights , just I was looking at her .
fortunetly nothing had happend .
Every - thing was O.K
After concert we were invited in backstage . then I could see her very , very clear .
Just people who was helping and organizating this concert could meet her .
Some of them were speaking with her , I was n't this lucky person , but still I 'm happy , that I could be thear .
I am writing to answer the informations that you need from me .
First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize .
Answering your questions , I would like to travel only en July because this is the month of my vacations .
According to your letter I have two options of accommodation , or in tents or log cabins .
I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me .
I never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere , in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new .
Log cabins may be more confortable , on the other hand I think that I will be able to " survive " in tents .
Looking to your letter , I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them .
The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast itselves , I want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing , that asks only for my ability to paint .
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that , however I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp .
Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it .
I have some doubts about my prize and travel .
Is there a possibility that you send me a list of material and clothes that I have to take ?
Is all the travel already paid including food and meals , or I have to bring some money ?
Do I have to bring something especial for the tents and camping ?
Please answer my letter as soon as is possible .
Your faithfully ,
Is everything good in USA ?
There was a concert of a famous band here in my city .
I vish you were here with me .
We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan 's bus .
Yes , there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back .
When we entered inside of it , we saw a lot of fans using T - shirts , caps and shouting , " Almendegos , Almendegos ... " ( that is the name of the band ) .
AT 20:00 , we stopped in a coffee house to eat .
The shouted : " 20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave . "
They were very interesting and we liked him so much .
After a few minutes ( I fought were few ) I realized that the coffee house was empty .
I looked to my watch : 20:45 .
The bus had left about fifteen minutes .
The man offered a ride .
We accept .
You can not imagine how dissapointed I were with my ownself .
When we arrived the concert had already began .
He was helping to put the materials of the concerts ( microphone ... ) on the stage .
We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was entering into the stage near us .
By my side the vocal of the Almendegos was and he touched my arm .
After all of this we saw the show in the best place , near of the stage and after , the thing that I most liked , we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures .
I wish that you liked my experience .
How are you ? I have been the musical show " over the rainbow " in your theatre last week .
I have got a few things to complain about your theart .
The first thing is in your note says that you should have got Danny Brook in the show .
But in the show , there was a another actor .
I was so disappointing , because I came far away to see Danny Broke .
In the note also says that the show start at 19:30 , and so I went in at 19:25 .
The show was started at 20:15 , which means it has wasted one hour of my time .
Note says that tickets has discounts available , but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is not any discount for thicket .
When the show is finished .
I deciced to go and visit your theatre restaurant ,
But I went there and it is closed for some reasons .
I was really hungry and I went to other restaurant as soon as I can .
The note says that your perfect evening out , I thought I could get my money back , with your poor service and all my reasons , But it was not ask for money back .
I was really disappointed about your threat and service , I hope I can get my money back and you can improve it . Than you for reading .
In the pass , people have to go and get wood , make a fire and cook , but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work .
Science and technology can give us a better live style or better food .
For example , before people have to walk from a place to the other , but now we can use sciene and technology to produce a lot of petrel transport and we can transport with them faster .
We also can produce more and better food or using science and technology . e.g. use science to put all the good part of two plants into one plant .
We can also use techlogy to produce more food and help them grow faster .
Science and technology can also used for some material e.g. steel or iron , which use for our building , it can make it stronger and not easy to destroy .
Science and technology can give us a lot of good thing for our daily life , make us easy to do thing or work .
I would like to tell you some suggestions .
The stars and artist are from only six countries , and some concerts take place in small halls .
I think you should put it in the advertisement .
I find the reasonably - priced ticket excellent , because there is a lot of people who went to see only one or two events , and by paying the all events ticket they might see other events and learn about something they did n't expected to find interesting .
Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school .
In general , the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools .
But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams .
the rules at home are very different . I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove .
I think that my parents let me do what I want , because they trust me . they know that if I go out with the car , I will not drink .
It is not allways easy , but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them .
I have come to watch the musical show called ' Over The Rainbow ' in the Circle Theatre .
I will explain these now and want to ask to get some of the money I have given you back .
It was written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring in the show .
The musical show was going to start at 19.30 , but it started t 20:15 .
We have waited for 45 minutes getting bored for it to start !
When I went to buy tickets , they did n't accept the discounts .
But I had read that the discounts were available .
Like it was written again , we went to visit the theatre restaurant after the show , but it was closed .
They said that the time was late and they wanted to go home .
There was nothing for us to do , the show started 45 minutes later .
Now , I think that you have seen it was not a perfect evening at all , a lot of things written were not done So I am asking to get some of my money back .
MY daily life . I get up early in the morning , go to school , then come home and do what I would like to do .
I go shopping , watch TV , walk around the city , use my computer and get lost in Internet . etc .
I do n't see it in a normal day , but when I sit and think , its everywhere !
It 's not a good example for modern technology , but it 's a piece of technology at last !
Now it 's colourful and there are many channels on TV .
I ca n't think that I watch the same channels every day .
A wonderful example for modern technology : Computer !
It knows more than most of the people .
And Internet . You can look for everything you want .
You can talk to every people living all around the world .
You do n't understand the time passing when you are in that world .
You can have information about all the things , go everywhere .
You can reach them whenever you want !
Firstly , I can travel only in July because I have no time except July as I am a postgraduate student . I would very much like to stay in a log cabin .
I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for few days but not over 3 days .
Regarding with two activities I will choose swimming and photography .
On the other hand , I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college .
I like ice cram , sweets and beverage very much especially in the summer .
When you do shopping , you can see various products even very extraordinary thing .
You can also see more graceful and fine thing .
You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you .
On the other hand , it usually take much time to get what you exactly want .
Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing .
If shopping mall is not collected , it is physically hard to get what you want .
It 's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping .
It even varys with people whom you shop with .
I 'm writing to you to make complaints for the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre .
Firstly , I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement .
Then , I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than it was expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another one ( very bad ) as well .
Of course I must tell you that the strongest reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook 's presence .
Finally , after the show , I went to the theatre restaurant just to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me .
As if that was not enough he thought I had been kidding , inviting him to a closed restaurant where I did n't appear .
Those were the reasons for my asking a refund of the £ 20 I paid .
Every day we find out new devices that promise us to satisfy our needs .
I usually do n't buy a lot of them but I must recognise that some of them are useful .
I ca n't remember waking up with the alarm - clock , making a hand - made orange juice or heating water for the coffee .
Therefore , I have more spare time to enjoy the one I consider as the most important influence technology had in my life : the computer and Internet .
The improvement of electronics and global communications has made it possible to know places , look for information or even keep close contact with friends all over the world .
Now , I will never say again that I do n't know where can I find some information about this or that and when on holidays or every time I make a new friend , I just ask for the email and that 's enough to know we will know about each other soon .
I am writing in the name of the whole class .
First of al , I want to thank you for the interesting programme , which you already have organised .
It is very good , especially the Sightseeing tour by bus .
However , we have seen an advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
There we can see everything about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
The entrance for student is free .
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education .
Instead of going to the Science Museum on Tuesday morning we thought we could postpone it to Wednesday afternoon .
I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate to contact me .
It 's quite difficult to say , but of course there will be a change .
For example if you look back into the forties and compare the home with nowadays you can see that it has become more modern , especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom .
in the future it could be that you do n't have to prepare your breakfast by your own , perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone .
In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table , tidying up the house , doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners .
The livingroom wo n't get any big changes although the televisions , stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult .
In general we can say the huge change we already had , but who knows exactly what the future will bring to us ?
Let 's have a surprise ?
Thank you for your letter which I have just received this morning .
I am really appreciated to hear that I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am writing this letter to inform you more information about myself .
I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air .
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp which are swimming and photography .
Photography is quite interesting for me to take a photograph in the place where I have never been to .
Swimming is quite nice activity to relax and work out .
Anyway , I would like to know that how many people are joining at this Camp .
I 'm really sorry , it 's taken me so long to reply .
I and my friend - Emma , we helped to paint the scence of the background on the stage .
As you known , I like drawing and painting when I have a free time so that why I chose to paint the scence of the background .
And I particularly liked the experience that I helped to screen and paint a picture of " Bon Jovi " on every T - shirts which are given to the audiences .
However , I told my teacher that I am willing to give a hand next time .
Are you willing to give a hand next time ?
If you are , I 'll tell you in advance .
First of all , it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in a real show , it was n't .
Because I 'm big fan of them , if was pretty much boring without them and not to mention that it was disappointing .
Moreover the testament was till under the construction so that we could n't use it when we were extlemely hungry .
Finally , I wonder why you did n't ask for the money back if you have guaranteed the perfect evening .
Technology has been developed extremely fast these days and as it is still going on , it ca n't help affecting our lives .
One of the biggist thing has changed is a change in a method of communications .
People have invented such things like TV , radio , telephones and so on which made us enable to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily .
Nearly almost of the disease have been found the way to cure except only a few like AIDS .
I have mentioned few changes above but there 's still a biggist one left which is about computer areas .
It helped us to be able to work much more quicker and accurately than before with the help of Internet .
Basically modern technology has changed our life more comfortably but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship , togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for whole day .
But we still have to admit that we ca n't live without them even they give us some disadvantages .
As I am doing my A - levels exams at the moment and they continue until the 30th of June and my further studies start in August , I can only travel in July .
It will give me an adventure feeling and I have always prefered tents to log cabins .
I have never tried out climbing , but I have always wished to do it one day .
Would you be kind enough to tell me which kind of clothes I should bring with me ?
Would you recommend me to bring some equipment , like a rope , sticks , with me ?
You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop - concert .
This included to clean up the rooms which were used by the singers and put some equipment on the stage .
I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms , in which singers dress and make - up , are actually small .
Can you imagine , I could stay at this concert without paying anything !
And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage .
O.K. , I actually asked him only : ' How are you ? ' and he gave me his signature .
He was fantastic , you know that he is my favourite singer .
Probably it was n't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do , but you see many stars out of stage .
And you might manage to speak to some pop - stars .
Beside this , I earned some money , not a lot but enough for me .
I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised for the Circle Theatre and the recent musical :
On Saturday , June 5th , 2000 my wife and I wanted to spend a nice and enjoyable evening and decided to go and see the musical .
When we arrived at the theatre we had to realise that there were no discountable tickets available as mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones .
After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the film would have began at 20:15 o'clock instead of 19:30 o'clock as indicated .
So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink .
To make the matters worse Danny Brook who was announced as one of the starring person in the musical was not acting this evening .
You can imagine how disappointed we were especially the acting of Danny Brook was the main reason for us to see the musical .
On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities .
As you can imagine we were very disappointed and it was n't a perfect evening out I would like to have 50% of the prize of the tickets back .
I am looking forward to your promt reply .
Today the fashion industrie has a great importance in the commercial market .
In the next 100 years there will be no change in that but the fashion is going to develop in a special imaginative way .
Firstly , the material of which clothes are made has a wide range .
There are the natural material on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produce more and more syntetical clothes , which relay on the production cost .
In 100 years most of the clothes are made from syntetical material .
Beyond colours will play an important role in the next century for the fashion .
Especially contrast will be attractiv .
Furthermore the style of the clothes are going to be more crazy and individuell but there will be still enumerous clothes for the solid people .
One balance fashion in 100 years time will be confortable and colourful .
The fashion industry will deliver a wide range of vararity in style , material and colour .
There will be clothes for everyones tast .
First of all , I 'd like you to know that the whole organization was nearly excellent .
I could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries , but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries .
The jazz , classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were too small .
Plays and films I watched were also excellent , but more could be on the stage next year .
I joined the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures .
The dance shows made sight for our sour eyes , they were really fascinating .
I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas , their life styles by talking to them .
Beyond all these , the application of joining all activities by one nice - priced ticket was excellent ; because it saved you from buying one ticket for each activity .
Next year , I think you should increase the number of shows , concerts and others , also the time spent at the festival ( for example : at least 5 days ) , then everything would be perfect .
Thank you for making a great festival which made all the art activities come together .
Yours Sincerely ,
It 's the same here . I 've got too many exams nowadays , but that 's all .
By the way , it would be better If you wrote quite often to me .
Our school is really very diciplined , especially about our clothes and behaviours .
I understand the second part , but I ca n't get the reason of wearing in white an dark blue only .
It can be said that I 'm much more free at home . I 'm allowed to do whatever I want at my room .
I have just received your letter and I am writing in response of your questions .
I can travel only in july because is the only month of this year that I will be available because I finish school in june so I will be very busy and in August I start to study at the University , so july is the best month for me to travel .
Accommodation for me is not problem .
I am very easy going and I will be satisfied wherever .
But if I have to choose , I prefer sleep in tents , because when I travel I usually sleep in that kind of accommodation so , for me they seem very comfortable .
- Tennis because is my favourite sport and I enjoy playing it .
I play tennis since I was a child and I have won some competitions in my town so I think I play very well .
I am a terrible climber but with a little bit of help I think I can enjoy the activity and have a good time unforgettable .
I wonder to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I do n't know how the weather is in U.S.A. Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring to the trip .
I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible .
Thank you for your letter it was great to hear from you .
Sorry but I haven't written you because I 've been very busy .
Last month I helped at a pop concert , it was marvellous .
I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered to me work with an English singer so I said " yes , of course " .
But you ca n't imagine who was the singer , it was Sting , can you imagine ?
My job was very easy I had to help Sting in everything , for example if he wanted water , I had to give to him water , it was marvellous .
He was very kind to me , we talked many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have a dinner , yes I know what you 're thinking , " Dinner and Sting " yes my friend it was the best thing in my life .
I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I spoken very well English .
The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it and I met my favourite singer .
I hope my friend call me again to work because I had a wonderful time and it was a great and unforgettable experience .
P.D. I send you an autograph that Sting wrote for you .
I have read your advertisement for the show and I went to the theatre to see it but I had a very disappointing evening .
In your advertisement , said that one of the actor was Danny Brook but it was a different actor .
This was very disappointing and I believe that all the people there , were angry .
The musical show must have been started at half past seven but it started at quarter past eight .
About the tickets , I the advertisement said that discounts would be available but it would not .
When I read the advertisement , it said that the restaurand would be opened .
Lastly , I want to tell you that I had not a perfect evening and I would be grateful if you could send me my money back .
I am looking forward to your answer .
She lived next to my house and we went to the same school .
One day I heard my mother to tell my father that she want to divorce because she ca n't live with him any more .
When I heard it , I went to my room and I was crying .
I called Pat to come to my house because I was not very good and to tell her what had happened .
Few minutes later Pat came to my house and I told her that my parents are going to divorce .
Pat did not believe me and she started to ask why .
She helped me to forget it for a few minutes , she made me to laugh and the she left .
But before she left I begged her not to tell anybody .
The other morning I went to school and all the students came next to me and told me not to be mad because of my parents .
Then I realised that Pat told my secret and I felt very angry , that 's why I said at the beginning that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets .
In the name of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised , especially the idea of visiting a galery .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00 .
It is a famous exhibition , where are showed latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life .
Could it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping time and to replace them by the London Show ?
We may go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of the afternoon free time .
I'am looking forward to hearing from you .
I had always wanted to swim in the middle of sharks .
When I was a child , I used to go with him travelling from harbours to harbours .
I grew up through the water world and I could n't live whitout it .
Once I was fishing , when sharks came all around me .
Since this famous experience , I dreamt every night about that .
One Saturday I got on my motorboat and rode far away from the reef .
My father was sitting next to me thinking that I was crazy .
In order to the prize , I would like to travel , if it is possible , on July because I am a student and my winter brake is taking place during this month , July .
I would prepare to stay in a cabin because I have not got really good experiences in camping in tents , last time a bear came inside while I was in .
I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp , by the way my team and I won the last scholl championship , I play guard on my team , I also like tennis but I am not very good , I was wondering if you could give me some lesson while I am there .
I do not have words to express how happy I am , I would like to thanks you and Camp California for this oportunity .
Hoping to hear soon from you .
Since the man become man he has had the need of hunting for sourvive , in ancient times he used spears , bows and arrows , and the wemon 's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff .
Nowadays in the year 2000 we still practice this ancient art but in a diferent way , we do n't use weapons for hunting animal in the jungle , we use the remote to hunt TV shows , and we do not collect vegetables any more we go shopping .
This activity of shopping has become one of our most important , after all , we go shopping for any reason , we have develop such an instinc for shopping that we can proudly say , that we are some sort of kings in the urban jungle .
If an activity has stay with us , the mankind , for so long , it must give us some pleasure and maybe that 's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price mark on it , that is the greatest extasis .
But where is the bad poet of it , well shopping can became horrible in christmast for example when houndred of people goes to the shopping center and it also can take many problems when you become an impulsive buyer .
Any ways shopping is with us and it will stay with us for a long time .
I am writing because I received your letter saying that I won first prize , a two week holiday at Camp California in U.S.A , and that you need further information from me .
Firstly , I would like to travel on July , because is the only month I have holidays in .
Secondly , I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they 're more comfortable than the tents , also because I do n't like to sleep in tents very much , I think they 're very cold during the night
About the activities , I have chosen basketball because I enjoy playing it , and also because I know very well how to play .
I used to be the captain of the selection of bascketball in my school , because I was the best to play , and I think I can still remember how to play .
The second activity I chose was tennis , I am not so good , but I know how to play , I have played several times with my friends .
To finish I would like to ask you for toiletries like for example shampoo , soap , etc .
so that I do n't have to carry them in my luggage , I think they would just occupy extra space .
Another thing I would like to ask you for , is money .
Nevertheless I need money for restaurants and souvenirs that I can buy in the Camp .
I think that 's all , and I look foreword to hearing from you soon .
Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors .
One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like , and you decide to buy it , but when you see the price , you find out that it 's too expencive , and you can not afford to buy it .
The only thing you mostly say is , " If I had more money , I would buy it " , or " I wish I had more money . "
Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things , and can not help you , so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own .
I think this is a common problem in shops , and that 's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything , and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers .
This cituation is very annoying for most of the people , and that 's what makes shopping unejoyable .
I 'm very much surprised to receive your letter announcing the first prize in your competition and I 'm looking forward to spend the two weeks at Camp California .
Just because I 'm studying at the moment and I wo n't have my holidays till July .
I find it will be much more comfortable than a tent .
The leisure activities sound fantastic especially climbing and photography .
I 'm very keen on climbing . I 've joined a climbing group in my town 2 years and reached the top of several middle - high mountains .
I have no previous experience on it but I wish I 'd learn a lot .
However , there are some questions that I want to ask you about .
Do I need passport to travel ?
Are there any food service at the camp ?
This is a report to plan and suggest ideas for the daily life video at school .
The activities suggested are write below .
The opening time recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in could be a good begining .
Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and speaking either theory lessons or practice would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons .
Why do n't include some sports , for example , voleyball ?
The team has been training very hard during last weeks .
And they 'll certainly feel very proud of being at the video .
The musical lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among the students of all courses .
I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities the combination will give us complete success .
I am writing this letter to inform you that the advertisement for the musical show was with wrong information .
Firstly , the actors were different from the ones written in the advertisement which was very disappointing for me .
Furthermore , according to the advertisement I was supposed to begin at 14.30 and 19.30 but it started at 20.15 .
Moreover , when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts available , however , there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price written in the advertisement .
When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant I could not get in because it was closed as the chef of the restaurant was not there .
Firstly , we can cook our meals an electrical stove or in a microwave and it takes just a few minutes to get ready .
We do not need to lit fire in order to cook as in the old days .
Secondly , the doctors have found the cure for many diseases and many operations have been done in less time and in a painless way , by using especial machines doctors have be able to save more lives than in the past .
For those who need to travel in order to make business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive in their destination safely or have their problems solved through telephone .
In the future , it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day .
I was so impressed the exhibitions of the festival that you had organized .
Furthermore , it 's worthful experience for people to know the other countries ' arts .
But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival .
Firstly , it is better to invite more artists not only from six countries .
For example , the artists or stars from we have rare chance to feel the atmosphere .
Secondly , some concert halls were too small to enter all of the audience .
Moreover , plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people had gathered one time .
I would prefer to be held more performances next year in the bigger halls .
Finally , regards to tickets , it is very wonderful idea because it is more combinient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people .
You may consider my suggestion to have the art festival for next year .
Long long time ago , there were the old man and old woman lived in a foot of mountain .
One day , when the old man went into the bambo bush , he found one bambo gritted white .
He had never seen such bambo before but decided to cut it down .
Then there was a lovely baby in it .
She grew very quick and was so beautiful .
A lot of men asked her to marry with them but she always refused .
One full moon night she said to her parents sadly , ' I have to return to the Moon tonight . '
The old man and woman tried to keep her staying their house , but they could n't .
The servants from the Moon picked her up to the Moon .
She gone away .
This story happened a long time ago .
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE NICE SURPRISE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN TO ME , I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT THAT I WON THE FIRST PRIZE .
I'M AFRAID I CAN ONLY GO ON JULY BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME I WILL HAVE HOLIDAYS FROM SCHOOL ,
SO THAT WILL FOR ME THE ONLY POSSIBILITY TO TAKE 2 WEEKS OFF .
THE KIND OF ACCOMODATION I PREFER IS IN A TENT BECAUSE IN A SOMMER CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING ' OUTSIDE ' UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM .
THERE ARE TWO ACTIVITIES I WOULD LIKE TO PRACTICE : BASKETBALL AND PAINTING .
IM QUITE GOOD PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL , WE USED TO HAVE TRAININGS TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES AT MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER SCHOOLS , WHICH WAS GREAT .
PAINTING ALWAYS DID FASCINATED ME , EVEN I'M NOT SO GOOD ON IT , BUT MY FRIENDS THEY SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO , THE TECHNIK I LIKE THE MOST IS WATERCOLORS .
- CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW IS THE WEATHER THEN , SO I CAN TAKE THE PROPER CLOTHES ?
- MY PARENTS AND ME WE ARE NOT SURE HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED FOR THE TWO WEEKS , CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE HELP ? THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE HEARING FROM YOU SOON .
HELLO MY GOOD FRIEND ! ,
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY EXPIERENCE HELPING AT THE POP CONCERT IN OUR TOWN ?
, WELL THAT 'S GREAT , BECAUSE IT WAS A TERRIFIC DAY .
FIRST WE STARTED VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING BUILDING UP THE STAGE AND THE TENT WHERE THE GROUP WAS GOING TO PLAY , YOU KNOW JUST IN CASE THE RAIN WOULD HAVE COME , BUT WE WERE VERY LUCKY AND THE WEATHER WAS SUNNY AND WARM .
THEN CAME THE GUY WHO INSTALLED THE SOUND ( CABLES , BOXES , WIRES , ETC ) AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING SEEING HIM AT WORK , EVERYTHING HAD TO BE ON THE RIGHT PLACE , PERFECTLY INSTALLED AND PROTECTED TO AVOID ACCIDENTS .
AT ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK EVERYTHING WAS READY AND THE BAND CAME IN , THERE WERE ALREADY PLENTY OF ' FANS ' WAITING FOR THE CONCERT TO BEGIN , WHICH STARTED AT 7 O'CLOCK .
I KNOW THE MUSICIANS FROM THE SCHOOL TIME , THAT 'S WHY IT WAS EVEN MORE FUN TO HELP AND TO TAKE PART ON THIS EVENT , SPECIALLY BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC THEY PLAY .
THE PEOPLE WENT CRAZY DURING THE 2 HOURS CONCERT AND AT LEAST I HELPED AS WELL SELLING CD 'S , IF THEY WERE ON SELLING THAT MUCH , THEY ARE GOING TO BE FOR SURE VERY FAMOUS .....
My name is Furilo J.M. and last month I spent a few days in London , I visited you theatre .
The reason I 'm writting this letter for you is that in my staying in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre .
When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star , someone actually did n't appear , I noticed there in the show , someone completely different of him so I felt bad .
Moreover , this complaining is not only about the actor , who ever , the problem is that the show started too late .
I arrived there at 19:00 and the show began only 20:15 .
I bought my tickets , I noticed I did n't have any discounts as it was written on the folder .
After the show I wanted some thing on the theatre 's restaurant , but it was closed .
After all the inconvenients that made me feel really mad . I think I can forgive your theatre , only if you give me a refund of the money I spent there , and some other more for all the problems I had .
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on your own mind .
Every person in the world looks for technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life .
We young people do n't remember when technology was n't part of our daily life , but our parents , or grand parents remember exactly when they were young , and everything was made in a different way , for example our parents did n't have computers at home when they were teenagers .
Nowadays , it 's very common to have a computer at your house , and when you have to do a homework , you can type it on your computer , print it and bring it to the school , also you can search for new subjects on the internet .
Finally , technology is a word that will never get out of our minds , and we do n't know how technology , and in which speed it will develop to the future .
Maybe , technology will never stop growing and our life will never work without computers .
Even if I worked hard on it , I was very surprised of winning just the first prize .
At the moment , I 'm worried of about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently achieved a new job and I started working just three months ago .
For this reason I am afraid I wo n't be allowed to chose the period for my holidays .
Consequently I hope that is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July , when the company I work with suspends its activities .
As far as I am concerned , I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin , but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tend as well .
As you already know , I am trying to become a professional photographer , consequently I would choose photograpy as the first activities and painting as the second .
However I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy activities are only for beginners .
Yours faithfully
Actualy most people work hard to earn their money and consequently , the occasion in which this money is spent to buy something useful , or simply something they like , should be considered a very pleasant situation .
In fact , the shopping you do for the daily needs is seldom enjouble , as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations .
Anyway if you can choose the time and the place , and if you go shopping just because you like it , and not because you need it , shopping can be a very nice activity .
Personally I do n't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops , so I buy all what I can using " on - line " services .
God bless the one who invented the Internet !
I 'm writing you this letter because yesterday I went to the theatre to see the musical show and I had many problems , so I demand my money back .
First of all when I paid my entrance they did n't acept me my discount ticket , they said me that the ticket was false , then I enter to the theatre and I had to wait 45 min , the show was suposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15 , " this is a lack of respect " .
When the show started the starring was wrong because it said that act Danny Brook and Tina Truelove and Danny Brook did'n act , it was another actor that nobody knew , " Really this is very disappointing " .
After the show I planned to go to the restaurant with my wife , but what do you think it happened ? " The restaurant was closed " .
Manager I spect that you considered my bad experience in your theatre , so I 'm asking you for my money back , because , it was a very bad evening .
The class had organized a secret party for our friend , Nick that was leaving the school on 2 more weeks .
All started when Pat , the best friend of Nick , wanted to make the party in his house , most of the class disagree with that because the house of Pat is extremly little , they started to say him that his house was like a box .
Pat got very angree and sad .
Pat affected with this situation told Nick all the situation and the secret of the class .
At the beginning Nick got angree but then he forgive him because they were friend and each of one can trust on the other .
Nick told the situation to the class and ofered his house to do the party , because was very big , with large gardens and a big swimingpool .
The day of the party all had fun especially Pat that at the beggining was sad .
I had recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival .
It was the first time I went and I was very pleased to go .
I , actually , was n't disappointed .
First of all , I congratulate you on making this kind of event .
It was such a good success that some people were n't able to have tickets !
You should increase the number of places you give .
Therefore , you could invite artists from around the world not only from six countries : it would be more pleasant .
Although I am keen on classical music , I found some concerts halled too small .
Also , there were interesting films but not enough .
Perhaps , you could possibly meet some producers , who come from others countries in order to show different cultures .
Besides , to pay one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time .
Finally I suggest to invite important scientists like Hubert Reeves or Aaroun Tazief so as to inform the public about the new technologies or sciences because it also a kind of art !
I look forward to seeing the next festival !
I see you are interested in hearing about school rules in France and also about what I am allowed or not to do at home .
To begin with the wchool rules we have in fact some important ones .
Firstly , when you arrive late at your lesson , you have to apologize you to your teacher .
Also when you have forgotten to do your homeworks .
What 's more , you had better have done them if you would have to go to the blackboard !
Although our library is very large , we must n't make noise in order not to disturb the students , who work .
It may be like that in your library , may not it ?
At home , I have to look after my two little brothers when my parent 's are here .
If I do n't make the cooking , I will have to do the washing up .
I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homeworks .
Fortunately I can play violin when I want even if I haven't done my homework .
I do n't really want to change that , I think it is just like this .
I am writing to inform you the information you asked me .
Owing toe the summer course I take starting in August , July is the only month I have free time .
With regard to place to stay , I would be most grateful if I could stay in a log cabin .
Since I have studied photography for several years , I would like to take some picture of beautiful scenaries in California .
As photography , swimming is my best way of relaxation .
It would be grateful if I could go swimming during the stays .
First of all , if you want to buy nice dresses , the first thing you have to do is looking around all shops and department stores in a city .
If you are lucky enough , you might find them within 30 minutes , but if you do n't , you might have to keep walking for several hours and still could n't find ones ! !
That 's would be so exhausting .
Next thing you have to do is trying them on .
After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill - fitted clothes taking off and putting on .
That 's a hell ! !
To sum up , although there is certainly a good side of shopping , such as pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for long time , you also have some unpleasant moments to get through .
First of all , the show began three quarters of an hour late : it started at quarter past eight instead of half past seven , what of course was very bothering .
I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook , who was supposed to play the main character , but he did n't appeared .
He had been replaced by a really bad actor , whom I do n't even know the name .
I was very disappoint of that change , because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite actor .
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets , what appeared to be wrong to .
I had to pay the full prize for them , which was quite expencive .
It turned to be impossible : the restaurant was closed and we did n't even received an explaination therefor .
First off all , if computers haden't been invented , I would n't spend half of the day in front of it !
I use my computer for many things , such as homeworks , games , digital video or Internet .
The developpement of portable communication systems , such as mobile phones has greatly changed our way of life .
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhen , even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other .
Precision industry has changed my life a lot too . I practicate Scuba Diving during the week - ends and hollydays .
That would n't have been possible a century ago , because all our material , such as dive computers , tanks or regulators did n't existed at that time .
I think that we live easier now ( thanks to modern medicine ) and that our lives will get easier with the time .
I 'm so happy and exciting to receive this letter about I 've won the first prize in your competition .
I 've been dreaming to travel to U.S.A for so many years .
The dream happens to me now .
I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest .
And I 'm sure about that the weather in July will be lovely !
I prefer living in tents to living in log cabins .
I think living in tents is more comfortable for sleeping .
Basket ball is my favourite sporting .
It 's one of the most popular sports in U.S.A as well in my opinion .
But I never try it before .
Also I got two questions to ask you .
The first one is that shall I take a lot of money or just a little ?
And the last one is that do I need pillow or blanket or something else ?
Sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people 's working express .
Also for example .
you really like some shoes or clothes , when you want to buy them , someone tell you " I 'm sorry , this one is sold out " !
And sometimes for example , you just bought something last week , but when you go shopping this week , you see the same items but different prices , maybe from £ 50 down to £ 20 , and then you 'll regret wasting money , although you like it very much .
If you were rich man it does n't mater , but if you were poor man , you will be sad !
How can shopping be enjoyable at thoese situation !
Thank you very much for good programme !
We think , that you also would like to go there , when you 'll know about it better .
There will be showed the latest fashions .
We know , that you wanted to have another and did n't know which one .
Also , you 'll be glad to know , that for students it is free !
So , we think , that it is very good as for you as for us .
So , we can change your programme a little bit to the best one .
On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich , as you have written on your programme .
And on Wednesday morning we go to the national art gallery , but after that we can go to the Science Museum , in the afternoon .
We 're sure , that you like it very much !
My best friend told me , she met one boy .
She was speaking about him every time .
She told me , that he was hansom , kind , well - understanding ( he understood her from a half of the word ) ; the main was he also liked her very much !
I belived everything she has told me .
And said just to be careful .
But in three days she hasn't been at home .
In three days of her disappearing the phone has rung .
I took the phone .
Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend , I must take 5000 $ and bring them up to the street .
I took any papers , put them to one bag and without saying anything went to my friend to take something like gun .
The friend gave me his toy and I gone to the street .
I showed the man , that I had a gun and money .
I surprised that he belived me .
I gave him the bag took the friends hand and we run away .
After that she told me , that the man was the boy , which she met .
I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you liked it .
We are very grateful to you for these three days that we are going to spend in the English capital , especially because you planned very interesting and different kinds of things to do for all us .
However , all we agree that we would like to introduce a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show in the Central Exhibition Hall of London in the trip organisation . I am sure that , if you allow us to go , we are going to enjoy it a lot , to learn new topics about the English culture and have an opportunity to communicate ourselves with all those professional of the fashion .
It is a very good chance to join this exhibition to see all the new fashion tendences , the latest hairstyles and make up as all we came from many different countries and have not the same customs either .
As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of doing shopping in the afternoon .
By this way , we would visit the museum as you had planned and n Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished it .
We do hope you like our suggestion and we can have an agreement to join the fashion exhibition .
Yours sincerelly ,
They are human beings actually and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity and freedom in their lifes to continue like normal people , to feel that they are unknown and anonymus and they do not have to wear sunglasses , hats or caps every time they want to go out home not to be recognised ..
Nevertheless , if the famous are known everywhere in the world it is because of the people , if they appear often on TV or in films it is because of their popularity , a popularity which has given to them by all us .
To sum up I would like to say that for me is very difficult which group has the reason but , by the moment , we should try to respect each other and go in the other 's soul to feel like them in those moments we can not understand them .
Now , I am writing to you to ask some details about these two weeks at Camp California and giving some answers to your questions .
First of all , I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am in holidays .
About the accommodation , I would prefer staying in tents as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child .
Furthermore , you asked me to choise two activities I would like to do .
Firstly , I will be happy to play tennis because I used to play this sport with my village club for five years and earned a few competitions .
Secondly , I am very interesting in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time each other .
We had a lot of fun during our last holidays and we took a lot of pictures .
As the instructions about clothes and money were not enclosed in your letter , I request about it and ask you to include in it .
Thank you very much , I look forward to hearing from you .
A lot of people like doing shopping but most of them might tell you that sometimes is not always enjoyable .
And nowadays people must do shopping either they like it or not .
For people who used to do shopping , going in big stores , I think they like it and they are always looking for fashioned - clothes .
But when these stores are full of people , crowded , like the sales period , I am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring .
In my opinion , I think people have to do shopping even though they do n't appreciate it very much .
If these people have a family with children , they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people .
And now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety .
We are eager to attend National Art Gallery and Science Museum .
But we would like to make our suggestion , if you do n't mind .
It will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday on the 14th of March from 10 a.m. to 19 p.m.
Our students will have a great opportunity of seeing the latest fashion , as this unique show is held only once a year .
And apart from it , this activity is free of charge .
We are thinking here particularly of the fact , that we can go to the show , instead of shopping .
Faithfully yours ,
We tend to think that famous people , such as politicians and film stars are very happy and satisfied with their life .
It is quite obvious , that celebreties ca n't lead a normal life , as they are constantly followed by reporters , what makes their life miserable .
The first point I would like to make is that a private life of a celebrity is open to public .
I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildely discussed in the mass - media .
It is common knowledge , that such an attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family .
Another aspect is that children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention .
They ca n't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools .
And last , but not least is the fact that famous people ca n't express their emotions , show their real feelings to public .
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved , bad - tempered and angry with the world for interfering into their lives .
I would like to sum up by saying that every person , either famous or not , deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed .
The show was called ' Over the rainbow ' I was not pleased with the way that was set out .
First of all , when I went and bought my ticket , there was no discount but in your advertisement it said clearly that discounts are available and as a result my ticket was bought more expensive .
Secondly , the show I went was the evening one , which was supposed to start at 7:30 p.m. but it had a 41 minutes delay and ended up starting at 8.15 p.m.
Furthermore , the original actor was Danny Brook but it changed to a different actor which acted terribly and was very disappointing .
Last of all , it said in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was redecorating and no annocement was made .
I did n't have a perfect evening out and instead I had a awful evening out .
Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like a apolygists .
Thank you from you
Your Sincelery ,
What do you think modles will wear in cat walks ?
Who know ?
Nowaday , people look at fashion - magesins or get opinions from their friends to decide what to wear in different occasions
Will they still do the same 100 years later ?
In my opinion , I think clothes will be a lot differente 100 years later compare to now .
As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves which leads to changes in fashion but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans , which was invented ages ago in America .
and people nowadays still use jeans as a common material .
If you walk out to the street now , you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans which is incredibly surprising !
From my point of view , I think people will wear more clothes that are see - through in particular .
As people are wearing thinner and thinner clothings to show off their figure They might as well just wear clothes that are see through to give it a better effect !
so if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 year later , the only thing you can do is to WAIT !
I am writing this letter to tell you the informations you need and to ask you one or two questions .
I would like to come in july because I work in a big company where you have to take your holiday in this month .
For the accomodation at Camp California , I will prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent , and in case it has a big storm with a heavy rain it 's more resistant than a tent .
For the activities , I chose climbing because I took cours during 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level , for the other one I chose photography but I am not a proffesional , I just take some pictures in my holiday !
I have a little question , could you tell me if and how money I need to take with me , and which kind of clothes ?
I 'm writing this letter to tell you my good experience at a pop concert , last month .
When I came , I was a bit afraid because I did not know what I had to do , but a very nice girl told me that my first job was looking for people whose felt bad and to guide them to the nursery .
I did that two hours , this first job was sometimes a bit boring but I felt like someone who save people , so I was really happy !
My second was to take the money at the bars and to bring them in a little room where I could see the pop star walked in the corridor .
The next weekend I have an appointment with one them , but I do n't tell you the name because you 'll fell jalous !
Maybe I will tell you on the next letter !
I can only travel to California this July because it will be my winter holidays .
I think this way is better to keep in touch with the nature .
I would like to do photografy and swimming .
I love to take photos but I do n't have techinique .
I have always swam and I can say I 'm good on it .
I 'm looking forward from hearing from you ,
We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping .
Is a kind of relief for them .
Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves , like clothes , jewelery , anything .
Specially if we do n't have to worry about money .
It 's good to walk around looking all the news in the stores .
But , sometimes , go shopping can have other effects on you .
When you buy something you were looking for a long time and , when you arrive at home , you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain .
It is just terrible when the sellers do n't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store .
And , a really bad thing is , after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that , you realize that you spent more money than you should ...
It would probably be better if you just go shopping when you really need and , to relax , you can talk to a friend , read a book or listen to good music .
Remember : go shopping is not always the better choice .
I have received the letter which tells me that have won first prize in your competition .
I am going to write about information which you want to know .
First , I would like to travel in only July , because I have got a job and only July is the time I can have a vacation .
Secondly , I would like to choose a tent for accommodation , because I have never spent time in a tent , that 's why , I think it is a good oppotunity for me .
I would like to choose swimming and photography for activities .
I have a planty of experience and knowledge of both aspect of part .
One of them is that what kind of clothes suitable on this camp .
Another one is that how much money I have to prepare .
I will be greatfull if you could inform me .
Your sincerely
I helped a pop concert as a charity .
My jobs were collecting a ticket , saling goods and refreshment , guiding people to a right seat and cleaning up the concert hole after finish a concert .
I was n't allowed to help a heavy work , even though I wanted to do , because I 'm woman .
What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert had achived by our supports .
It seemed that all people , audience , the band and stuffs were delightful .
If I have chance , I want to help a concert again .
I have never felt such as satisfaction .
I really recomend you to help them , I think this is a good oppotunity and I want you understand my feeling well .
I 've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you .
I want to know your openion .
First of all , I would like to say thank you to you Mr Robertson for planning to take us to spend three days in London .
Your programme looks very interesting , especially the River Trip to Greenwich , which I always dreamt of .
However , we have seen an advertisement on the English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
The show will have latest fashions from top fashion designers in the world .
Leisure show will have leisure and sports wear , new make up style and new hair style for next year .
We would like to ask you whether we can change some programme .
We wo n't miss any programme that you have planned and we could also have great opportunity to see the show .
Yours faithfully .
In my opinion , everybody wants to have a happy life in our own world , we want to do whatever we want , sometimes we do the right things and sometimes we do the wrong things .
We are ordinary people , we work and come home to have activities with our family or go out together .
The politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work .
Although , their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of public so that people will never forget them .
On the other hand , their story always make them embarras because most of the journalists create their own story base on the true story just to get attraction from people .
I think , if the journalist want to publish the politicians and film stars private life , they should have asked for permission .
They deserve to have a private life as everybody .
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre "
I went to see it on time as it was written 19:30 but it started t 20:15 with a delay of 45 minutes .
What is more , about the tickets , discounts were not available as it was not said so .
As well as you can understand I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money for a nonsense thing .
Therefore , if avaliable , can you play my money back please ?
My address is here for any contacts ,
He told everything that Pandora said , to everyone which Pandora did n't want them to know .
Pandora had done something very bad like a robbery and one day told this to Pat because she was very shy and regretful .
Pat was her best friend so she told to him .
One day while all their friends were there and talking , Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery .
All of them were schoked by what they heard .
As well as this they started to talk about it everywhere .
After a week of holiday , when Pandora returned she learned that every of her friends knew that .
She became very shy and engry She could n't talk with people and she just was very sad .
Finally , she could n't wait and wear to talk to Pat .
He admitted that it was his fault to say and told everyone that it was a joke to make Pandora a bit angry .
After all they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets .
Dear Sir / Madam ;
Yesterday I went to the theatre play called " Over the Rainbow " which I saw the advertisement in todays Guardian .
I want to tell you that I am very dissapointed about the play .
In the advirtisement it is written that Danny Brook was in the starring .
However I did n't see him all the night .
And also it should be started at 19.30 , as I saw in the advirtisement , which has started at 20.15 !
And so far there was n't any discounts available which is written to be " available " in the advirtisement .
I went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the re - decoration progress inside .
You should have written it in the advirtisement .
And after all no one can say that I had a perfect evening out !
Absolutely it was very dissapointing .
I hope you understand me and correct your mistakes in the next advirtisement and send me my money soon !
Yours Faithfully
It is over 50 years since the production of the computer and television .
Our lifes changed since then
Today every 5 out of 10 pupil can use computer basicly .
So I watch Tv at home instead of sitting in a chair looking out of a window .
I play computer more than watching Tv when I get bored .
The internet is the world 's largest communication system ever made .
I can do anything I want such as buy Cd 's watch film or even buy food .
It is really enjable when I chat with pupil .
Internet brought a new way to my live since I started to use it .
I can reach any knowledge that I want to .
Techology is also important in one subject for me .
I ca n't have to walk to school everyday for 8 months , Cars , busses and trains are very useful in daily life .
Lots of thing would be hard and boring in my life I was living in a different time than now .
Technology brought simple solutions to my life .
I 'd like to complain about your ' Best ' musical show that I went to when I 'd a week 's holiday in London .
I felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement was n't true .
Finally , after an hour , when my term came to buy the entrance ticket , you staff said I could n't have a discount and so as anyone .
However I bought the ticket even it was more expensive because I 'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my favourite idol , Danny Brook .
But when the show started , they said Danny was n't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation I had was unlike what the advertisement said .
So what 's the point to say ' visit our restaurant after the show ' ?
I 'd a very disappointing evening and my anger influenced me for the rest of my holidays .
I 'd like to know if you can give the money back to me or I 'll write letters to all the media departments to show how tricky you were .
He went to see the headmaster and told him all the truth .
Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane to the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster after he punished Jon .
The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment , which was suspended from school for a week .
This happened in the Thursday afternoon .
When everyone finished their lunch , they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every Thursday .
But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board .
Unfortunately , one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster 's head .
He then punished Jon but the one who did was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster among us .
Pat heard that and went to see the headmaster straight after school .
The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished their bad behaviours .
After that event happened , Pat was Jon and Tim 's enemy .
They do hate him so much .
Unfortunatelly I have to complained about musical show in your 's Circle Theatre last evening .
When I become your 's advertisment concerning the show " Over the Rainbow " I thought that I 'll have a great evening , but unfortunatelly it was a big disappointment for me .
Maybe I start for the beginning .
First of all , Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was abbsend .
The show had a 45 minutes delay - what a shame !
You also offered discounts , whot kind of discounts ?
I haven't seen any !
I was with my son ( 11 years old ) and I had to paid a full - prize for his ticket .
Becouse the show was very long , we were getting hungry but of course your 's theatre restaurants was closed because of holiday .
Hereby I have to ask for money back or another discounts for me .
Waiting for you replay .
The stay has begaun last year , when I stated my summer holiday .
I had not any money for travelling but my parents were able to give me them if I only had a concret plans .
I started talking with my parents that I will be travelling with my friends through West - Europe for one month .
I had really a good plan but any good friends .
I become quite a lot of money and I left home .
During one week I was really travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone .
Sometimes I had to sleep on a railway - stations or under a bridges .
After one mounth I came home back and explained my parents how a lot of fun had I with my friends - I do n't know why I was such a lair .
My parents belived my word 's untill my younger brother Pat told them the true .
Now my parents ' do n't belive my words .
But I think , this was a good lesson for me and I lair any more .
The reason for which I decided to write you a letter , will , I guess , surprise you .
I hope you will not feel offensed , but I really needed to contest about your theater .
It was very excited thinking about being at the theatre , and I though with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening .
Plus , I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play : he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschool and perchance I have found him back here !
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it !
Moreover ; it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19.30 ; it actually started at exactly 20.15 !
45 minutes latter : where we had nothing to do , but waiting .
Really , what a mess in the administration .
Although , I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket , as you mentionned in the advertisement , but unfortunately , these could n't possibly be reached either !
I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back , so you do not lose a faithful client .
If more and more ingenors work on science and technology , it must be that it is really usefull : but in what particular way ?
For my part , I know it would be such a pain in my neck .
I guess I could not live without many instruments .
The first I think of is internet .
It allows me to learn anything without having to travel through many libraries as I used to do .
It also makes me write to my friends by e - mail .
I did not to write at all to people until I have got internet .
By this procedure , you only type and send , no need to going to the post - office !
Of course this is just because I am lazy , I actually could force me a little , and then go to the library and to the post - office , but internet just makes it easier !
These are also such a relief .
I can go anywhere without being nervous about the fact , that maybe someone is trying to reach me !
Nevertheless , this easy life has then offered me to be more peaceful and I think it is essential .
Although I am thankful to modern technology !
I am writing to thank you to send me all the details about my prize and I 'd like to give you a complete information about the journey will be done by myself .
I would like to travel at the beginning of the month , could be between first and fifteeth of july , because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip .
Related with accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins .
Although I like camping and sharing with different kind of people , I 'd prefer a confortable and private place ( if it 's possible ) where I can sleep , or be quiet .. I am not a teenager !
Really , this prize is wonderful to have a healthy life .
I want to do two activities ; painting and tennis .
The first one is for my mental health , I need a break in my style of life .
the second one is just because I 'm fanatic of that sports ( really I 'm not martine hingis ) .
Eventually , I 'd like to request to have special food , because and vegetarian person , besides I try to eat just organic food .
I hope my reply has been suitable .
It have been a long time since the last time I wrote you ... I 'm sorry .
However the reason is absolutely amazing .
I was training to be a personal assistance to Madonna herself .
Maybe , you do n't believe me , but it 's true .
I applied to the job and she selected me between hundreds of candidates ( I do n't receive salary ) .
My work is to help her during each concert .
You know , she has a brilliant performance where she must change her customs , make up , scenery , everytime ; so she needs a lot of people near .
My first job was in the Hillsborough 's concert ( I think , you heard about it ) .
I was running all the show , my responsability was to get dress her .
I was n't alone , I worked with a staff of ten people .
We had to take of some clothes and then to put on others ones completly different , in just few minutes ( similar to Formula One ) .
I was exhausted when the concert finished , anyway it has been one of my best experience and I 'll remember for life .
Finally , I send you all my positive energy and I am looking forward to receiving your letter back .
I spent two days at annual international arts festival from 21 to 22 of November .
This festival was well - orginised .
I relly liked exhibitions .
I had a chance to see amazing pictures with wezy painted by Russian painters .
The Band " Three Kings " apresented new stily of music .
I would like to notice that a dance show was absolutelly marvelous .
What 's a greit idea to invite writers there ! I relly liked to speak with them .
From my point of view I can complain only on a small concert hall and there were artist from only six countries .
Nowadays many people fond of classical music , but this concert was too small that 's why many people had to miss this classical concert .
You wrote an advertisment that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert , but there were artists only from 6 countries .
It was relly pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy .
The International Arts Festival was organised quite well . I would only recomended you to have more artists and a classical concert should be in bigger hall than it was .
One man and one woman lived in small house beside the sea .
There names were Ivan and Maria .
They were so pour that somitimes they hardly had something to eat .
It was n't usual fish , it was Gold Fish and it asked him as human ; ' Please , let me go and I can do for you anything you want ' .
But Ivan was so kind person that he let Gold Fish went without any condition .
He told her wife about this story .
She was angry and she said that Ivan was just foolish man .
She persuide him to go to the sea to ask a lot of things for her .
Gold Fish did everything what Ivan asked .
When he come back home , he was surprise because Maria was more angry than before .
She said that it was n't enough what Gold Fish had done for her .
In the end , greedy Maria wanted impossible thing .
She said that Ivan should bring Gold Fish to home and Ivan could leave this house because she did n't need him anymore .
Maria wanted too much and Gold Fish returned everything at the beginning .
Maria and Ivan were again poor .
I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre .
I had spent the hole last week in London with one of my colleagues .
We thought that going to the musical show " Over The Rainbow " was ( as you say in your advertisement ) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city .
But from the beginning we found a lot of problems .
Despite we are actors we had to pay a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays .
We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite .
However , we decided to get into the show .
Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise .
You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny , but Peter Fox , who was on the stage .
Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant , where we were supposed to meet some friends ; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out .
I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing - hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late .
As you can read it was not our " perfect evening out " at all .
I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you the money of the tickets back .
Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement , before the starting time of the show .
I am waiting your answer ,
My composition is going to focus in two main ideas : how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life .
Technology makes easier the work at home .
During the winter , when it is raining , you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes .
I am thinking mostly on computers .
The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a big amount of information in the minimum space .
Also , the e - mail system is really hepful .
Thanks to the advance of Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday ( and with the minimum cost ) .
But , on my opinion , the best thing is that I can stay at home or going on holidays , and send my work to the office everyday .
I would like to travel only in July because I have been working in a bank and I can only go on a holiday in July .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in the tent .
Therefore I would like to try some kind of experience .
I am interested in tennis but I am not so good tennis player .
However I would like to attend tennis activity .
In addition swimming would be good activity for me .
While I was studying at the high school and the university , I was in the swimming team of the school .
I would like to ask you about clothes and the money .
When I go there , can I use credit card or should I have cash ?
When you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they do n't like shopping but I suppose it is not true .
For example me , when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I had n't liked it .
However now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be " yes , I like it " .
When people hear this word shopping they only think about to go some stores and try new clothes or shoes and search for their size and so on .
They do n't think about other kind of shopping which are liked by themselves .
Maybe they like shopping on internet or window shopping does n't matter what kind of shopping they like .
There are a lot of shopping style on the world I am sure everybody prefer one of them .
In my opinion , even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable , there are always some fun you can find .
Circle Theater
I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week 's holiday in London .
My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about the show " Over the Rainbow " which is very popular .
When we asked for discounts tickets , we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay the highest tickets - £ 20 each - because we were not English students .
We were annoyed about it but we paid off .
We had to wait 8.15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm !
After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed .
Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined , it was definitely not the " perfect evening " as written in the adverstiment .
So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers , and avoid false advertisement .
Your children clothes in 100 years
Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true .
In a hundred years , clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours .
Materials , textures and colours change , and are minds too .
So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things , like bottles of aluminium .
I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans .
Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on .
But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed : large pants as " baggy " , or trousers with many pockets as we see today .
For women , clothes change more than for men 's .
It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes .
I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt , or more male clothes because they want to change .
Finally it 's very difficult to say that .
Maybe Luc Besson 's " Fifth Element " movie is quite a good example .
To conclude , in the end clothes wo n't be what we think about today , and it 's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy .
This trip will be very important for me , that is why I am interested in travelling to U.S.A as soon as possible .
I would like to travel on July because I will be on winter holidays , so I will not miss classes at school .
I would really prefer to stay in tents because I love sleeping outdoors and listening noises from outside .
I was wondering the kind of clothes that I will have to wear and finally could you tell me how much money I will have to take ?
I look for ward to receiving more news .
I 'm writing because I know that you 're interested in listening my experience in which I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month , perhaps in the future you 'll be able to help too .
If you want to help at a pop concert you 'll have to write down yourself in a competition as I did , then , if you win the organiser will phone you and you 'll be able to help them .
At the concert I had to clear and organized all the people who were in , but at the end of the night I was able to talk with one of my favourite pop singer .
I think that it was the experience I particularly liked most and which I will never forget .
According to your letter , I should tell you when I would like to travel and I think July is the best time for me because I will be on summer vacations so I would not have to miss any classes .
About the accomodation , I would prefer tents because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities .
As I may choose the two activities I would like to practise during my staying at the Camp from the list given in your letter , I choose singing and photography .
I have been taking singing classes since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it .
On the other hand , I am a beginner in photography skills .
I would appreciate if you could inform me if I have to bring any money for extra costs or even special kind of clothes for those activities .
These days people have been shopping more often than they used to .
Sometimes shopping can be a stressing experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives .
First of all , shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have , even if it is just for a moment .
On the other hand , sometimes you can get really nervous about shopping like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants .
It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something .
Furthermore , sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product .
In conclusion , like all things in life , shopping can be pleasent or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day .
At first , I want to say how I am happy to have won this prize and I want to thank you .
Concerning the information you want I will give them .
I would like to travel on July because this is the only month given to me by my employer .
Concerning the two activities I have to choose , I would prefer to swim and play tennis ( I have a good level in each sports ) .
Finally I would like to know how much money I have to prepare and which sorts of clothes are usually weared in California .
Many classes and activities are important in our school But I have to make a choice in order to select them The class of mecanics seem to be the more important lesson .
It use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes .
It gives us the knowledge usefull for many school club like the " marathon shell " club or the robotich club .
Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier It lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer .
But there are other lessons very important ( like English of course ! )
Actually , I have a regret , there is no ethic lessons , It would show us how use our knowledge .
I am writing you to give you the information you need , but first of all I would say that I am really delighted and I would thank you .
If it would be possible I wish I travel in July because I have planned my holidays this month at work and I would not be able to remove them for accommodation , I would choice the log cabin , I am not very fond of " adventure " , that is why tents are not for me .
I expect that these two weeks will be as a big rest .
Third , you need to know which sport I want to to practise .
I would choice photography and tennis .
( I guess that you should n't borrow some !
About tennis , I play for eight years and I am used to sit for competition .
To finish , I wonder if I need to bring some money or if all has been already payed and what kind of clothes should I bring ?
Our engineer school is specealized in mecanics and thermodynamics .
Needless to said that we must faces our attention to these fields .
First , we could film fluid mecanics lessons and general mecanics lessons .
I wonder if we could not feet between some short view of the laboratories , in which we could show student making experimentations .
In order to strike people who will watch the film , we could record student drawing on the big drawing tables . I would do the same for thermodynamics .
Nevertheless , we should not forget the extra - life school . We have to show sports at school and all activities that we are offered .
There are not only the brain which should be trained .
Futur students could appreciate to come if they could still practise their sport .
Another point to record woubl be the time we have got between lessons or at lunch time , it will show a part of the way of life in the school .
If you want further information or if you disagree , tell me it .
Dear Madame ,
I have received your letter about the competition ' two weeks at Camp California ' - I am very glad to know to have won the first prize !
In the following you can find , I hope , call the information you need to complete the partecipation procedure .
I would like to travel only on July because , as you already know , at the moment I am following a doctoral course at the Cornell University : this school is closed on July and so , in that period , I am available for the camp .
If possible , the accomodation I prefer is in tent .
there are two main reasons for the choice : I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the relative activities : building - up the tent , cooking on camp and so on .
Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the camp daily life ( the tent , the sleep bag and so on . ) .
Indeed , I like the water sport and I am a quite good guitar singer - Some questions : What about the average temperature at the camp on July ?
What are the better clothes to use at the camp ?
How much money may be useful at the camp ?
I will be very glad to partecipate to your camp !
Yours faightfully
Our school , as it is well known , is a technical school and consequently the daily life contains different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories .
A short video , showed to the English class , must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school .
Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to create the video .
The mathematical lessons are divided in two part : the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained .
Two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistry .
These activities are very interesting and they will be surely enclosed in the video .
Moreover , many sport activities are performed in our school : swimming , tennis , gym , jogging and so on .
Some parts of the final video may describe these additional features of the school .
I would like to say " thank you " for this London trip plan .
Especially the boat trip on river is a good idea because we all want to see Greenwich .
We also enjoy the idea of going to the National Art Gallery and sightseeing by bus .
It seems it 's going to be a great fun .
I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in " Time Out " magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see .
The show 's date is very convinient - March 14 - , and it is on Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there .
As you know , we all come from different countries and we are keen on learning some other things about English culture besides the language itself .
Joining this fashion and leisure show , we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things , such as new hair styles and make up ways , or what is fashion in London recently .
We can find another chance to go to the Science Museum in any other day , but this show is just for this Tuesday .
I hope , it would n't cause a trouble to change the programme .
Although human is a social creature , all people need an area to be able to stay away from other people .
I believe this feeling sources from a strange though ; when somebody gets famous , whatever the job is they do , we think we have some kind of right over them .
Press takes this demand as an order , and " but public wants to know " becomes a nightmare for famous people .
Because they have to spend too much time in front of other people , they are even more sensitive about their privacy .
I am quiet sure , even the ones , who have chosen their occupies just to be famous , do n't like to be pictured when they believe they are alone .
The situation much be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this .
Obviously , there is no point in saying " famous people have a right to their own live . "
Although this statement is absuletely true , it seems there is no way to stop public attention , so they will keep living with journalists .
My name is Marcia Fomalar , I am writting to make you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical show of the London theatre .
I went to buy the ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near of the stage I bought a £ 20 tiket but when I asked for the discount they told me " I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement , It will be impossible to make you a discount " .
At 19:15 I was very impatient waiting for the show begins and a man anounced that the show will start at 20:15 .
The reason they gave me it was closed because it was being repaired .
Finaly the show started and to my sorprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor .
Now what I hope is you refound me my money , it was a horrible evening out
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I would be the best party of the year .
Last month was my grandmother birthday and I organised a party for her .
My grandmother loves the parties and when she was young she used to organise big parties for all the family and friends .
Now she is 85 years old so she ca n't do that but , I can .
I organised everything like : the place , the food , the decoration , I sent letters by post to everybody she knows .
It seems to be the bigger party of her life .
I thought she could have a show in this special party so I talked to Pat , my best friend , if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. programes .
She loved the idea and said she had differents shows so to decide which could be the most suitable .
I told her to make me a phone cold .
Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended .
But after all the party was great .
I am writing to reply on your letter concerned about the holidays at Camp California in the U.SA as a first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month .
First of all , I want to know if it is possible to travel in July because during that month I will be free from the school 's activities so my parents just let me go if I do not have to miss any of my classes .
About the activities that I have to choose , I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports , but I think the best option is swimming because I have been practicing it during 5 years so I want to keep on it .
The other activity that I chose is painting , I am not as well as I want , nevertheless I think I can inprove my skills during this course .
I would rather tends than log cabins for accommodation because the last summer I had the great opportunity to be in a log cabin and now I want to know the other one .
I am sure it will be thrilling to stay near the nature and at the same time , it would be a new experience for me .
I would like to know how is the weather in California during the summer to bring with me appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know , is the amount of money that I have to bring with me .
If you need more information , please do not hesitate on writing me .
To make easier and faster this report , it was necessary to make a questionarie which was gave out in the school .
1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre , the listening room room and the library because as everybody knows , they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places helping them to improve their English on their own .
2 - They also think , that filming some of the lessons that they usually have , known as " one - to - one " lessons , people who see this video , will be interested on knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes .
3 - The least but not the last , a lot of students ( almost 85% ) think that the extra - activities organised by the social programme , has became really exciting , so they suggest filming these activites during the weekend , for example " the full day in Oxford " because for those that did not have the opportunity to go there , could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time .
However , 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying and they mentioned it as not really important .
As you can see , my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have .
Despite of being almost 300 students , the answers were quite similar .
I do recommend to pay attention to the food in the cafeteria because even though it was not the main reason of this report , they also wrote complaning about that .
If you need more information and the sheets that I collected , please do not hesitate on asking me for them .
Few weeks ago , me and my farmily had a hoilday in London , the hoilday was n't too good !
During the week we descide where we want to go , we all agree to listen to music so than we descide to come to your musical show and listen to " Over the Rainbow " .
That evening we do n't want to have our supper before the show Anyway I though it will be too early to eat and also because the time table or canidates you give me have say : " visit our theatre restaurant after the show " .
so we did , but unforturnily it was close and I was so dissapointed about it , nor only that we have expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actor of starring .
Also I do n't really mind that the show start late but the rute of that evening was rucented .
And there were no discounts when you say there is !
Why is it every thing that on the canidates were wrong and different what we had .
We do n't expect much bad to happened in our hoilday , but this was perfectic show as well , it was the worstest show and theatre I have never been in my life .
P.S. please would you like to explain why ?
We would like our money back please because every thing gone wrong , the atmosphere totally chanced !

Modern technology changed our daily life
In order to live happily the sciencetist can easily perdict the changes on earth , so than we can have time to perpare or defence our self from the Natural diseasters .
Wapons were designed to kill and defences in a fright , in War 1945 so many German were killed , also many people die from other region .
e.g. The Englishs .
Posin chemical compounds e.g. gases , liquids , are created too , they were use to kill people , most of them give radiration which can disable the person , mostly harm their brain and their bodys and it could also cause deaths .
Communication techology e.g. internet ( networks ) , moible phones .
In the wars soilors were communicate with moible phones though places to place to get or give information about them self and the enarmys .
By using internet we could make new pen friends oversea , creat club , sociatys .
Now megsage can travel quicker and it is also world wild . send letters takes about aweek to HongKong from U.K. , but net work eg .
E - mail .
require time is about few minutes .
Now we could even create a club in Yahoo , which is free .
Modern technology save us alot of times and give us many benifects when we use it in a right correct ways , but some bad way to e.g. send virse to break down network .
I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going to this trip .
Accommodation in log cabins would be better for me , because they are more comfortable .
Many people enjoy going shoppings meeting friends and mainly spending their money , but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience .
The good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure , provided you are not in a hurry .
On the other hand , when the shops are crowded ( for instance , just before Christmas ) , going shopping can be very stressful , as you can not walk freely and have to bear endless queues .
As if these were not enough , there are always impolite assistants , who make your day even worse .
I 'm writing this letter to express the reasons of our disappointment about that evening .
The advertisement for the show said that there was discounts available for children so we brought them and when we bought the tickets we had to pay the maximum price for everyone .
My husband was looking for to seeing his favourite actor , Danny Brook , and when the show started he found out that Brook had been changed by a different actor .
When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack to the theatre restaurant and it was closed without giving any reason for it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party was n't as succesful as we thought .
My and my friends , including Pat , were preparing a surprise for Sam 's birthday .
We decided to go to his place ( I 've got a copy of the key ) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounch , then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived .
Everybody was excited about the idea and we were keeping it in secret in front of Sam .
We were having a wonderful time chatting and laughing but suddenly the phone rang and Pat answer it .
It was her aunt inviting her for the weekend so Pat said very loudly : " I 'm sorry but I have to go to Sam 's flat and decorate it , it 's a surprise , do n't tell anybody "
Sam look at us surprised and said " What 's going on ? "
Everybody had to change plans and the party became a normal party .
We were a bit disappointed but we enjoyed anyway .
With reference to our trip in London , in name of all of us , English class in this college , we would like to thank you for your special atention in have organised a good programme to know interesting and cultural points in London .
We have been very excited about this and coincidentely we have found another option to add in our programme , certainly if your agree with .
We have thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformation in nowdays in England about fashions , Leisure , sports and style of life .
However your decision in changing a little bit our programme , we would suggest just on Tuesday afternoon no doing shop , everything else could stay the same .
We are really satisfied in sightseeing by bus , in go to the National Gallery , but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion and will be free .
It was dangerous , but I kew I had to do it .
This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998 , it was n't 13th even it look liked , but it was my 25th birthday .
Everything was going so bad and I knew , I could die .
Unfortunately , I 've got a brother who likes to live in dangerous and poor way and I do n't know how , but he could persuade me to go with him to get some drugs , in my 25th birthday .
I was at home making me up before to go to a restaurant with my friends and , sudenlly , he rang the bell , he was so nervous with a gun in his hands and no longer I could speak he took me out with him .
I had tried to think in stopping him , but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scared me and he forced me to buy cocain using my cheques .
I did n't want , I 've never approve his deal with the drug , but I could n't do it different .
The dangerous man who we 'd gone to buy drugs was upset with my brother and had decided to kill him , but I had killed him first .
If I did n't do it , I knew I would die , my option was my life , but now I haven't any chance to live because I 'm in the prison .
I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , wich you are the manager .
I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show .
The first problem concerned the main actor of the show .
Although it was written in the show 's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook , it , unfortunately , was not him .
The show was supposed to have started at 19:30 , but it only started at 20:15 , so the public , including me , was forced to wait for fourty five minutes .
It was also written in the show 's addvertisement that there would be discounts available for the tickets .
However , there was not any .
Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show , it was closed and no explanations were given .
In conclusion , the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out , but it was not , so I would like to ask for my money back .
I all happened a year ago , when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything .
One day , I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe , the school 's hunk and most popular boy .
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love .
Suddenly , an enourmous saddness caught me , because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone , so he would definately brake up with me , and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat , because she had just ruined my happiness and I could n't trust her anymore .
I am writing to you about an incident I had with the musical show which was presented by your theatre during my week 's holiday in London .
First of all , I would like to tell you that it was very disappointing for me that the starring was not Danny Brook as your company had published .
Moreover , the musical show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15 .
As the show finished later , we decided to eat something at your theatre restaurant but to our surprise , it was closed .
An other thing is that there was any discount available so we spend a lot of money in such a bad show .
I hope this kind of behaviour does not happen again .
Your faithfully ,
One day , while I was studying maths , one of my friends , called Pat , asked me to have a coffe with her .
We went to a place called ' Deli ' where we talked a lot about our school , the exams and , as we usually did , about our friends and boy friends .
Such as the most important thing that had happened to us in our life and that kind of secrets ...
The problem started when I confesed her that I had fall in love with Larry , who was my cousin 's boyfriend .
In spite of the fact that I told her to keep it as a secret , she went to my cousin 's house and made the retelling of what I had exactly told her .
As a result , my cousin went to my house in order to gave her a detailed description of it .
As I solved the trouble with my cousin , I understood why my mother had told me that ' friends ' sometimes were n't as you expected them to be .
I had looked forward to go and see " London 's newest and best musical show " -Over the Rainbow .
Surprizingly there was a complete different actor starring .
I was looking forward to take benefit from the discounts available , but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available .
Unfortunatly the restaurant was closed .
I have heard that they will read " The Old Man and the Sea " on the radio P1 on Wednesday next week .
He is only aiming for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days .
He get a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catched .
On his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eats his catched fish pice by pice .
The fisherman kills many sharks with different weapons , but when he reaches port there is only head , tail and bones left of the huge swordfish .
He make you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks .
I really think you should take your time and listen to it on the radio on Wednesday next week .
I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many problems .
Firstly , the start time was at 19.30 p.m , but the play started at 20.15 p.m. People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them apart from me were rather nervous .
Secondly , the well - known star Danny Brook was n't there , but a different actor I had never heard from him .
From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that was impossible to fine another with the same features .
As far as the tickets is concerned no discounts were available , so , moreover I found it expensive .
After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink .
At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work .
The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you for returning my money , as I think it is fair .
But this time things have gone too far .
I 've know Pat since we were kids .
Little by little we were growing up and becaming close friends .
I relyied on her and our relationship was excellent .
I considered her my best friend and I thought we would never drift apart but now my mind have changed , because she has done something I ca n't approve .
She has given away to my mother that I told her a lie as far as the weekend was concerned .
Pat told her I had n't spent those days with her , but with my boyfriend in the mountain .
My mother was so hungry and she told off me so hard that I will remember it the rest of my life .
Moreover I was punished hardly by my father and now we do n't talk each other .
Since then I haven't seen Pat anymore and she seems not regret that happened , so I 'll try to forget her and carry on my life that 's all .
I am so happy to win the prize and come true my dream .
I would like to travel to California this July , because I can take an holiday from 14th to 27th of July .
I have never used it and I think it would be more exciting than tents .
I have heard that the Camp California is famous for surfing , so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time .
Besides , I will take the chance to play golf .
It is my only favorite hobby .
I do n't know what the weather is like , and you are paid for travel costs , but I am wondering that it is included two activities .
Please , let me know this questions as soon as possible .
To reply your answer , it was realy an nice experience .
As you know , I like a pop music so much and singer was one of my favorite singers .
Also , in the future I 'll want to be an organizer like this concert , so it 'll be useful the experience to me .
I am writing how I got the position and what I did .
In the pop concert , there were many people , so before starting the pop concert , I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments .
It was somewhat hard to me .
I am now writing to give you all information you require .
On August I am going to apply for a new job .
Another consideration are activities .
I would be most greatful if you could let me know some information :
- How to get to Camp California from airport ?
- How far from city - centre the camp is situated ?
- How much money I have to take with me ?
- What kind of clothes would you recommend me to bring with me ?
- Are there leisure and intertainments facilities close to the camp ?
Attituds to the video about life at our school
The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil 's attituds about video they have to be made and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
The report is based on opinion of more than 300 pupils .
According to the answer there are the most important activities pupils would like to film ( 80 per cent of those questioned )
- lessons in Mathematics and History , because pupils have very good exam 's result .
- lessons in dancing , because 80 per cent girls attend the Dancing Club
- competition in basketball , because our school 's team won first prize in our gerian .
- pupils ' travel to London , during the last holiday , because it was great !
- Also they would like to film the pat corner at school , because they enjoy taking care of animals .
Conclusion : It is clear , that the filming of video is very important event for children , and pupils would prefer to film only positive events of their life at school as I have written above .
I would now like to answer the information you requested .
Besides , I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience to sleep in the middle of the nature .
I am especially glad about the activities offers , in particular the sports facilities because I was spezialised in sport for my A - levels and intend to become a sport teacher .
I have been playing Basketball for many years but I would appreciate to improve my skills , in particular the ball - handling .
Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly await having the possibility to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect in crawl .
I know I have already asked a lot but there is one more thing I need to know which kind of clothes will be appropriate and how much money will I approximately need ?
how are you doing ?
Here , everything is as usual : School , studying , eating , sleeping - but did I tell you about my latest job ?
I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you ca n't imagine how exciting it was !
But at the end I handled it almost automatically .
Before the performance I introduced the spectators to their seats and then a instructor showed me how to lead the spotlights .
I really had butterflies in my stomach when I was responsible for the lightening !
But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers back stage !
He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me for his next concert !
Perhaps I could help regularly in the lightening area - it would help me for my studies of photography .
I can hardly await your reply !
Lot 's of Love ,
I am really surprise for the information because I won , and I like to tell you thank you for everyting this is why I wrote and send this letter with the information you need , only I can travel in July because it is the only time with I can do it before for my work , really I do not care which accommodation will I can have , I am prefer the accommodation in July I will be avaliabel for the moment , I am really apreciated if you can tell to the people who work in Camp California , I choose the Golf and Photography because I think I am really interesting in that object I am no really really good but I have some of studies .
I would like to ask you what kind of clothes I need to take for the place and for the weather follow for the money , how much money I need to take ?
I think it is everyting I like to know .
Thank you very much for you time .
How are you ? I hope you are fine like the same for me .
I like to apologise with you , because I did n't wrote to you recently , but I like to tell you what hapend to me in the last weak I had the opportunity to help in one of the most pop concert in my city , so imagen , I fell really really good and exating for that I do n't have words for describe but I try to do it , OK ?
They need one girl to put make up to the stars of the group , so I do it , I was talking with the manager and the people inside the group so I meet a lot of people and it 's good for my curriculum vitae as well but the best for my it 's was when one of the group they with me one rose for my work am really proud about them !
I really enjoy that kind of day what about you ? I need to get out know , I keep in touch .
loves and kisses .
I am writing to you in reply to your letter about my willing the first prize in your competition .
First of all , I would like to thank the jury for chosen my work from all the competitors .
If I had known that I won , I would not have arranged my english course in Britain .
Before .
I am very close to the nature , so it will be a pleasure for me .
What 's more , your letter said about the chance to do for two acctivities during the camp .
I have even won competion once .
I would like to know if the , , travel costs '' which you had paid for include entrance tickets to the museums ' or any other cultural places , because I would like to some sightseeing in the U.S.A. Furthermore , if there will be cmy tumple dryer or washing maschine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp .
When discribing the advantages , we should remember that most people like doing shopping .
It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding , birthday , Christmas presents .
Next , it can be very good for your wallet to save some money , when you will find a bargain or sales .
As well as that , some shop - assistance can give you a lower price , because you always do shopping at their shop .
On top of that , shopping is very tiring and exhausting .
Instead of that you could do more interesting things . such as playing sports or reading a book .
Besides that , shopping steal you from money .
Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need .
When I have to , I do it , but I think we waste too much time on it that we should .
From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not .
Referring to the won competition , I would say that I am very happy to be the first .
First , you asked abut the travel time and the only possible time for me is in July , because my company only gave me holidays in this period .
Second , I prefer accommodation in tent . I want to feel the real nature and spirit of Camp California .
Further more , I should choose between two activities and how good I am at each one .
I choose singing and surfing , singing because I am a singer in a band and I hope to make my voice more perfect and surfing because I have never surf and I want to learn to .
Finally , I have some questions . I would know what type of clothes I should bring with me ?
Is it possible to travel with a friend of mine ?
How are you ? I hope fine .
Me , fine , because of helping at the concert ' The Dome ' .
First I have help to cook coffee and make food for popular people like Mariah Carey , Elton John , Backstreet Boys , Echt ect ...
Before and after the concert the " stars " are very hungry and I have serve them food , drinks and something like this .
Kim , check it in your mind , I have had near contact with Mariah Carey !
Different " stars " gave me signatures and talk really nice and normal with me .
At the time the concert was running I cleaned the kitchen and the room where the " stars " ate .
The after show dinner party was very nice and I have never thought that popular people like Elton John dances on the table if he likes the music and if he have made a great show on stage .
It was just great and after this event I can say that popular people are normal humans like everyone !
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about somethings that happened in the performance of the show Over the Rainbow , wich took place in your stablishment , The Circle Theater , that made me feel very upset .
I was very exited to see it yesterday , but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began .
I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket , as the leaflet says , however it did not happen .
After that , I became even more angry because , as far as I concerne , the show must begin on time , but it started forty five minutes late .
Finally , the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but others I have never seeing before , and the restaurant was closed with no advise .
At last , for all these reasons my evening was horrible , and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible .
Yours Sincerelly ,
In our days , technology has become a very common thing , even among children .
It is such an evolution for human race , however we can not forget that it can cause some problems too .
Firstly , the great boom of massive comunication wich happened in the beginning of our decade , with the devellopment of telephones , radio stations , television and even satelites , and of course , the internet , gave common people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world , and this provided health and education researches to increase as well .
In the other hand , technology has made the differences between - poor and rich people to grow at a high level , and this is one of the biggest causes of violence in all countries .
I addition to that , people will always be affraid of the technological war .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people must learn that despite technology being such a new area to explore , we have to use it with a great amount of responsability , for us all to survive in the future .
Thanks for your letter , I am so glad that I have won first prize in your competition .
And thanks again for offer me two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I used to sleep in tent once on my holiday , and tent is more suitable for camping .
It is very kind for you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp .
I 'd like to have climbing and sailing .
For sailing , well , I haven't try it before , that is why I want to have a try .
As you said , all accommodation and travel costs are paid for , but I am sure I still need some money with me .
How much do you think that I will need .
By the way what kinds of clothes do you think I have to get with me ?
And is there anything eles I have to get with me ?
I think most people will agree with " shopping is not always enjoyable " .
Some people might say women just love shopping , they could n't stop thinking about doing shopping .
Yes , it is true , this is only because nowadays people have more money than even before , and some women do n't earn money , they have no idea how diffcult to earn the money .
Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs , will those women still thinking shopping is enjoyable !
So it is depend on different case .
For me , I do n't think shopping is enjoyable at all .
I only go to shop unless I really need something .
Shopping is just like a nightmare to me , I think I will never understand why people love shopping .
How can you face the same goods at the same shop all the time .
Some women spend their whole life doing shopping , and most of times , they do n't buy many things .
In my eyes they are wasting their lifes , they are hopeless .
Those are only my opinions , you do n't need to agree with it , but one day you might found out that what I have said is not totally wrong .
I am writing to you to give some opinions of mine abut The International Arts Festival .
It was a great idea and I had the pleasure of resting and relaxing , plus of getting some important knowledge from it .
Stars and artists wee only from six countries
3 . I think that there were not enough plays and films .
To sum up I want to tell you bout my suggestions for next year 's festival .
It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms with signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival .
Also I think that dance shows should include different styles of dancing ( e.g. national dancing of all the countries ) to impress audience and not to bore with the similar scenes .
I hope this letter will help you in organying
Yours faithfully
It is a pleasure for me to communicate with such a friend as you are .
Every puple has to sit alone ( I mean that one desk is given for one man )
2 . One should have such marks as , , 3 " , , , 4 " , , , 5 " not , , 2 " which is eaqual to fail .
These rules are strict and certainly we have endless number of just - so - called rules . I do n't think you will be interested in them .
Truely speaking I am not sure about home rules . I think that in our family everything is based on mutual understanding .
We do n't have old - traditioned rules or something alike .
I have just received your letter and I want to thank you for all this information that you giving me .
Fist of all , it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is hotest mounth in the year , and the weather shall be really nice .
Secondly , I think it is would be better to stay tents , so than we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play in .
However , as you asked me to choose two activities , I 'm choosing swimming and climbing , because I 'm very good at swimming and I would like to try myself at climbing .
Despite the small expereance in climbing I do want to try this type of sport .
In addition , I would like to know how much money do I have to bring with me .
I think that it is all what I would like to know .
I 'm looking forward to hear from you .
The aim of this report is to suggest wich lessons and other activities should be filmed .
I have enterwed each student from my English class .
Fistly , the English lesson must be filmed as the most interesting lesson at our school because it will give to students an interest to study and improve their noleges .
Also you can have a good practice with English with students , who came from different countries .
Dear Ms Jane Clark ,
I am writing to express my profound gratitude for an excellent organisation of an annual international arts festival , where I spent two days .
Besides , I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more .
For a start I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories , both realistic and unusual , they make us thoughtful and form our outlook , they make us feel and think .
As far as I am concerned , I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite the fact what sort of book it is .
Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and people around us .
However , reading an unusual , sometimes fantastic story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view .
I consider " Wuthering Heights " by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of everyday 's routine .
It is a remarkable piece of literature , which portrays deep feelings of love and hate , depicts strong and unique characters , reveals eternal concerns with good and bad , life and death .
It contributes to the world treasurehouse of literature and arouses irresistable fascination .
To draw the conclusion , I 'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantastic stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves .
i am writing to reply your questions about me .
Firstly , I would like to thank you abut this big opportunity you give me to visit this wonderful place like California .
I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a leaving for the other months of Summer .
Also , I prefer to stay in tents because I think it is a good chance for me to live with the nature and to wake up listening birds which singing .
I 'm good in both of these .
Also I like a lot music and everybody tells me that I have a good voice .
I would like ask you about the weather . I want to know if I should bring warm clothes or not and how much money .
Your sincerely
Thanks for you letter .
As you know this Summer I really enjoy myself doing things I like a lot .
Last month , Alice and her friends proposed me to help at a pop concert .
All I had to do was to prepare something to eat before the concert and to control during it about the sound .
The concert lasted four hours and in the end they wanted to pay me .
I did n't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the concert of " Savage Garden " in live and because that night was the best of my life .
But the thing I particularly liked about my experience , was the feeling when you are near and when you talk with the people so famous .
P.S. I hope you will find the spare time to visit my country this Summer .
Thuesday 13th June 2000
I 've just received your letter , and I am very delighted to be the winner .
I thank you ..
As regards to the time I would like to travel , I would like to make you aware that I can only on July because I am very tied up this time owing to he exam period which will last until the end of June .
I 'd rather have accommodation in tents , it would be a good experience for me especially because I haven't lived it as well as it is more romantic .
The swimming is my best sport .
The sea is part of myself .
Furthermore I will have the opportunity to play basketball , despite the fact that I am not too tall for this kind of sport .
However , I used to play basketball in my school because we had n't other sport pitch except of the basket pitch .
Finally , would you mind to send me more information about the amount of money that I should have .
Also , what about the life out of the camp ?
Are there other places for entertainment especially for the night life ?
Could you send me some brochures for the place where we will stay in ?
Thank you again , and I am looking forward to your reply ,
It considers two points : the lessons and activities which should be filmed .
I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher George are worth filming and showing for many reasons .
All of us participate effectively .
I want this opinion wo n't imply that the other lessons of other teachers are n't interesting .
Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables .
The pictures will be amazing and wonderful .
There are many activities that they could be filmed .
We can film our Swimming pool , despite the artificial sunbathing .
The gym is good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments that owns .
In addition , we can film the library which possesses thousand of works .
Books of various interest , with up - to - date facilities such as computers internet , CD and cassettes .
We should n't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college , especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear .
It will be a good advertising , and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better .
Therefore I am going to write them down .
First , I 'd like to travel on July because my friend , who is French , is coming to Toronto on August .
Second , I prefer log cabins than tents .
Because I 've started surfing since 1998 and I 'm keen on surfing .
Also , painting is one of my favorite things !
I know everything is included and I do n't need to pay anything but in case should I bring some money or not ?
And if I need to bring some money could you suggest me the amount ?
Also , could you suggest me what kind of clothes I should bring , please ?
I am really looking forward this camp .
Anyway , I really enjoyed helpying at a pop concert last month so that I 'd like to write them down !
The interview was OK and my friend and I was hired !
Our heart was bumping and we were kind of nervous , however , there were a lot of things to do so we started working .
After working 30 minute , a singer appeared .
Anyway , by the time we finished everything , thusands of funs came in this concert hall .
Also , we got some posteres as well .
I wish you were there with us !
I 'm writting to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition .
First of all I 'd like to thank you for the prize , I will enjoy it abosolutly .
Your letter encloses an application I have to fill with some information for the travel .
Well , as you demand , I tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins , I 'm going to be able only this summer month because my job responsabilities .
Acording to the choice whether I prefer tends or log cabins , I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping the nearest to nature , if it 's possible in front of a lake or a river , if you camping has one , so that I will be able to practise my favorite and skillful hobby : sailing .
As well as this one I 'll take painting , I 'm very keen on art and I think I 'm good at making portraits .
Finally , I 'd like to add some further questions : what kind of clothes do I have to bring ? , Do I any kind ? , and Would it be necessary to bring money ?
, how much ?
Thank you very much , and I hope the information above would be sufficient .
Your faithfully Jose Fernandez
" Wuthering Heights " by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man .
Besides that , this character is more interesting than others due to his complex mind and his deep evil manners .
It 's the richest character at all , his name is Heathcliff , and he 's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters .
They are always suffering the revenge that Heathcliff swear , cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in .
From this point of view I think Heathcliff should n't be hated by his bad temper .
He 's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but the others character make him become thus .
This revenge links the story so without it we would not have such " Wuthering Heights " .
I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point of every book , film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them .
I would like to travel only in July , because I have only one month holliday this year .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent , because I think is a great fun and a bit more adventurous .
It is not too much confortable , but it is not a problem for me , I like this kind of holliday .
I am keen on photography so I would love to participated at this activity , I am very good at that and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others .
I also will take painting , because I always dream about painting , but I never try to , so I think it is a good occasion .
I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with and how many money , more or less , do you think I should take .
Thank you to ask me my taste and to be preoccupated about it .
Like you know last month , I had helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot .
Firstly I had to make the decor of the scene , so I made in the background a sky with a lot of bright stars .
Then I put some blue lights .
furthermore I made some stars in paper in argent color .
But that was only the begining of my adventure .
The most exiting part was when I had to make up the pop stars !
I never had met pop stars before and I was very impresed , but I was too happy to show my shyness .
It was like a dream who becomes tru .
I ca n't explain how supper it was .
I stayed with him until the concert begun and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers .
Well , I have to leave you now , but I will tell you more details when we next meet each other .
I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday , to see the play " Over The Rainbow " and I must say that I got rather disappointed .
First of all , the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty - five minutes .
Also , your advertisement sign says that discounts are available .
What is quite not true because when I asked for it , the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding " no " .
When the play finally started , and the two actors entered the stage , I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook , differently from what the advertisement sign says , what really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play .
After the disappointing performance the actor who replaced Danny Brook , I went to the theatre restaurant , and , also differing from the advertisement sign , it was closed .
There was only a small sign stamped on the door , saying that it was " closed for repairs " .
So , unfortunately , I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had , and given the reasons , I expect to count with your sense of responsability , so , I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds spent on that terrible night .
yours faithful ,
As we all know , technology had a gigantic improvement over the last 20 years , and today , it affects us in many ways .
First of all , we all became much more sedentary than in the past .
Most of the modern jobs involves computers , so there is no physical effort , just mental , but , on the other hand , we improved communications with computers and Internet , a kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally , to see the other person , just the need to talk .
Also , with today 's machines , factories have significantly increased their production , what brings progress to humanity , but also , with the continous replacement of men by machines , the unemployment is increasing too , and today , it worries every single citizen of the world , specially the ones who lives in third world country .
So , men have invented machines to help him on his tasks , but nowadays , we our becoming slaves of them .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines , so , today 's children must be introduced to computers since an early age , so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future .
After having read your letter , I write to you to inform you that I would like to travel in July .
It is the only month where I do n't work .
As for the accommodations I would prefer a tent , there 's nothing like hearing raindrops on canvas at night !
I have sailed some in my youth but have never went climbing .
It would be a fun experiance !
Will I be needing any money .
Please send me a list of needed clothes and/or supplies .
I would like to know if there is a medical staff present during the two weeks ?
Does any medication have to be declared to them ?
In case of any accidents , will the transport back home be paid for ?
Why can shopping be unenjoyable ?
Some people are boring to shop with , they do n't talk or comment anything they see .
Women , in perticular , have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see .
We all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes ( usually several ) but it 's still better than when we 're talking about shoes !
Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when being bored , but shoes are just shoes .
Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance .
It seems to last forever and just when you think she 's done , she spots an othe pair .
Shopping for me is supposed to be a very fast experiance .
I recently booked a week 's holiday in London to see the musical " over the rainbow " the date was the 9th of June 2000 . from your firm .
It was said that Danny Brook should play the leading part , but there was a different actor instead .
This made me really disappointed .
We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play should start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 then it started .
It was also said that discounts was available but this was wrong , because we could n't get any discounts .
The theatre Restaurant that should be open after the show was closed because the chief was ill and there was no food in the fridge .
I am therefor writing to ask for a full refund
How should she manage to keep quiet about this .
This was the best thing that ever had happend in years for the Fennall family .
Maria was still a little bit chocked over the naus of having a baby .
Which was very chooking for her mother .
One day when they all sat down at the kitchen table for having their lunch Pat said ,
I AM REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PRIZE I'VE WON , I'M WRITING TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED ME FOR AND , IF IT 'S POSSIBLE , TO HAVE SOME FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE CAMP .
I WOULD PREFER TRAVELLING IN JULY , BECAUSE I HAVE MY EXAMS IN JUNE AND I'VE SIGNED FOR A CONTRACT AS A SHOP ASSISTANT STARTING IN AUGUST .
SINCE I HAVE THE CHOICE FOR MY ACCOMODATION , I'LL DEFINETELLY GO FOR THE LOG CABINS , BECAUSE I CAN'T BARE THE HEAT INSIDE THE TENT .
OUT OF THE LIST OF ACTIVITIES GIVEN I'VE CHOSEN GOLF AND PHOTOGRAPHY ; GOLF BECAUSE I LOVE THE SPORT ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET TO PLAY IT MUCH ( I'M NOT BAD AT IT ) , AND PHOTOGRAPHY BECAUSE IT 'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS LOVED TO LEARN BUT I'VE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE .
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IS ABOUT THE WEATHER CONDITIONS , SO I CAN DECIDE ON WHAT CLOTHES TO TAKE , AND ABOUT COSTS , SO I CAN MAKE A BUDJET FOR THE HOLIDAY .
MY JOB MAINLY INVOLVED HELPING TO SET THE STAGE AND TO TAKE IT DOWN AFTER THE CONCERT , BUT I ALSO GAVE A HAND BACKSTAGE WHEN NEEDED .
I WAS PART OF THE STAFF , WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS CARD AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T - SHIRT AND A CAP ( I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU ) ; OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT , AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD , SPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED UNDER THE SUN , FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M. WITH AN HOUR BRAKE FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS THE SAME AFTER THE CONCERT .
AFTER THE STAGE WAS SET , THE REST OF THE THINGS I HAD TO DO WERE QUITE EASY AND ENJOYABLE ; I COULD STAY EITHER BACK OR FRONT STAGE AND GIVE A HAND IF NEEDED , I REALLY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE I LEARNT A LOT OF TECNICAL THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ; AND WHAT I ALSO ENJOYED WAS THE GOOD PAY !
I 'm writting to you to complain about a theatre play I have seen , called : " Over the rainbow " .
This show was for me very disappointing for many reasons : First of all , I was very surprised by the no presence of the famous actor , Danny Brook , who was one of my reasons to book a sit .
Also , I 'm unhappy about the bad informations of your advertisement , which clearly says , the play begins at 19.30 instead of 20.15 as my evening ' show .
At the end of show , unfortunately for me and the others spectators , the worst thing happened : the theatre 's restaurant was closed without any reasons and nobody went to us to apologise or advice us for an other restaurant opened late in the night .
That 's why , in return of all those problems , I 'm asking you to give back some money .
I 'm looking forward to have an answer from you .
That 's why all his friends were angry against him and let him alone .
It was clear that Pat had to change and show to his friend that they can believe in him thrutly .
For those next days , Pat will do his best to be the most sympathic as possible .
To beginning , every morning Pat says a pleasant " hello " in adding to that a big smail .
His mother always says : " If you are smailing and are nice with the people , the poeple would be nice and would smail to you " .
As Pat does always what his mother says his friends began to play again with him , but not just his old friends , every body wanted to play with me .
The morality of the story is here very clear : be nice with the people and the people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend .
Thank you for the information , that I won the competition .
I would preffer travelling in July , I have only these time , because my summer holidays during these days .
To your answer about living in tents or cabins , I would like to sleep in a tent .
A cabin remember me too much to my home and is too confortable , that is n't what I want to have if I live in a wild area .
My favourite sports are climbing and surfing , I 'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practise .
Yes , I have some questions on clothes , what should I take with me and how much money will I need ?
I hope , I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply on my ones .
You ca n't believe what I did last month . I was given the opportunity to build up the concert and of course I took my chance .
First I arrived really early in the morning on the place , but the people were just working and I joined them .
My duty was to montage the spot lights on the right places , but it was n't just easy .
You had always some problems because like not having enough wire or the lamps were broken by the transport .
The experience that I made was , that I had never worked in a such perfect team .
I was able to ask anybody , and he answered detailly , althoug he was full of work .
After the hard work we took cool drinks , sat down on the ground and enjoyed the pop concert .
And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard job we all were a little proud to be here .
I 'm writing you followwing our visitting your theatre last night .
As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper , it said ' Starring : Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ' .
And from your advertisement , the show should start at 19.30 but it did n't .
And also I could n't buy tickets with my credit card but on the advertisement , it said ' discounts available ' I was really annoyed by that !
After the show , we expacted to eat something in your restaurant , but it closed !
And I would like to know if it posible to have the money back .
Thank you very much and I look forward to hear from you .
Yours centainly ,
So one week later all student in my class knew that I was an angle .
Certainly !
Nobody believed her ... neither me .
But it 's true ... I 'm an angle and I wanted to visit the earth .
It 's easy to do but the only one rule was I can tell my secret to only one person .
And if someone elso knows , I wo n't be able to go back to the heaven unless I kill the person who told my secret .
Pat was the only person who I told my secret but now it has become a joke ! I promised to myself ... I would have to kill her !
I started my plan .
We started to go out in the same time as I started to change my mind .
I do n't want to go back to the heaven anymore as long as I am with him .
I am writing to reply for your letter about competition .
Secondly you asked me , when I have time for travel , so I can go only in July , because only in July I have holiday .
And I would like to go in the first part of this month , socond part I spend with my familly .
If you do not mind I would prefer tent , because in tent I will be along .
While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing , because it is my favorite sport .
I am good at it - I am sailing from childhood .
The second activities which I would like to do is surfing - I have never do it .
I would like to know , how much money I must have with me ?
Yours faitfully
In my opininion this book ' The Old Man and the sea ' is the best book which Ernest Hemingway had writen .
Thise book is about men who know that he will die soon , he know that he did n't made his dream coom tru .
So he decidet to go for last trip in his life .
He s destenation is get Marlin .
He is very old , and he is n't so strong that he should be .
He need to rest , but he do n't geve up .
I the end he make his drems coom tru , he get vast Marlin .
In thise book Hemingway is trying to tell us , that if we want something , we can get it , it can be deficult and take long time but we can do it .
We must believe in our selfs .
People in our ages should think about this .
Sometimes they geve up , befor they get something ,
To sum up I must say that every - one should read this book .
I was expecting to have fun , so I decided to go to the play " Over the Rainbow " , that s now presenting in your theatre .
I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a plesent evening .
From the beggining it was all a disappointment .
When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card , but that was not posible .
I let this pass and I bought it anyway , thinking that was posible that it was only a mistake in your advertisement .
But the play started fourty - five minutes late , and the star of the show , of whom I 'm a great fan an who was the mainly reason of why I decided to see the play , was changed for another actor , how turned out to be really bad .
You will understand how upseting all this was , and I decided to visit your restaurant , thinking that could save my visit to the theatre , but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel felling mad an hungry .
I think you realized why I 'm writting this letter to ask you to give my money back .
All the thing that were promised in your advertisement were not true , and it was definitly NOT the perfect evening out .
Specting that you will solve this misunderstanding .
There 's no doubt that modern tecnology has changed our lives , but how ?
I think that some of the changes had been very good , like the impruvement to the medical science , that now can saved millions of persons that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives .
It has changed the ways in how people comunicate .
First the telegraph and the radio an now TV , the telephone and the Internet allowed people be in contact with others really quickly and distances are nt now so difficult of overcome .
But tecnology had not only changed our lives in a good way , giving us thing that can make our lives more confortable , it had also thing that are nt bad , but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world .
The weapons and the factories are destroing our planet and we need to realized that we have to use tecnology to impruve our lives , but always triying to respect nature .
Dear Madam Helen Ryan ,
I have received your letter yesterday .
I really thanks for your organisation has given me the opportunities to go abroad U.S.A.
The date that I would like to travel , that will be nice to go on 1st of July .
Because my summer holidays break is start at end of June .
And I need few days to prepare my stuff .
Regarding to the accommodation , I would prefer to stay in tents more than log carbins because I have a lot of experiences of built up my own tents .
When I was in highschool I used to be a member of the campfire .
The activities that you have listed forms .
Some of the them I really interested in it , especially painting .
Since I was young , my dad he alway took me out to have live drawings , so now it became my hobbies .
And I think , it is nice to draw the beautiful landscapes of the place .
Beside drawings , swimming is my favourite as well .
When I was in highschool , I have joined in the swimming club .
And I also participated in a few swimming competition .
Although I 'm not the best , but I have a lot of confident in it .
At last some of things I need to clarify , that is , what type of clothes and money do I need to prepared .
For most of the people might think , why would I say that , because shopping is a very good entertainment especially for female , as me .
For frank , I like to shopping .
Of course not because of buying things .
I like to have window shopping that is good to go arround the shopping area .
It would help you up to the date .
What fashion is hit now .
But , when during any peak season , like Christmas , holidays or even during weekends .
Then I can say I 'm definatly does n't feel any enjoyable .
Because of the crowd .
For me I think , it is not shopping that is kind of suffering .
Especially , queue up for twenty minutes for just paying the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting your the right size of clothes .
So sometimes I do n't think shopping is enjoyable , and if there is any big festival , I would rather stay at home and watch television .
thank you very much for your letter .
You have had some questions which I would like to answer now :
- Time of travelling : According to the vacations and school holidays in Germany I am only able to travel in July .
- Accomodation : Log cabins would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California .
You now that we are not used to living in such high temperatures in Germany as it will be then in California .
If there are only tents available at this time it will not be a problem for me , too .
- Activities : During my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing .
On the other side I have no experience in surfing , - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation .
- Additional question : Could you tell me how much extra money is usually needed for a two week camping ?
Greetings from Germany !
Before we can give our opinions on this statemant we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing about .
' Shopping ' stands for buying goods for your daily requirements , e.g. food , clothes .
We do not speak here about luxuary goods .
In this contest , shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently .
It is not enjoyable if you look at it as a duty .
But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buy you will go shopping with much more consiousness and joy than before . '
Shopping ' could be annoying if you look at it as a waste of time because you do it every day .
Reorganize your behaviour of shopping and plan to keep food in stock !
Try the internet and use e - business and online - shopping to order your pants for example .
This is even an appropriate way to get around unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time .
Choose your clothes at home after you have ordered them by e - mail !
Another solution to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop .
You have been presented some causes why shopping is not always enjoyable .
There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it .
It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a ' smart ' shopper .
Recently I am interested in musical shows , because I have never seen it in my country .
When I saw your advertisement for the show , it was so attractive for me .
However it started 20:15 !
The worst one was that the actor and actress were not the person who had been written in the advertisement , because of that I was extremely disappointed .
It could be difficult to feel how many things has been changed in our daily life .
But if you thought 10 years before you can easily notice .
I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage view , In an advantage .
The modern technology is developing toward convenience for human .
So , we can be connected other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond to other contry people in real time by using internet .
How incredable it is !
However not only this advantage but also there are lots of disadvantages .
Although mobile phone is very useful our life , it might be harmful for our brain because of micro wave it can cause the cancer or traffic accidents .
In addition the side effect of artificial farm products also ca n't be ignored in our daily life .
So I would like to say the science and techology changed our daily life more convenience it also could be dangerous .
Thank you for your confirming about the first prize in your competition .
I was pleased as I got it .
I hope I 'll be able to travel on July .
I prefer to stay in log cabins , therefore I 'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog .
I love swimming and also I 've got a scubar diving licence .
I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday .
Singing is the most favarite hobby for us .
We often go out to sing in Karaoke bar .
I 'd like to know that how much monery , how many clothes we need .
It would be grateful if you sent me more details
Yours sincerely
First of all we ca n't go shopping without money .
Nowadays , most product 's prices has gone up with our own country 's economy development .
Despite the poor material of product , we have to pay much money , even though we completely satisfied shopping at that time , we sometimes regret buying after the shopping .
It sounds like foolish .
However it often happen .
Secondary the customer 's service often makes us angry .
Of couse , the shopkeepers are human being as well .
But for their considerations , they 're working in their rutines .
I sometimes loose my desire to buy a thing because of their badly behaviers .
Moreover , shopping is just a part of life style .
It 's necessary to buy something to alive .
We have to buy for some thing .
For example , for our jobs supecial ceremonys and so on .
Even when the risk comes up with shopping .
First of all , according to your advertisement , Danny Brook should be one of the stars , instead there was one for me totally unknown actor .
Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there was no discounts what so ever and finally , because of a shortage of staf , your restaurant was not available for us .
This event was not what I call : " a perfect evening out " , as your advertisement promised .
I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities .
It did n't take long time until my embarrassing story was out in the open .
I asked myself how I could be so stupied , telling her my secret after all I been going through to keep it to myself .
But now when the story was out , it was just to start to accept it .
Now I did n't need to go around and worring about it anymore .
At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared in my face .
I decieded to thank Pat , and maybe , if possible , teach her a lession .
I pretended to be totaly miserable .
Pat did n't know what to do , she apoligised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devestated .
After huging eatch other we promised never to tell others about our secrets .
Especially not if it has to do with failing all exams ....
A few days ago I went to the Circle theatre to see a musical show which it shows in your theatre now .
Also it made me very disappoint .
The first one I am going to complaint about is the actor .
There was an different actor instead of him .
Secondly , the times , it 's available 14.30 and 19.30 so I choose 19.30 .
However it was deleied it started 20.15 .
Also I had a student identification card to discount the ticket price but it was unavilable to discount .
The theatre restaurant was closed after the show , they said funds are runn out .
Those are totally unexpectable so I presume that I would like to get paid for my ticket cost .
I ask you to transfor money into this account .
First of all it 's difficult say what exactly modern technology is now but I can say for sure it 's keep developing and much better than the past .
Think about the conputer , the speed of conputer is much faster than before .
I even could n't imagine our p.c can be that fast .
Also T.Vs , I guess that I was not able to watch colour T.V if I was born in 1960 . T.V colour only consist of white and black .
Nowdays the technology is keep develop and the better technology gives us easier life .
Another example , the internet .
This is revolution which has changed our daily life .
You can have a shopping on the internet and it might the fastest way to gather any information you would like to search .
However it also can make our life very lazy .
People who have their car , they do n't attempt to walk on foot even if it is short distance .
The improvement of technology can makes our life easy and in the other way it also can makes our life lazy .
Dear the manage of theatre ,
I really expected the musical show , but it was a disappointing show .
At first , you advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it had different actor disappointely .
Secondly , it said the show started at 19:30 , but it deleyed to 20:15 .
Thirdly , tickets were £ 10 , £ 15 and £ 20 , and I knew that these were available to discount , following the advertisement .
And I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed though they said it was possible to visit theatre restaurant after the show , they did n't prepare at all .
You said it would be perfect evening , but it was n't .
It was upset evening .
So I ask for money back to you . I could n't be satisfied your theatre .
With hopeness you understand me .
Unfortunely , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Pat talks others secrets to everyone easily .
At first when he had a girlfriend , they talked to each other franckly .
His girl friend talked to him everything .
Because she believed him .
But after they seperated , his told his friends her secrets without considering .
And when his friend , J , got big problem , J asked Pat and his friend for help him .
It was about his private problem , related his friendship in whole school .
If he had told everybody , J would have been blamed by whole school .
Actually it was not on his purpose .
But sometimes , Pat mistakes to speak someone 's secrets .
Though it was not on his purpose , it makes his friends leave him .
They ca n't believe him .
Pat also regrets about his speaking .
It is like his one of bad habbits .
Poor Pat , now he is blamed by everyone such as the people who he talked their secrets to everybody .
It was a very unpleasent evening .
First of all , it had read on the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring at this show .
But someone else participated instead of him .
I had read that there would be available some discounts , but I became none of them .
The restaurant should had been oppened when I came out , but it was closed because of the hour the show finished .
I hope you can understand my disappointment and ask for my money back .
In our days , nobody can live without technology .
The timer of my radio wakes me up at half past six .
I stand up , go the kitchen and prepare myself something to eat in the microwave .
After breakfeast I have to use my car to get to school .
Without my car I would always reach late .
I use it to make compositions , to print some pictures or to surf on the internet .
After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends per telephone .
Without these technology I would get realy bored .
Now , I loose less of time and can use the technology to enjoy myself .
I am writing to answer to the questions I have been asked in your previous letter .
I have decided I would like to visit Camp California only in July because I have already organized an other trip for the month of august .
I would rather prefer sleeping in log cabins if its possible because I have back problems and I am not allowed to sleep on the ground .
I have also chosen as activities the ones of Golf and tennis .
I am rather good at these sports because I have practised them since I was a little girl .
Do I have to take with me my tennis raquet and my golf bag ?
I would be very thankful to recieve answers to my questions .
it was really cool .
Boy , He 's really really handsom !
I was in charge of the lights of the stage , you know , all those colourful lights that go all around the stage .
It was hard work because I have been practising for several weeks .
I had to learn what part of the stage had to be lightened with a blue light or a green one .
Even though I ended terribly tired I really enjoyed myself .
It was a strange experience because its something new for me .
yours friend ,
I am writing to your to complain about the musical show called " Over the rainbow "
As a matter of fact , I waited for seeing Danny Brook who I appreciate a lot and I was very disappointed that he was n't here .
Besides , the actor who filled him in was unknown and specially boring .
Secondly , the show had to begin at 19.30 pm , in fact he began at 20.15 pm and that without any explainations !
Your advertisement mentioned that discounts were available , however when I asked for them to the staff they replied to me that they were n't discounts !
After the show , I wanted to visit your restaurant and once again , I was disappointed because it was closed . Anybody could explain to me why !
I hope you would take notice of this complaint seriously .
My daily life changed in some ways when I got the hand of using new technologies .
When I started work , I wrote everything I made on sheets and if sometimes I made mistakes , I had to cross out and it was n't very well - made .
Now , I enter datas and I do n't need any more to calculate my figures , the work is completely made by the computer and in addition there is no mistake .
If I have to find out timetables , it is very useful to have the possibility to see on the Internet , besides , it is the quickest way !
At the beginning , I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I did n't know exactly where I had to look for .
But after a while you gain experience and you get soon used to this kind of research .
Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobil phone .
As a matter of fact , if I am stuck in my car in the traffic , I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I would be late .
Sometimes the ring is annoying but finally , the mobil phone is a great handy object .
The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular stuff for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you .
Eventually , after long seeking you find a skirt you like .
Accident like that can really make you livid .
You phone your friend to visit you and your friend come , wearing the skirt not unlike the one you have just bought .
But that 's the life . You can always go and buy a new one .
With regard to your letter , I would like to thank and congratulate you for making possible such a wonderful event as your competition is .
If it was possible i d prefer to pass the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July .
In August I 'll be working , so that it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during this month .
About the acommodation , out of the two possibilities , I choose sleeping in a tent , because I think that a log cabin is n't as authentic as a tent , at the camp .
My skills in these activities are very different : while in climbing , this will be the first time I climb .
In surfing learning wo n't be a problem because I have been doing it since I was ten years old .
It would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money on what kind of clothes I 'll have to take with me .
Sorry for not having written you in the last month .
You know that I 'm a little bit lazy , but the main reason for not writting you has been the accummulation of exams during this month .
Do you remember that I had to help in a pop concert ?
Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers , did you know I 'm one of them ?
There I got impressed of how a singer can cause such histerism in the teenagers .
During the two hours of concert we had to attend thirty - six people , who became inconscious after being trapped in the first line by the other people .
If you have to help in a concert and you can avoid it .
It 's the best thing you can do in this case .
I 'm writing you replying to your letter asking for some more information about me , to give you all the information you need .
First of all you asked when would I be able to travel .
You ought to know that is possible to me to go there only in July because I 'm going to work the whole August .
Answering the second question I would prefer my accomodation in log cabins .
Providing that you give me the chance to chose two activities I would love to do swimming and singing .
I attend to swimming and singing classes twice a week so I 'm really good at both .
Are we allowed to carry with all the money we wish to ?
Do n't hesitate to contact me for any more question .
Angeles .
Basing my opinion on my experience I 'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping .
There are some points that give me the reason .
First of all , who is your companion ? If you take mum shopping the right day she has been all day doing housework , that will probably end in discussion .
In one hand , there 's you .
You are feeling sick , angry with your boyfriend .
How do you pretend to see in a mirror that anything fits well on you ?
In the other , you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants , no size for you or too high prices .
Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping journeys ?
Sir manager
I 'm very disappointed of this evening .
The first thing was , that it started 45 minutes late .
And when it finaly started , there was n't Danny Brook who plaied .
You should have informed us before that you 've changed the actor .
After the show I wanted to drink somthing in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started to late !
So I ask you sincearly for my money back becaus it was n't a perfect evening out .
I told her that my parents are getting divorsed and that I will move to Chicago with my mother .
We are together in High School in California and this is our last year .
One day , Pat and I were going home , when she asked me , if I will give a party befor I 'll go .
I had to tell her that I do n't have the time to organise anything becaus we , my mother and I , have to get our stuff ready to move .
She was n't very surprised and soon I 've forgotten her question .
The year was getting to the end .
On Monday in our last week Pat asked me if I want to eat supper at her house .
But when we get into the hous ther were all my friends !
We had a great evening becaus Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets !
I have just received your letter telling me I have won the first prize in your competition , and I am glad for it .
I am writting to give the information you asked me and also I would like to required some information about the prize .
First of all I would let you know I could travel only on July because it is the time that I have holidays from my school .
Furthermore I would like to choose for accomodation tents instead of cabins because I think could be more exciting and more contact with the enveiroment .
Also I would like to response for the activities I had to choose from your list : I would prefer painting and photography because for the others sports I am not healthy at the moment , and I consider I used to do painting and photography very good at the school .
Finally I would like to ask if I need a special clothes and Do I need money ?
Please if you require extra information do not hesitate to contact me .
Dear Kim : I am sorry , I haven't written you soon but I still excited for the experience I had helping Will Smith on the freeway the last month .
Anyway now I am going to tell you everything about it .
As you know I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents ' house , but that Sunday I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay - by one excellent car .
It was a Jaguar with Will Smith on it , I stopped and I was going to ask if he needed some help and he said " of course " .
He had a puncture wheel and he did n't know how to repeared then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies , studies , everything .
He was really kind and friendly but really what I really most enjoyed of it , was when he invited me this night for a drink in the most luxury pub I have ever been .
Could you believe my luck ?
All right that 's about all my news , then writte soon and tell me about you .
I am writting to you in order to give you some details you asked me for in your letter .
About my accommodation prefers , I would really like to be in a tent .
Everytime I travel around , I sleep in nice rooms with nice beds ; that is why I think it is a good option to sleep in sleep - bags .
I think it would be funny to play basketball after five years ; and since I go out to the mountains once a month , I do n't think I would have any problem with climbing .
I would like to ask you some questions : Could you tell me what kind of clothes would be addecuate for these two weeks ?
The pop group were all young people ( between 23 - 30 years old ) , and all of them were really nice .
Our main tasks during those three days ( I worked with 10 other young people ) , consisted in carrying music instruments and loudspeakers , checking the lights and microphones , cleaning everything , ...
The job was hard , but from my point of view , it was worthful .
Every five working hours , we had thirty - minutes break to eat something .
The most exhiting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert , and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day .
That was fantactic !
If you have never been there , I enormous recemmend you to go .
Even I played the drums there !
I hope your exams are doing well , and you write me back when you finish them .
During our stay we saw a bright advertisement of your theatre and decided to see this newest and best musical show ( as it was said in you advertisement ) .
Actually .
I must say that our perfect evening was n't out !
In your ad was said that in main roles would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
Instead there was a different actor whose play was disappointing .
The show had to begin at 19.30 , but indeed it started at 20.15 and we had to wait for 45 minutes in a great noise .
Some words about tickets : you ad noticed that discounts were available so we did n't have money with us .
When we came the administration of the theatre said that discounts are not available .
Finally , when we decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show it was closed ( all the staff went home because the show lasted 45 minutes longer ) .
For all these reasons I would like you to give me at least half of my money back .
With hope for a mutual agreement , Mrs. ( ... ) .
It was May , 15 - our english teacher 's birthday .
Marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to make a surprise for her .
Month ago we began to prepare for this day and we all agreed to keep it in a secret .
We have been discussing for a long time what to present her .
There were a lot of proposals from the students : one proposed a vase , another - a good pen ( he said it would be useful for the teacher ) .
But we decided to buy a picture , because she has always told us about art galleries with a great exitement .
We have chosen the best one with a beautiful nature in it .
A day before her birthday we had an English lesson , and after the lesson Pat came up to Marion and told her about our surprise .
Dear the manager
In the advertisement you said " Danny Brook " is the actor but it was n't .
The person that played instead of Denny was not very good .
The show supposted to start at 19.30 pm but it started at 20.15 pm .
When I bought tickets , they did not discount at all .
I asked them about discounts because I saw in the advertisement .
We bought tickets without discount . I do n't know that they discount for somebody else or not .
After the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it closed .
The restaurant should open until the show finish .
It was £ 60 for tickets .
Yours sinecerely
She is one of my friend at school .
Everybody love her .
If you have any problems , she can give you some suggestion .
If you want her to keep it secrets , do not tell her .
She is not keeping secrets .
He wanted Pat to keep it between them but Pat did not keep his promise .
When Tim found out that we knew his problem and tried to help him .
He was n't talk to Pat at all .
She did not know when she can speak or not speak .
We so worry about her in the future .
She has not a lot of friend because of this point .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it
I knew , I would not come this world again , everyone has only one change to do whatever they want
I come from very ruler family .
You had never made on your own decision , you always had to ask your family 's opinion .
I was saving my pocket money to go to the theatre age 15 .
During the this years I had met with Zuhal Olcoy .
I had seen her every morning while I was going to school .
Despite of going to school by bus easier than riding bycyle I had prefered to going to school by bycyle to by bus .
In that way I had been able to see her every morning .
The more seeing her I could , the more ambitious I became .
At last I met wit her .
She had invited me her play to the theatre .
When I went to her play to see , I realy would love to be a actress .
She was the only person who encourage me to be a actress .
I had had a exam for being theatre players without saying my family .
Otherwise my father could kill me and not let me to go to school .
Despite of the preparing the exams , I had been continue to my school regularly .
It was my dream I wish my dady
The reason is that I am a full - time student on Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of semester , which is in June .
Aspecially in the summer when tempereture and humidity are very high .
From the list of all activities I have choosen photography and golf .
Since secondary school I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it .
I have choosen golf because I have never played in this game .
Please , send me any information of what should I take with me .
I know that you 're waiting for any information about a concert .
My friend offered me a job as a member of techical staff on Sting 's concert .
Our job was to prepare the scene .
We 've built it using ready metal and wodden parts .
Then we had to plug all electric instruments , speakers , lights and microphones .
I was working with a specialist who had to connect all lights together to one computer and prepare a colorful show .
It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure of working with professionalists .
Even Mr. Sting came to us to thank for our help .
I wish to see your letter soon
I think International Arts Festival is a great idea .
For me - dances shows were absolutelly wonderful .
I like dancing and I like watching dances shows .
Dancers worn nice clothes , the music was very good .
I prefere them to others .
During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it needs more room .
I like listening to the classical music in the big halls , too .
My boyfriend was exciting about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers .
We had no time to watch all plays and films .
We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably ticket for all evants because we could change our planes during the evant .
I suggest to organize next IAF in the summer .
We 're going to attend IAF any time , as well .
Thank you for an unusual event
There are many things we are n't allowed to do at school . At first - we have to be at time .
Our lessons start at 8 a.m and we are n't allowed to be late .
Fortunately we do n't have to wear the school uniforms .
Most of studenst wear jeans and sweaters .
We have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it .
Our school - bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books , notebooks , atlases and dictionaries all day .
It is what I 'd like to change .
When we have good marks at school they let us to go out ( to the disco or cinema , but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten ) .
We sometimes help in the house but it is n't neccessary .
We are n't allowed to smoke and drink any alcohol .
We are n't allowed to argue with our parents and teachers It is also horrible .
We musn't talk to them but only listen to them .
I 'd like to change it .
Student 's life is hard but sometimes funny .
Dear : Jane Clark
I had been your annual international art festival .
So , I write some of my opionions and suggestions to you .
I hope it 's may help for next year 's festival .
The idea of " International Art Festival " was great .
But I feel the word of " International " was not really suit ; because you just only got six countrie 's stars and artists came .
The other problem was choosing space .
Like the hall of classical concert was too small and crowded .
Next year , you should calulate or examine how many people come before you choose a hall , which I feel very good was plays and films .
And the offer of " weedend ticket " was an excellent idea .
Because the price was cheaper than buy it sperate and more convience .
Look forward for next year 's festival .
Yours Sinicerely ,
One day , a little girls called Sara .
Suddenly , she heart a men voice called her " Sara ...
Then Sara looked down the river .
Because she saw a golden fish was smiling at her and talking to her .
After a few second , Sara felt that golden fish was lovely .
She never seen any fish had that wonderful colour and can talk with her .
Because Sara hasn't got any bother and sister , and her Mon and Dad need work everyday , so she was very lonely .
Therefore , she came river everyday and talk everything to the golden fish .
They were very close friend .
After half year , golden fish suddenly disappear .
She sat and cry on the river .
Then somebody called her name " Sara ...
Sara .. look at me .. I 'm stand on your left hand side .
Sara remembered the was golden fish .
She suddenly become a human , a little boy .
After a few day they got married .
Both together had their wonderful life .
I am writing about International Arts Festival which I went to recently .
I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual .
I think that International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful .
I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that I had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price .
Firstly , there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world .
Secondly , some concerts took a place in really small halls .
I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year 's in next year .
Therefore , there will be more people coming the concerts .
Finally , food shops should be added in this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractive enought to get audiences .
I would be grateful if you could consider my opinion above ,
Yours sencirely ,
How are you doing ? I 've been also considering rules at home with my friends .
However , I can go out wheneve I want , even in the mid - night .
There is a lot of rules at my school .
Firstly , we 're allowed to drive a car to school , which is quite unusual rule in Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home .
Secoundly , boys are not allowed to have long hire .
Girls ca n't make up on at school at all .
I want to at least put lip coluor on .
I 'll be grade if you let me know about your rules at school and at home .
I am writing in response to the letter , which I had yesterday .
I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition , and , I am also pleased to give details , which you would like to know .
I am afraid that I am available to travel only on July .
Because I have to work all year except one month holiday on July .
Secondly , I would be appreciate if I could stay in log cabins at Camp .
I feel that it would be fabulos places with western design .
However , I haven't had any idea about sailing .
Lastly , I would be grateful if I could have following informations .
I would like to know about clothes , which are suitable for activities .
As well as that , I wonder if I have to take some money for extra activities and few more things .
Thank you for time and attention .
Refering to optional lessons , it was recommended that Speaking and listening , Computer and Business English are suitable for filming .
There seems to be a general opinion that sports , art and music activities such as tennis , football , orchestra , painting , photography should be included .
It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school .
I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have visited .
It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures ' variety of the whole world .
However , at this festival there were artists only from six countries .
Whereas an advertisement promised stars from around the world .
Another disadvatage of the festival 's programme was lack of plays and films which are the best to display the modern county 's culture . I suppose .
That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them .
In addition , it was reasonable - priced .
In conclusuon , I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done .
For example , the next year 's one may last not for two days only , but for a week .
So it will be available for greater amount of people .
The programme can be also improved by adding new categories such as folk songs .
Especially young people who are always out of their small budget .
Fortunatelly , there are many ways to earn some money nowadays .
It mean that a job should be part - time .
This job does n't demand much abilities , but a lot of patience though .
In addition to baby - sitting you may also give some lessons to small children such as ( tl ) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language , Eglish for example .
This job requires a lot of energy however .
But if you do n't like children and are not easy - going enough to work as a waiter you may chose a more pieceful job of a typist at home .
So , you can help them and earn quiete enough .
To sum up , there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad - minded person , you will surely find a way to earn money even in Arctic .
I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I would like to travel on July , because it is the summer and the weather is sunny , moreover I am totally free during this month .
For the accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin , because I can not sleep in tent .
I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for speed sensations .
I am good in those two activities , because I go to the sea every weekend .
I would like to now more information about clothes .
I think that weather is very hot and that the nights are not cold , but I do not know if I must take lot of pullovers .
" Shopping is not always enjoyable " is a statement of men in general .
Women like to go to do shopping , but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands .
Moreover , men prefer to do sports , because the shopping loses a lot of time controry to women , because if they have a free time , they will go to do shopping .
I think that child does not like shopping because he often waits , and I prefer to play with these friends .
He goes to do shopping only if he has not clothes .
I am writing to express my enjoyment that I had at the International Arts Festival the next week .
Firstly , I want to say that this festival is really good and I hope it will have every year .
Furthermore , the attractions were beautiful such as shows , exhibitions and concerts .
I liked all the different kind of atmosphere .
Also , for all these attractions , the price was low and it is important for the big family .
However , I was disappointed by the number of that .
It will be great if there were would have more choice the next year .
I would like to give you a suggestion about the space in the concert rooms .
Considering the crowded , it should have more rooms .
Finally , I will be interested in meet artists from everywhere in the world not only Europeen artists .
In conclusion , I had an unforgetable time .
I would like to eat some different kind of foods , if it is possible .
Your sincerely
Thank you very much for your letter , I 'm very happy to receive some news about you .
I 'm going to reply at your question .
In fact , at school we haven't so many rules .
So , we are n't allowed to smoke inside - and eat in the classroom . We have to wash the board when it 's our turn .
I ca n't remember , because now I 'm 19 , then I can do what I want .
I know that I had to ask at my Mum or Dad for going by my friend after the lessons .
They wanted that I did my homework before to play .
Also , I had to come back at home on time , it was very important for my parents .
I want to change nothing , I was happy .
It 's all for now .
I would like to know some informations about the advertisement of the show .
First of all , why the show began at 20:15 , not at 19:30 as indicated in the advertisement . I waited quite one hour to see the show , and what happened with the actor ?
I came to that show only for see him and when the actor appear , it was another one .
Where were the discounts that I should have earned ?
After the show my sun wanted to eat some biscuits and when I see the restaurant closed , I gave up , I told to my sun that we 'll never come back here again .
The restaurant was closed because there was n't electricity you should close the theatre untill the restaurant get appropriate to use .
I was totaly unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if it 's possible .
I thank you for read my letter , I hope you write for me back , and do n't forget my money !
I am writing what I think what kind of clothes will people wear 100 years from now .
As we see the clothes are changing every hour .
People inventing new kinds of clothes and people buying and wearing differents clothes .
In each country , each people wear differents kinds of clothes , like , people in Brazil wear shorts , T - shirts or only without them , in Saudi Arabian they wear strange clothes , if you analyse the point of view who does n't live in Saudi Arabia .
I 'm quite sure that people in all world will be wearing very differents clothes in the future because , especialy women , like to be very elegant and beautiful will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that 's it .
Dear misses Helen Ryan ,
So I would travel on July because I 've got only there free time .
I 've got a lot of work and my boss did n't allowed me to leave my job any other time .
I prefer to stay in a tent because it 's more like a camp .
And so I can I be better in touch with the nature .
I chose painting and photography .
I like painting and I have talent , I could paint all the day .
You can photograph all kind of arts you want .
I would ask you about clothes and money .
Do you pay for all ?
I 'm looking forward hearing news from you .
We people are often depressed or have stress .
What are we doing then ?
That makes often women feel better .
A friend of mine was depressed because her friend leave her .
She phone me and asked me what about going shopping .
I suggest and we went shopping .
In the time we want to go out of a shop a man stopped us and hold a pistol in his hand .
We were scared and so we did all what he told us .
We were lucky that we are in life now .
The police came and took hi to the jail ( police station ) .
You ca n't be carefull because you do n't know what time it will happens .
But you can be carefull when you speak with him or her that will stolen your thinks .
I am writing this as a reply for you request to provide you with some information about my preferencies .
First off all I 'll prefer to travel in July , because it is the only month I have free .
I 'll have to pass several exams in June , in August my family going to visit our relatives in Austria .
I am not so keen about accomotation but would rather stay in tents than cabins .
It is much more fun and you can really enjoy nature and a company of your friends .
I am really enjoying swimming .
We live near the sea shore and swimming is the sport activitie I am really good in .
Far the best swimmer in my school .
I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with the others .
I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more then just good .
What will be better to take with me , what I 'll need at Camp ?
How much money should I take , will it be any guided tours ?
And how many will be in Camp in July ?
Yours faithfully
She will prefer shopping to everything else .
She thinks that it is the most pleasant spending of time , when you going from one shop to another , watching other people , looking at beautiful clothes , getting some fashionable ideas .
Somitimes I feel very sorry for her .
It seems that going shopping is a sense of living .
And it 's so many people like her .
Lots of families planing a day out to go to a shopping center , and it is a normal routine for them - to spent the all day just shopping .
Not so many people thinking about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more .
They forgot how beautiful could be the countryside , and only tourists you can meet in the castles or museums .
People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied .
People are not smiling to each other , not talking to each other at the shops .
They look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy .
In my opinion shopping is just to cover our basic needs .
Shops are not for spending our lifes in them .
Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends going to play something together .
It feels much more better .
You 'll have happy memories and a good mood .
I 'm so happy to received your letter , and I want to tell you the information you need .
I would like the travel start only july if possible , because this is my Hoilday start , at the Camp California I would like my accommodation in tents , because I work in Army and in the camp I usually stay in tent at night , so I will feel more comfortable .
In those activities I would like to choose Swimming and climbing for my activities in Camp , this two activities I usually do in the Army Camp , I know how to climb up on Rachiat outside and help other people to climp up .
Swimming I 'm teach people in Army .
In the Camp do I need any money to bring with and what kind of clothes I have to wear and take ?
To make a daily life video in school , we should concentrat on the most things we do in a school , the most thing we do in a school is haveing lesson , it is a very useful parts of this video and is the main subject .
The lessons we take in the video , should be the main subject we study .
In the video I think we should take part to talk about , what we doing in feel time and study period .
This is another important part of our school life , and we should make a section to talk about lunch and where are the people go to eat their lunch or what they do ?
After we talk about lunch , we should take about activities we are doing and the systems about the activities in school or outside school and make a little section of the School term , and what kind of sport the people like the most .
At the end of the video , we should find one or two studen sit together and ask them a few question of how do they feel to study in the School ? this is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school .
I am writing to tell you about the festival in this time and I would like to suggest you three things for next festival .
First of all , it is great idea to have a this kind of festival .
I supposed to see quite various nationality .
Secondly , I actually liked Jazz , rock and classical concerts very much .
However , some concert halls were too small for the many people so we could n't have a enough space . thirdly .
I would like to you to consider about having more plays and films next year .
Otherwise , the price was really reasonable for all : events the weekend . I was satisfied with that .
It would be greatful .
And I would like to thank you about making this festival .
I look forward to next festival very much .
Only It was like a formal clothes .
And we could n't wear any colorful clothes and socks .
Also our hair style was the same as everyone .
But I ca n't it .
I 'm pursuading my mum , perhaps .
The school rules in my country are more strict than your country .
If you want to know about something of our country . I 'm glad to tell you more .
Loves ,
I am writing to reply your letter saying that I have won the competition , which I ca n't believe .
I would like to have accommodation in log cabins as I find sleeping in tents very uncomfortable thought it may be a new experience .
It would be nice to have a chance to try new sport when we are relaxed .
Besides golf , taking wonderful photographs of sceneries has been my dream , even though I am a beginner .
My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try whole new experience of helping at a pop concert .
The most difficult work was to arrange coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience from countryside .
Do you know what I liked most from this experience ?
I 've found pop music so wonderful , it changed my idea of that classic music is always best .
I am writing in response to your advertisment in Today 's newspaper .
I recently spent two days at the International arts festival and I found it very entertaining .
It was really a good idea to organize a festival containing such different shows .
The idea that I prefered the most was to suggest a reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of student or unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money .
I went to see a classical concert and , although the music played was excellent , he concert hall was too small .
He told me how great it was and I was thinking that it would be a good to have more plays and films next year .
In addition to this , I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in sommer .
Yours sincerly ,
Two sisters , Alex and Daniela were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do .
It was near Christmas and the two girls had n't found any present for their mother .
Offering Christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and only four days left .
Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather .
In deep of herself , Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere , but she did n't want to admit it .
Unfortuneatly , Daniela fainted .
Alex began to cry and to pray and when Daniela was about to die an angle appeared .
He asked Alex if it was more important to bring back a present at home or to save her sister .
The answer was obvious and the angel saved Daniela ..
This story happend a long time ago .
Dear , Helen Ryan
Thank you very much for the prize at camp California in America .
For the time that I would like to travel must be on July only .
This is because my A - levels exams is coming up so I really need times to revise , and July is the only month and time that I am free .
An accommodation , I prefer to stay in a tent .
This is because it is my first time to see an outside world by myself so I need to gather up new experiences .
I have never ever stayed in a tent before but some of the people I know said that it is fun and much more exiting .
As I am a person who is love and doing activities , so I would like to choose to do sailing and photography .
Once I used to take a photography course at my school and my teacher taught me well about taking photo .
Also I tried how to sail before , but I am not perfectly good at it , but I love to sail more .
Finally , I would like to ask about what kind of clothes do I need to bring ? and the money , do I need much of them ?
Please , give me a suggestion about these .
Your faithfully
Dear , Kim
How are you ? I have written to you to tell you about the greatest experience that I ever have .
Last week I offered myself to help the others at the concert and it was amazing .
I could n't believed how close I was to the band .
There were so many youngsters at the concert , but because I was the youngest in a helping team so I guess that I was the luckiest at that moment .
A concert did very well and I enjoyed it so much .
After a break , the bank have to carried on the concert for another one hour and a half .
People at the backstage including me were helping to clean up all the stuff and ready for the end of the concert .
The time has come , when the band finished the concert , we have to served them drinks again and helped to clear up the stage .
Afterwards , I have a chance to took photos with them and have their autographs etc .
It was the enjoyable time in my life and wished that you were there with me .
From this letter , I am sure that you should be able to share this experience with me .
My name is Anne Singler and I have already watched the musical " Over the rainbow " in the Circle Theatre .
In your advert for the musical show you promised the newest and best musical show , but it was n't .
First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a smaller pice than £ 20 for my six year old daughter .
Then the show already started at 20:15 and not at 19:30 !
For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook was n't there .
My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans .
The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook was n't as good as Mr. Brook .
When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill .
After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad remembers of this evening .
So I want to ask you for giving me my money back because I think I have better spent my money on anything else .
After that Paul got white in his face , he was pale like a wall and it seemed as he would be very nervous .
Pat could n't understand Paul 's reaction and so she did n't care about it .
Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally , which just came out of Paul 's house .
Now Pat realized what was going on and could undstand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret .
In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets !
I was impressed of the idea of the festival . I could enjoy different culture and also I could expand my knowledge .
Moreover , the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days the festival - Saturday and Sunday .
The ticket price was not too expensive for student too .
Jazz and classical concerts ' halls were especially small .
Except these two things , it was quite good .
I 'd like to suggest this - concerned with plays and films .
Plays and films qualities were good , but quantities were bad .
Before that you have to think why you need to earn money and how you do that .
I could make a bit of money , of course , it was far much than pocket money .
Nevertheless , I lost my concerntration to the study and I spent the money to entertainment .
Secondly , I made brochure for a company when I was in high school .
I was studying computer at that time .
Also I was leader of the computer user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle .
Despite the fact that it was part - time job , I worked very hard because I liked computer works .
I could earn money , also I got a career .
It was also hard and difficult , but I think that was easy way to make money .
So lose was bigger than profit .
In conclusion , if you want to earn a bit of money , then you have to choose proper part - time job .
If you haven't purpose , you would waste money easily and quickly .
Dear Mrs Jane Clark ,
I am writing with reference to the International Arts Festival I have recently been to and I would like to give you my opinions about it .
According to the title of the advertisement , which was a great idea , there were stars and artists from around the world ; but they were only from six countries .
In addition to this some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there fro the occasion and , personally speaking the show could be done at the open air next year , so that music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around .
Plays and films had a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it .
The other events I went to , dance shows , art exhibitions and talk by writers , were well organised and extremely interesting .
Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably - priced and this was excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people , adults but also students , to take part to the Festival .
I 'm writing to answer your question about rules in my life , at school and at home .
As you may know , I attend a Liceo , which is the most difficult kind of high school in Italy .
Our teachers are very strick , we have to stand up as they come into class and wait until they say ôDo sit down ! , , .
We ca n't talk during lessons and we only have a en minutes break at 10.30 a.m. If we 're late , we have to go to the principal and ask for his signature to go to class .
It 's hard to be extremely quite for five hours but I reckon it 's a good way of education .
On the other side , I feel free at home . I help doing cleaning or the washing , but I do it because I want to , not because my parents make me do it .
I can go out and stay out late , I 've got my car and my mobile , so that they can call me whenever they need to hear me ; but above all I know they trust me and consider my an adult .
Therefor I would n't change anything in my home life and neither in my school life .
Best wishes .
Dear Mrs Ryan
I would like to travel in July because I have got summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August .
I think a tent would suit my personal life - style better than a log cabin because I love the nature .
I have been playing basketball for 8 years and today I am a member of an Austrian basketball - team .
But I have never played golf in my life but with your help I would be able to learn how to play golf and I think this could be very interesting .
I also would like to know how much money I will get from you for those two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes .
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and I think you want to hear some funny stories about the experience I made .
O.K. I am just kiding .
I do n't like the songs of Brunner and Brunner because this kind of music is very boring .
I also had to clean the washing rooms .
I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert .
But after this serville work I met Eminem .
I had to bring him something to eat .
It was a hard but also a funny work . You should try to called some experience during such a concert you would not regret it .
I have just read your letter and it would be grateful if you could give me more information about the two weeks at camp California in the USA .
I am a nineteen year old gild who is still attending classes at Saint John 's School .
For the past four years I have been playing tennis and I have also done some courses about painting .
I would appreciate if I could travel on July because my school gives me two winter holiday 's week .
As far as accommodation is concern , I prefer staying in a long cabin .
I believe it is better than a tent because this one would not shelter enough .
As regarding painting , I know a lot since my grandmother taugh me when I was five years old .
It would be very kind of you to let me know about the clothes you think it would be necessary for me to take and how much money I will need .
I 'm sorry I haven't written to you before but I have been very busy helping at Mano ' 's concert .
Do you remember when I told you that my dream was helping Mano ' 's group ?
Well , my dream come true .
All started when I was in Drama Club and my singing teacher told me that Mano ' 's group were going to have a concert here , in Argentina .
She also told me that she have some conections with the people in charge of the lights of the concert .
You know that last year I organise the lights in our performance .
So , there I was , controling the illumination in Mano 's concert ! ! ! !
This really help me for our next performance in the Drama Club .
It was so exciting to see the Mano ' group singer that I felt as if I were in heaven ! !
Please write me as soon as you can .
I am writing to thank for the letter with the result of the competition and also to ask some questions .
Firstly , I would like to inform that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another month .
The reason for it , is that , July is the only month in which , I am on holidays so I will not have to miss any classes .
Next , I would prefer stay in tents rather than stay in log cabins because I appreciate having straight contact with nature .
Therefore , I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which I am good at .
I can say I am good at swimming , because in the club I used to be the first in all the competitions and climbing I used to climb trees , walls everything in my childhood without falling .
Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money would be adviseable to take and what kind of clothe I should take .
I look forward an answer from you .
I am just writing to tell you about my experience about helping at a pop concert .
Starting with good points , I could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars .
Moreover , you have the unique opportunity to take pictures with them , to have their names written , on your notebook by themselves .
Despite of being tiring , it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true I experienced that .
Another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money .
Do n't worry because you do n't pay your ticket it is " free " .
From my point of view , there were not disadvantages .
Kim , summing up it was the most interesting experience that I have ever had .
I am glad to hear from you recently and I really appreciate your invitation to California .
To start with I would rather stay in a log cabin because two weeks might be too long to stay in a tent and a log cabin would be more convenient for me .
So I am quite confident with this .
Although I had a few experiences of climbing , my everyday training at gym would retrieve my concerning .
In addition to these reasons , both activities are popular especially in California .
Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy surveniers because this will be first time for me to visit Carifolnia .
Finaly , I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work .
However some people might be opposed to this general understanding because they believe that they can find shopping enjoyable .
Those who love shopping are usually suffer from serious stress and may seek out satisfaction by shopping .
However , things which you can get by money necessarily fill your unsatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more , your emptiness might be bigger .
And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your pertners .
In addition to these , everyone has regretted buying unnecessary things and those things would remind you how silly decision you had done at the moment .
On the whole , shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you migh be extravacant , lose your friends and have what you do n't need .
I 'm writing you because I had been asked to make a little suggestion about the programme your have organised to our English class travel .
First of all , thank you for the programme , we think it is very good , especially the river trip to greenwich , we believe we will enjoy a lot going to greenwich .
Moreover , in our opinion , this travel is going to be very interesting for us .
On the other hand , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we would all like to go the show .
We think it is a good opportunity because london fashion is the most important over the world , and we all learn a lot about London style going to this show .
We think we could change shooping for going to the show .
It is open from 10.00 until 19.00 , and we could go there on the afternoon .
Thinking about the media 's treatment of famous people , I 've realised of some things .
On my point of view the media 's treatment of famous people is very bad .
The media 's are looking forward to create great expectations about famous people .
On the other hand , if the media 's are acting in that way is because of the society .
The society is who increases the audience of the media , if nobody gave attention to the famous people private lifes , this treatment would finish .
But in my opinion , before you get famous you know which are the consequences .
To sum up , there is no job perfect , and be famous involves a lof money , but also a lot of jouralists following your private life .
I am writing you this letter to complain about you have organized us for our trip to London .
I find it really good , specially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery .
But I would like you to know that on Tuesday March 14th in London , there is a show , which is free for students , about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles called The London Fashion and Leisure Show .
All the clan would enjoy going the show , because it is a great oportunity to see an exhibition as the latest fashions .
But we would like to suggest you to move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon , so that , we can go to the show on Tuesday , which lasts from 10 am to 7 pm .
Thank you very much for considering our petition .
Nowadays , in our society , there are some people who , because of their work or because of their success in life , has become popular , and by now is known by everybody .
But , how does fame affect to their lifestyle ?
Politicians , musicians or film starts are controlled all the time , since they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening , by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do .
They usually appear on TV , go to shows , sports competitions ...
And believe me , there is no money in the world to pay that .
But obviously , if these people are all the time in the newspaper , on TV and so on , is because , although we do n't want to accept it , we love following their lifes .
So now , all we should have to ask ourselves is if their damaged lifestyles is in part our fault .
Dear Ms clark :
I am writing to give suggestion for the international art festival , which I have been to one weeks before .
Firstly , I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival , it is very interesting , especially for the young people .
I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time very much .
It was said that stars and artists from around the world on the advertisement , but in fact they are from only six different countries , so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year .
Although the jazz , rock and classical music was great , some concerts and halls are too small , could you consider making them bigger next year .
The plays and films were really wonderful , people liked them very much , so could you play more next year
It was excellent about one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events , because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money , so I hope next year the ticket will be also like this .
I 'm really sorry I did n't write you back immediately , because I was preparing my exam at that moment , so can you forgive me ?
In school , we have lots of rules , especially in the class and some of them are quite strange .
For example , we ca n't go to the toliet during the lessons , we should go there in the brake .
It 's too strickt , I do n't like it .
If I can , I would like to change this , because I do n't think everyone can success at once , we should give them second chance to try .
For me , I do n't have rules at home , just do n't take trouble to my family , that 's all .
OK , just here .
All the best wishes and good luck .
Thank you a lot for your letter , I am very happy of having won the competition .
I have several precisions to tell you and some questions about the camp .
I have exams in June and a work in August .
Then , about accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I am used to .
I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation , I find it more friendly than a log cabin .
I have chosen between the activities proposed to do photography , I have already been part of a photography club so I am experienced .
I also would like to practice climbing but I have never done it before .
Finally , I would like to know what sort of clothes do advise me to bring to be at ease during my activities and as nearly everything is already paid , do I need to take a lot of money with me ?
Thank you a lot for all these details .
First , I had to spend all the day before the concert in the field where it took place , I had to prepare a little the stage but as I was not a profesional , I did not do much with the instruments .
I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood .
I prepared sandwiches for all the staff during the major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the viewers all the evening .
As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to look at the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group .
My name is Sandre Atos , I am writting to you because this last weekend I went to the theatre , you manage , to see what was called " London 's newest and best musical show " .
First of all , Danny Brook , an excellent actor , who ( according to the play advertisement ) was supposed to perform , was replaced for a disappointing actor .
Besides the spectacle was setted up to 19:30 , but ended up starting at 20:15 .
In addition to all this , the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered .
Sir , I could n't believe in that , everything that was in the advertisement was a fraud .
That 's why I am writting to ask for some money back , I believe I have this right .
Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing could ever happened in their lives .
However , since I was a child I have noticed that except for the medical facilities and achievements , it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages . I still remember the day television came to my house , I was only seven , everybody was exciting about the new " toy "
, however what seemed to be only one more way to get together , turned to rule our lives .
Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us .
Before TV , we used to spend our nights , playing cards , telling jokes , talking to each other .
On the other hand , due to science development , I am getting better , recovering from ahsma .
In addition to this it is wonderful not have to wait too long to eat , thanks for the microwaves invention .
Despite all these advantages , I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological facilities , but a very happy and united family .
I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival recently and I am writing in order to give my opinions about it .
When I knew it was going to be an international festival , I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world , but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true .
Besides this , I think that some of the concert halls were too small that I felt very uncomfortable .
However , the one - reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money .
Although that Festival was not well - organized , I would like you to repeat it next year .
I wish you could perform more plays and films , and there should be more varied art exhibitions .
But I really appreciate it if you would take into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls .
I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions .
It is really nice to hearing from you and I think we will learn so many interesting facts from each other .
As far as I can remember , I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important concerning wearing the suitable clothes , to arrive in time and get on with every teacher and authority .
As a consequence , most mates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them .
At home it is the other way about .
I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want , such as inviting friends , watching TV until midnight and so on .
In fact , the only strong rule is to cooperate with house - keeping and meal .
Hope you enjoy my experiences
I had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday .
I had everythig planned , I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous .
Firstly there was no available discount , as you said on your advertisement so even my 6 year old son was charged adult price .
Then everything was going well untill the show did n't start !
Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it did n't , it started 45 minutes late , at exactly 20:15 .
And By the way may I ask you how up to date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert saying the staring actor was Danny Brook , well it was n't .
It was an other actor I had never heard of .
That was a dissapointment for my whole family , infact all the viewers where very dissappointed .
Anyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be , I did n't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress .
So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes desparately searching for your restaurants our stomaches rumbling for food .
The location is far too far away and , what do you know , the place is closed for restoration , and it has been for two weeks !
And your booking staff did n't know this obviously as they took our booking , with no problems whatsoever .
they even gave us a table number .
What kind of an organasation do you call this , sir / madam ?
You do n't understand how dissappointed and angry I was that night .
Thankyou for your time and attention
Yours Sincerely .
In fact he was one of the main busybodies of his neighborhood and his school so not alot of people in his school liked him .
this was a vary bad thing about Pat 's school and also for Pat .
Another bad thing about this school was that there where different types of students that formed groups .
Some where just friend groups but others took it seriously , maby just a bit too seriously , they gave themselves names and acted as gangs rather than just groups of friends , and started picking on younger people , or mempers of other gang , trying to start fights with them .
This whent on and on , got more and more serious but it was so secret that teachers did n't notice .
One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat was n't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictly to keep it a secret especially from the other groups .
But Pat was so exited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates . and the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party .
Everyone in the year was anoyed , but not with Pat , oh , no !
No one could do anything about it .
exept a few phcyco groups , some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party , just for the fun and meannes of it .
Everyone was enjoying themselves exept Pat who had heard about the raid .
But no excuses where working .
he new the attack was coming anyminute .
now ,
The time had come the who groups had comdined their forces and where ready to strike .
they started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew their balloon as far as they could .
they all exploded with loud splashes .
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting every one wit BB guns .
Lots of People wher injured and even more where suspended the next day at school , when the Headmaster found out what had happened .
Pat recieved no punishment at all and he was n't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends .
But he felt awfull because he new that all this had happened because of him .
I congratulated with you because it has been a great idea since the town needed a cultural event .
I especially appreciate the weekend tickets which almost everybody could afford , also students like me .
Being very fond of films , I would have appreciate seeing more of them .
For next year 's edition , you could possibly add some foreign films , like the Chinese ones , which I most like .
Finally , in order to make a really international festival , I think you should invite artists from all over the world , not just from six countries like this year .
Are you young and full of life but you do n't have enough money to enjoy your spare time ?
Simply let your brain work and you could find out wonderful ideas to earn money enjoying yourself .
Are you fed up of looking after the screaming baby of your mother 's friend ?
Are you keen on music and you love going to disco ?
With a short training you 'll be able to mix songs at parties .
You wo n't dance but the earning is guarantee !
Do you like do - it - yourself and your house is full of marvellous but unuseful things ? You could sell them to a specialised shop and finally tidy up your room !
So , what are waiting for ?
Work out your own idea and realise it : money wo n't be a problem for you anymore !
I am writing to response to the international Arsts Festival , which took place on 21 - 22 November .
I would like to inform you , that it was a great idea and valuable activitie as a social event .
However , it was a dissapointment , when I realised that not many countries were attending to the event . I could be fine if I had seen more countries from all around the world , for instance : far east , indonesia etc .
It was n't complicated to find the right hall to the shows , I should say it was very well organised .
But one thing , I have to mention is that some of the concert halls was too small and it was n't comfortable as well as to fell the great atmosphere .
On the other side , I enjoyed to being on of the people to see the plays and films , dance shows which was brillantly performed - art exbitions .
Listening talks by the famous writers was a opportunity which I could n't missed .
I would like to ask , if you could expend the plays and films more for next year ?
I have to add that the weekend ticket was a ideal idea to sell all the events .
Finally , I preciate your organisation and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival .
Its really nice to hearing from you and thank you very much for the letter with photos .
Its a good idea to send them to me , because I have to confess that I have lost my camera and also the films .
What a pitty !
By the way how is your new school ?
Did you like it more than the previous one ?
I must say that our school rules are quite different than yours .
First of all we have to stand up , when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons .
If you missed a lesson , that could be a trouble for yourself . I think it depends on the school .
Privat schools have more relaxed atmosphere that the state school .
They do n't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons .
On the other hand , in the state schools as I said , we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished .
For example , you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc .
Of course smoking is n't allowed at any part of the schol .
I have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks .
My Father does the cooking , my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up !
But in many Families women are doing more than men . I ca n't accept that , because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together .
Anyway it think that 's it for now .
I hope to hearing from you soon .
Lots of Love
As you mentioned that I have won the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. therefore here is the information that you require .
I can travel only in July because during this month I am free to go anywhere , actually it is my summer holiday .
Apart from that I would n't mind at all whether to stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I 'd prefer to stay in tents because it gives me a nice feeling and relaxation , it is very unusal for me to stay in log cabins while you are camping .
The activities that I 'd like to do : First one it would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well due to I used to be a basketball player in my high school .
Second activity it would be tennis , I am not the expert in this one because I 've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like ; serve the ball , back hand and fore hand to hit the ball .
Finally I have something to ask you about how many people can stay in one tents ?
Do I have to bring swimming suit if I want to swim in the camp ?
How much money do I need and what else do I need to pay ?
This information should enough for you but if you 'd like to know more about anything please ask me and do not hesitate .
I 'm looking forward to it and I hope seeing you during this summer .
Your sincerely ,
Sometime when you ask your friend especially girls .
What would you like to after the class or during the weekend ?
The typical answer would be ' I 'm going to shop because I like it even windows shopping would be fine ' .
First of all , it 's wasting my time especially when I ca n't find the thing I want , this is very frustrating .
Apart from that , it 's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one , if possible .
Once you 've got all your shopping list , you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought which is very heavy sometime .
However shopping is not a bad thing , only if you plan it carefully what to buy , where to go , how much money you will spend on ?
Dear the competition organiser ( Helen Ryan )
I 'm as happy to heard that I have won the first prize .
Because I 'm in the holiday that moment .
I think I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California is in tents .
Because it is more safety , and I do n't like to be in the log cabins .
The activities are quite hard to choose really , because you have a lot of chose which is I like .
Photography is a very interesting activitie , and is not too hard to do too .
Here have some questions which I would like to ask , what kind of clothes sould I need ?
How much did I need for the Camp ?
Finally I hope the information I 've gave are useful for you , and hope you can answers my questions A.S.A.P.
Shopping , for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want .
For some people it may be a method to relax themselves , after you have been to work or school .
So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time , but still have something you will not enjoy it .
It depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping .
For example some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life , they wo n't enjoy this kind of shopping , because it is not getting what they want .
The place where you are shopping also very important .
For example in HK all the areas have lots of people it wo n't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping .
Because have too many people it make you want to stay home wo n't enjoy shopping .
After I 've written this composition , I think that you will enjoy shopping most of the time , but still have sometimes you wo n't .
I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I have seen last Sunday at the evening .
Firstly , I become very disappointed because of the actor , who was different from your advertisement , not Danny Brook was starring .
Secondly , I was ready at 19:30 time , as you have announced , and I had to stay waiting in front of the theatre until 20:15 , when finally the show began .
Besides of all , at the end of the Musical , I went to the your Theatre Restaurant , in order of taking a dinner , because I have leaft home without eating and so I was hungry at that time .
Thus , you cann't believe what was my disappointment when I noted that it was closed , without no explanation .
Finally , I would like to say you that I am asking for money back , because I had an evening totally despleased , completely different that you have anouced in your advertisement .
First of all , modern technology have changed my daily life the last five years more quickly than in the anchient time , or even than a ten years ago .
I became to notice the difference in my work , since when all tasks have changed to the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine .
In addition , at the University teachers not accepted more written tasks done by hand , but only they should be written by computer .
Besides , teachers began asking us a lot of article to be copied throught the internet .
From that time , I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge . Firstly I become to write letters and articles , next I learned several computers plays .
When I learned how to use internet , I did n't stop until now .
Nowadays , I cann't stay one day without consulting computers communications throught e - mail or internet . I change corespondecies with all my family by internet , my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and so with a brother who live in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand .
On balance , I can affirm that I could n't without this modern technology today .
My life would n't be the same another time without these progress .
I 'm an italian boy who went to the International Arts Festival last November and I enjoyed most of the events I went to but given that I think that the Festival could be better next year I write you these lines in order to make you know some observations of mine about the festival .
The Festival on its own is a great idea because there are n't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from six counties they could be invited really from all the world .
Furthermore , and for sure it is not your fault , some of the halls for the concerts were too small and that prevented me from enjoying some of the concerts because of the noise but also prevented many people from entering the hall that was often two crowded .
I hope next year plays and films will be more and that the ticket will be reasonably - priced as this year in way that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival .
Friendly
I 'm going to write you about rules in my country and I have to tell you that life in school is n't too hard because even if there are many rules to follow nobody does it .
It 's written in the regulament that we ca n't leave the school during the breaks ; we ca n't smoke near the classrooms ; we had to justify our absences or late - enterings and even if you 're over eighteen your parents have to justify you with the teacher .
Even if my parents do n't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying you do n't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I ca n't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends for a Saturday night party .
These are the things that I 'd like to chance ; I 'd like to do what I really want but I do n't know if I 'm really ready for this ! !
I am writing as a reply to your letter , congratulating me to the winning of the first prize in your competition and inviting me to the Camp California in the U.S.A. I was delighted to hear from you and am already looking forward to spend two weeks in California .
As an accomodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to the nature while camping a lot .
I am looking forward to your reply at your earliest convenience and to get to know you personally in July .
Yours faithfully ,
thanks a lot for your long letter !
You asked me , how the pop concert was like which I told you I was going to go to in my last letter .
My job was it , to help to keep all the little kids out of the backstage area .
Yes , that was the best thing about the concert but I actually just enjoyed the whole experience to be part of the crew .
I sort of felt , like I had done my part to make the concert a sucess .
Do you know , what I mean ?
Anyway , I 've got to study now , we 've got a maths exam tomorrow .
I am writing to you first of all to thank you about the good programme that you give us about the trip in London , especially for planning to visit the science museum , which we believe is going to be very interesting .
However , we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest to including this point in the programme .
The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we fained it very interesting , because we will have the opportunity to see mews , firstly about the latest fashions , secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make up and hairstyles .
In addition of this , it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us , because for the students it is completely free .
We were thinking that meaby we can go early to visit the Science Museum and than go to the Central Exhibition , where the event is going to have place !
Thank you very mutch !
Your sincerely ,
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people .
Of course I must agree with the opinion of my class - mates : famous people , such as actors , singers or politicians , deserve to have a private life , but of course it is not always like this !
Almost the time they have journalists following them everywhere and all the time , looking for great news or interesting pictures to put on the first page of the newspaper , and I do n't think this is very nice , but is the price that famous people have to pay , just becouse they are popular .
Anyway , this is not always necessary a problem , but it can be a big thing for the famous person , becouse let people talking about him and increase his popularity .
In conclusion , I can say that this is not the bigger problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse I am not famous !
I am representative of our class in your college to write to you .
We are very grateful for what you have well - organised the programme going to London for us .
It is a good programme , especially National Art Gallery is one of the most places we would like to visit .
In fact , some of our classmates have seen an advertisement for the ' London Fashion and Leisure Show ' .
Concidently the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14 which is during the period we are in London for the three - day programme .
Of course , leisure as well .
It would be very much appreciated if you could arrange the programme to be changed .
We look forward to hearing a good news from you soon .
We know it does not matter they are famous or not , everyone has his own privacy .
Due to commercial value , journalists have to follow them all the time to peep their private lives to satisfy us .
There , it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them .
However , journalists should not only think about commercial value , but morality and priciples are also being concerned .
Of course , it everyone pays less attention or interest , the situations should be better .
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples .
Although we can not deny it is our nature - curious , we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them .
Actually , I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and Royal family have more privacy . Lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives .
Basle , 12th Decembre 2000
We 'd like to thank you for organising good programme , especially the shopping tour on Tuesday .
Our class is especially interested in latest fashion and trends .
London is a good place for discovering it .
It 's an exhibition of fashions , sport wears , make up and hairstyles .
We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who like to study fashions after leaving this school .
And everyone of us is interested in fashions and clothes !
This exhibition is situated in Central Exhibition Hall , London .
We 've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday , 14th of March .
We 'd like to do our shopping tour on next following day ( Wednesday afternoon ) instead of Tuesday afternoon .
We hope to hearing from you soon .
Basle , 12th Decembre 2000
In your letter , you asked me wheter the book I 've read would be a suitable present for your cousin 's fifteenth birthday .
I 've read all the books of English author Ernest Hemingway .
But I think your cousin is too young for it .
Because he especially concentrates on history , social life and politic situation in the time the story is played .
That might be quiet complicated to understand , especially for young people .
She especially write books for young people .
You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic , detectives and sport , did n't you ? I think this is the best choice for him !
I 've send you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book .
I hope to hearing from you soon !
I 'd like thank you to take us on a trip to London and have made such a good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich .
It also will be " The London fashion and leisure show " on the 14th of March , which consist on an exhibition of the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
Indeed it will be free for us as we are students .
As you know we are in England to learn your language and also your lifestyle , and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this way of your country !
May I suggest an alternative ? We could go to science museum on wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery .
We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning , but that would leave us go to show on tuesday , because we can use the wednesday 's free time to do our shopping .
I hope that my idea sweet you and you 'll agree .
Thank you for your letter , like usual , it 's a pleisure to receive a word from you .
I understood that you 're looking for your cousin 's birthday present , and you 'd like give to him a book , which , I think , it 's a good idea .
It 's a fantastique book , which I recommend to everybody keen on lovestories .
It 's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties .
I recone that it 's quite not an easy reading , but as you described your cousin , I think she really will enjoy it , she 's such good in litteracy , that it wo n't be a problem for her .
I really think you should choose this one for her , it does go with her personnality .
It 'll be a good point for her general culture , Wuthering Heights it 's a classic , which everybody knows about it , even if they did n't have read it , they , at liest , know the story .
Love from ,
I am writing you to complain about , , Over the Rainbow " musical show which took a place in The Circle Theatre several weeks ago .
First of all , advertisement for the shows provided absolutely WRONG information about actors .
Danny BROOK , who should play according your advertisement was replaced by an another actor and it disappointed me .
The show should start at 19.30 , however , the audience have been waiting for fourty five minutes .
Also , in the advertisement you have mentioned discounts which were not provided .
The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I had not recieved the explanations why .
Based on everything listed above , I would like to recieve £ 10 , which I have paid , back .
The ticket for the show is included .
How has morden technology changed my life .
New technologies have become the part of our lives .
There are a lot of arguments about the weather this influence is negative or positive .
Personally , I consider modern technologies as a positive innovation .
Using microwave oven or vacuum cleaner saves me a lot of time .
Computer is extrrmely convenient in writing reports and essays .
And , of course , I can not forget about cars and planes that deliver us to all parts of the Earth .
However , many people , insist that new technologies affect people in a negative way . I would better prefer seeing my father talking to his family instead of staring at blue screen of TV .
But also , I would not be able to imagine my life without the nice way of reciving news with help of it .
Counting pros and cons , I tend to think that there are more positive points in working out and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway .
Modern girl or boy already would not be able to imagine life without them .
I would be very greatful if you could let us to go the show .
I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw its advertisement yesterday .
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
It starts at 10.00 am and finishes 19.00 pm .
The date of the show is on Tuesday 14th of March .
It is really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London .
I 've heard that Leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles are really wonderful .
We all know that you organised everything .
Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you know . We have free timer on Wednesday 15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday .
We can also do shopping quickly after sightseeing of London .
I would be very pleased if you let us to go to the show .
I also would like to say thank you for organising the good program for us .
A DAY OF MY LIFE
I was afraid of doing it but I had to do it .
I promised her to find a money for her operation .
That time , I could n't imagine how my life would change .
When I arrived the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank .
I asked cashier to give me all money .
Before I took money one of the cashier had pressed a button to call a police .
I quickly left bank .
However , it did n't take long that they caught me soon .
The policeman arrested me and I stayed in a prison for 15 years .
The worst thing was my friend died after 10 days I was arrested .
First of all , I appreciate you well - organised programme , especially , " River Trip to Greenwich " which we requested .
It would be the most excising activity in this trip .
However , I saw the advertisement of " THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW " in the newspaper today , and told all classmates about it .
We are very interested in going this show .
So I would like to suggest you to change the part of programme for visiting this show .
This show is held in Central Exhibition Hall , London on Tue .
14 , March , and open from 10:00 to 19:00 .
We can see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up , and hairstyles which we will learn next term .
Therefore , I think it is great idea to visit the show for our knowledgement .
Furthermore , the addmission is free for students .
Unfortunately , our programm is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme .
For example , " shopping on 14 , March ' can be changed to 15 , March instead of " Free time " .
So we will be able to use the time at the afternoon on 14 , March for visiting the show .
I hope that you would give us an opportunity to visit the show .
Some people said that famous people such as politicians , and film stars , needs to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Firstly , most people might remember the sad story of " Princess Diana " she died in Paris few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called " Paparach " .
If she was not followed by journalists , she would n't die .
So , this fact shows obviously that famous people without private life could be the victim .
But on the other hand , ordinary people , including me , are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion .
Moreover , people are interested in their life style .
However , secondly , famous people are not " ailen " so that they might do something , for example , ashame things in public space or argument with partner or family even put on swimming costume like us .
So they can be just ordinaly people like us .
We have to think about this way .
Overall , people should think if we were famous people ... and then we can find the answer that all people , including famous people , need private life and would like to behave in ordinaly life .
Additionally , some concert halls were too small to relax , while most of them were very comfortable .
I suggest to you that you should organise more next year .
On the other hand , there were a lot that impressed me very much .
For example , there was one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events .
Last but not last , I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year .
Long long ago , there lived in a province of Bizen in Japan an old woman and an old man .
They were eagar to have a child , but they had never been able to .
She brought it to her house , cutting it with her husband .
The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much money and many treasures .
Having eaten the kibidango , he departed for Onigashima with three friends of him : a dog , a monkey and a bird .
They finally succeeded n defeating the devils , and took back all the money and treasures .
All the people in Bizen including his stepparents met Momotaro and his friends with a great joy .
Dear Madame ,
I have received your good news and I 'm very happy because I have always wished go to California and now it 's real , so , thank you very much about that .
First at all , I would like to give you some further information from me and secondly , I 'll ask you for some doubts that I have .
About , when I would like to travel I think that my answer will be easy for you , because , I have two months off those are July and August so , my travel should be in between , my accomodation I would like to stay in tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru , long time ago , it was wonderful .
With regard to the activities at the Camp , I would like to choose basketball and photography , because I think that basketball is very complete sport for training your muscles and I used to play in a league in my country , it 's hard but at the same time lovely .
The other selection has been done because I like to much discover different places and with a camera is possible to do it easily .
If it possible for you to help me in some doubts I have , I 'll be really greatful .
One is with regard to how much additional money you believe will be enough to enjoy the holiday ?
Another thing is if the meals are include or I have to paid for them ?
Your faitfull .
Besides , she told me that you are very keen to know how was my experience , so I 'll give you some information in this letter that I 'm sure you will be glad , even you have not been in the concert .
First at all , I 'll tell you that in the day concert I woke up at 6:30 A.M , very early for me , you know me I 'm lazzy , the work began around 8:30 , was very hard but when the band come for training , since this moment I was enjoining to work until the concert had finished , the atmosphere was wonderful , the musicians were very kind with every one who was working because they understood that a concert is a job to be done by a team .
During the concert I listened the band like everybody , besides I earned money so , was a wonderful experience .
Looking forward to hear from you .
You Sincerely .
I think International Arts Festival is a great idea , because you can see how other country 's art is , but I think in this festival , there were too many country 's people .
You should pick only six countries , so it wo n't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small that the people ca n't even dance in classical concerts .
What do you think about picking five people and give them tickets for ' Art Travel ' ?
Generally it was very good and I wish more people would come next year .
Dear Tim , I 'm glad to have your letter back soon .
First , In school , we are not allowed to run .
You have to do your homework and do your best what you 're asked to do .
You ca n't go to the toilet during the class , because you are interrupting the other student 's study and there are more .. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you ca n't say anything while the teacher speaks .
Some family have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday .
Your best wishes from
Thank you for being organised the programme for our class , I think you may think about a long time that how shall we study during three days .
We have seen your programme , and like all of those , especially the Science Museum , it will good for us to increase our knowledge , and so on .
Secondly , I wonder if you know it will have " London fashion and Leisure " be showed on Tuesday in Central Exhibition Hall .
In other words , what they will introduce , is most interested in us , I mean it 's conflict with your plan , what a pity !
All of us want to go to the show , the generation who are the same ago with us all like make up , become beautiful , and it 's important that it will free for students and just be showed one day .
So , we do n't want lose this chance .
Finally , we would like to get your permition to go , maybe if it is possible that you change your programme , we may be going to your college any time after Tuesday .
We 're sorry to give you trouble .
This story happed two years ago .
That was a very hot summer , every people in our city like to swim in the river , perhaps they did n't think it was interesting if they swimed in the pool .
Not only I was a member of swimming team in our school , but also I was tought by my father since I was five years old ,
So I would understood some skills and how to protect yourself from my Dad , if you had a accident .
One day , I passed by a river in accident , I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river .
Suddenly , I heard of " help , help " in my distance .
In a while , lots of passed - by crowed to the river - side .
To my surprise , nobody want to save that boy who was shouting , just stood there , like lots of " champ " .
I started think about it , after all , either had I neve done this task before , or trained .
I just 15 years old .
Finally , I jumped into the river , I really knew that was dangerous , but I haven't think about anything except " justify " this word .
I also extremely hated those people who stood there all the time .
Thank goodness , I succeed , save that struggled child .
When I went the river - side bank , I saw some red - faced .
I enjoyed it and found worthy to visit .
The Annual International Arts Festival , which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November , was colourful with the stars and artist coming from around the world .
You could have let us get used to more cultures by inviting from some other countries too .
So I could hardly participated in all of the concerts .
The organisation was very good I found chances to see dance shows , art exhibitions and to listen to writers , but there could be more plays and films next year .
It was really a reasonably - priced weekend for me , but you should also recognise new activities like competitions on singing songs , drawing a portrate next year .
Yours Sincerely ,
I 'm in a hurry , so I will directly come to the point .
Everywhere and everytime in our lives we face with the rules .
Some find them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them .
At schools we have certain rules like being in the class , sitting in your place before the lecture starts , bringing in your equipment with you , keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk .
I think these are international rules which help things to go in order .
Contrary there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones .
It makes us like robots and feel bad psychologically , because we want to be different and free in wearing .
If we do n't come to school for 10 days , then we ca n't pass the class .
They do n't care if we have problems , exams to study or if we are ill .
At homes we have again rules , but more flexible ones . You should be punctual when coming to dining table , respectful , do your home works and watch TV less and not too loud .
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school , but I do n't have the enough power .
I am writing to complain about a musical show that I saw in your theatre .
First of all , Danny Brook was supposed to act there , but he was replaced by another actor .
Secondly , the show should have started at 19:30 p.m. , and it began fourty - five minutes later .
Moreover , when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were avaliable .
Furthermore , I wanted to have a coffe after the show , but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant , it was closed .
A police officer who was there told me that the manager of the restaurant was ill and that he did n't allowed anyone to open it .
For all that reasons , I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money back to my house .
Her school 's class - matters were going to give their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise to her .
The event was going to take place in the garden of Paula 's house .
That day afternoon they arrived at Paula 's house in order to decorate the place .
Ballons and coloured lights were put in all the trees .
A table was laid with a lot of delightful food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it .
Some time later all the things were finally prepared .
But things did n't happen as they had been planned .
I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in you competition .
If the answer is yes , could you tell me which kind of clothes I will need .
I look forward to receiving you reply .
Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings , sing along parties and indoor games .
Ordinary lessons attended by students from different levels .
Ordinary lessons , it is a good way of showing the relationship between students and teachers .
In order to confirm my schedule for travel I have won in your competition , I am writing some information to you below .
I would like to go to " Camp California " on July because I will have to produce " Mission Impossible III " from August .
I will be busy to decide everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there .
I would prefer in tents as a accommodation because it sounds thrilling and even ecstatic for me and also I have never tried this kind of accommodation before .
To produce a film is very hard work . I must keep a good condition to make a masterpiece .
Swimming is really nice for my relaxing and I can do exercise for a long time .
Your sincerely ,
By the way , Do you want to hear my experience about pop concert ?
There are a lot of people .
I conveyed a lot of chairs and looked after the que or people who lost their way .
" X " is the musician who sang songs at a pop concert .
My aim joining this concert as a stuff was that I could see " X " .
The concert was enthusiastic and even made me ecstatic .
His voice is also soulful and sometimes even gave us blissful .
Hope we join the next pop concert together as a stuff and enjoy our time !
As we are going to be in London on this date , we think , it could be a great oppurtunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions , make up , etc . and it is free for students .
Because of this reasons , we would kindy ask you to change the programme , so that we could go to this especial event .
We suggest visiting the Science Museum in the afternoon on Wednesday 15 March and canceling the Shopping on Tuesday 14 March .
Hoping on your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you .
An especiall invitation
I was having holidays with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food .
One day we were invited from locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli .
Although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity visiting a place with no tourists , I was a little bit scared .
In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean , but in the little town we did n't had this possibility and the family where we were staying with , kindly boiled the water for us .
The first week was find , but on the second week I got very seek .
Some days later we went back to Dehli and having being to the doctor and having again bottled water , I was feeling healthy again .
I have seen your advertisement in " the Sun " newspaper on 10th November , and I went to the festival on last Friday .
Most of the events were wonderful and well - organised .
I enjoyed it , but I think it could be even better next year , so I would like to give my inmature views of it .
I made people enjoyed their weekend , relaxed themselves , also it brought the foreign culture to them , enlarged their kownlegth .
In addition to it , one weekend ticket for all events was only £ 10 , this was excellent , it made people only spend pocket - money , and then they could watch all the events at the weeked , for them it is really economical to spent their weekend .
So my friends told me that was his cheapest weekend .
Moreover , the stars and artists were only from six countries , In my opinion , if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries , it will make the festival more exciting , more intesting , and from my point of view , some concert halls were too small , the people in there could n't even go to the loo ! because it was too crowed .
Finally , the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed , as far as I 'm concerned .
If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect .
This are only my inmature views , if it is considerable for you , I will be very pleased , thank you very much .
I 'm look forward to hearing your replies .
It was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday , you asked me about rules ; both at my home and at my school , I am very happy to tell you about this .
At my school , we are n't allowed to smoke inside the building , because the building is made of wood , it tend to catch fire easily , and we are n't allowed to use Internet , there are only ten computers in the school , only teachers can use it , if we used , we would be sent to the head office of the school .
At my home , there are many rules , because I 'm careless , so I amn't allowed to smoke at home as well : and I 'm not allowed to use telephone , because last year I made £ 1000 bill for one month , my parents were very angry with it , so they told me I am not to use telephone any more , oh , How poor !
How is the weather like in England , I hope it is n't too wet , please give my regards to your parents .
I am writing to make a complain about your theatre and the musical show , , Over the rainbow " .
Firstly , in your advertisement was said that Danny Brook has a part in the show , but there was a different actor in the play .
Secondly , there was written in the advertisement , that the show begins at 19.30 , however , it started at 20.15 .
According to the advertisement , discounts should be available , but , in fact , I was refused to take the payment for tickets in this way .
It was very uncamfortable for me .
Everybody , who came to it 's doors , had to go to the other restaurant in bad mood .
I could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous , but it was not even quite interesting .
You promised me perfect evening out , but it was one of the most terrible in my life .
She was 25-years - old secretary in one big company .
Her boss was rich man , really rich .
He was one of the most famous person in his city , but he was n't honest with his clients .
One of them was about her boss ' private life : he had got illegal son .
Timson 's wife , who was good looking and young , could n't know about this , but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment .
He even could n't say a word .
He tried to make up who could give his wife knows .
Of course , only one person had known this except his best friends .
This was his secretary Pat , however , he could n't be sure and decided to check it up .
Next day he understood that he was right .
Timson had a row at home and also needed new secretary .
It was the worst weekends in a last few years .
On the other hand , now everything is o.k .
Timson has a good close family , his son lives with them , his company makes a good profit ...
Only Pat has problems , she should earn her living in other company again !
Dear Sir/ Madame ,
Today a recived your letter , it is the most wonderful news I here in a long time .
I am so please that I won this prize , that I can not explain how greateful I am .
I wasen't expecting this prize because was to good to be true .
My family decide to visit my grandmother in Orlando , because she got some problems with the swiming - pool , she ask my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building .
Because this situation I be very busy on the first week of july , and I apreciate if you can give me the choice to start my " Camp California " from July 10th .
About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep on the tents , because I never been in one , and it is a lot more fun than log cabins .
Because I seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very kind on this sport , and also I love photography because I got a great Camara .
I am really looking forward to see you soon .
When I was a child I never like to go shopping because my Mum spend so much time on the shops that I remember going shopping with her , was a nigthmare .
It is ameaising how people change during the years , for example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things , and every week I have to buy something .
I enjoy so much fashion that my life change completely since I start to study clothes designer and I discover that fabrics , colors , are really enjoyable .
But in this days shopping is not always enjoyable , because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay full price , on the end of the season it is half price , I find very anfair for people who pay a lot of money on their clothes .
Anyway , shopping is allways a satisfation for rich people , because they can afforded and they do n't main to spend full price on their clothes .
I write you because last friday I had a very disappointing evening in your theatre .
I went there because I had read a banner about the musical show " Over the rainbow " , but many informations were wrong .
Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see how the famous Danny Brook act .
But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the show of 2.30 p.m. , we could n't enter in the theatre because the discounts were n't available .
So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes until the beginning of the show !
No only : we had the bad surprise that Brook had been substituded by another actor !
I ask you if is it possible to have my money back , please , because I want to forgot that expense .
Modern technology ca n't not transforme our daily life .
The inventions of the airplane , of the train and of the car , have reduced the distances of the world , so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day .
It means that daily life is faster and busier because I 'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon , and after few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band , then I can go back home when I want , listening the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car .
So I have must more interestings things to do in my life .
But the most important innovation of technology development is the computer .
In everytime of the day I can communicate with people of all nationality of the world , I can have informations about everything , I can buy something which I ca n't find in the shops of my town , so I can do anything just clicking on the mouse !
Sometimes , computer substitudes real relationships between people .
In fact , many boys pass several hours in front of their computer and the forgive that out of their houses there are their friends ....
In conclusion , I think that modern technology get my life more interesting , but I prefer to stay with my friends and with my girlfriend then in front of a computer !
I am writing to complain about the Musical Show , I have seen last week .
There is some disagreement a between your advertisement and show , which I could see at the Circle Theatre .
First of all , I would like to indicate that you put wrong starting and finishing hours .
The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have mentioned .
It was very surprising for me and I had got a lot of trouble with coming back home at night - when it finished .
Furthermore , there was no Danny Brook at the stage .
She is my famous artist and I was coming there mainly because of him .
If this made me really disappointed - he was n't playing there .
Another point , I want you to consider , is restaurant .
The place you have offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all .
Despite changing the hours , you have closed the restaurant without any reason .
Could you possibly explain why you did n't provide us anything to eat ?
Finally , you have advertised , I would have perfect evening out .
I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for giving my money back .
I think , this could be the only , right possibility for me , to forget about my not interesting evening .
I would appreciate it , if you could consider my complaint .
Try to imagine : the wide , colourful street with many fantastic cars and shinny large shops .
Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes on them .
It 's a REALITY , its the FASHION OF THE FUTURE ...
People were wearing almost everything , during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth .
Everything was changing : style , colour qual . Fashion .
We saw almost all kinds of skirts , trousers , coats , skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures .
What something new hasn't been invented for now ?
I say it to you - black and grey .
These are two powerful colours , which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years .
The climate is changing , so we would have only two seasons .
I hope , there will be times , when women would like to be again thought as delicate and sensible human beings .
Showing their figure , they would have possibility to show their sexuality .
But , do n't forget , any exhibitionism !
We have too many taken off people around us , now .
And it will be the past .
Streets of 21st century will be smart .
If not , you are very poor .
Grey and black - like weather seasons , like people charakters , like all night and dark sourranding us .
Recently , I had a week 's holiday in London and during my stay , I went to your theatre to see " Over The Rainbow " and I was really disillusioned .
In the advertisement , it was told that Danny Brook was starring , but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really dissapointing .
I could not see any portion of Danny Brook 's performance at him .
Also , in the schedule , the time of the show was written as 19:30 , but it started at 20;15 and , I missed the dinner I was going to have with my best friend in London .
Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill gates , I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets ; but I had to give the exact price of the ticket , which I consider as a fault of your theatre .
In addition to these , it was mentioned that your restaurant was open after the show , but it was not because there was no food to be served .
As you can understand , it was a dreadful time and I went my money back as a solace for the dissapointment I had .
Yours Sincerely ,
Also , I use my computer and Internet very much in order to reach some information , do my projects and communicate with my friends .
I do not have to wait for a letter for days and I gain so much time again .
on the other hand , because of dealing with computers so much , I can not see my family and friends very much , even when we are at the same medium .
But despite this , I am very happy with the facilities of technology in my daily life .
Dear Ms Jane Clark ,
Recently I visited an arts festival , organized with your help .
I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation is great .
However , I have some proposals about its improving next year .
At first , I propose to invite stars and artists not from all the world , but from only six countries .
This change will give opportunity to create some different performance .
The second my proposition is about classic concerts .
I suppose that some concert halls are too small , so you should be sure about it in advance .
This year I noticed that there were only few plays and films .
And , at last , I should congratulate you with the decision of making one weekend ticket for all events .
I support this idea which is convinient both for people and organisators .
I am looking forward for this festival next year .
Yours faithfully ,
It was really nice .
The things you wrote about in your letter are quite common for me , because we , actually , have some problems about our rules .
At first , about school .
I 'm really fed up with our school forne !
It is awfull !
Off course , if we had such pretty forne like yours , we would wear it with pleasure .
What should I say you about home ...
We are quite friendly family , that 's why we actually do n't have some special rules .
However , we promised our perents to make cleaning up every week .
This is all I wanted to write you about rules .
I 'm looking forward to see you next summer after my exams .
Write me what do you think about it .
During my stay in London I decided to see a musical show called " OVER THE RAINBOW " but , unfortunately I was very disappointed .
At first , as I have read in your advertisement , Danny Brook should have stared in this show .
A different actor has appeared , but I must say that he was very disappointing .
I had to wait for the show for over fourty five minutes , because it started at about 20:15 !
What is more , it has been written that I can get some discounts , but when I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket , it was impossible .
You have also placed a note about your theatre restaurant opened after the show .
I wanted to drink a coffee but , unfortunately it was closed , because the waiter went out !
It was not of course , so I would like to ask you kindly for my money back , because some information placed in your advertisement about the musical was not true .
Your faithfully ,
At first , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home .
For example : a fridge , a cooker or just an electricity .
Secondly , thanked to the technology , there are many ways of travelling today .
We produce cars , trains and plains which are better and better .
What is more , there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement .
Maybe it will be a remedium against AIDs or cancer soon .
On the other hand , the modern technology has some disadvantages .
The main is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world .
The second is the nuclear weapon and many wars , in which modern equipement is used .
To sum up , as far as I am concidered , modern technology has changed my life completely .
On the one hand it helps me a lot in daily life , but on the other I 'm afraid of the future everyday .
I am very pleased to see that I win the first prize in your competition .
Firstly , I would like to travel on July because I have some holidays during this month . I am working the rest of this summer .
I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now .
Unfortunately I am not so good in it .
But I would take the opportunity to improve myself .
In addition , I have some questions . I would like to know which sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary .
Our life of today is getting even more about consommation .
You always find more shops and they are open even more late .
Everybody is stressed , you have to make the queue .
It is not comfortable at all .
But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality .
You could try to do your shopping via Internet .
Perhaps you will find less inconvenience .
Last week , during my holiday in London , I had the opportunity to see the show " Over the Rainbow " at the Circle Theathre .
I was told that there were some discounts to students , but at the moment I bought the ticket , they charged me a full price .
The day of the show , we got to the theather at 19:30 .
Instead , due to some technical problems , it began at 20:15 .
Second , I was really disappointed when I found out that Danny Brook , the best actor I have never known and the reason for which I decided to see the show , was not going to be performing .
Third , the theatre restaurant was closed because the cheff did not show up .
In conclusion , I would appreciate if you could , please , send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected .
Pat knew something was wrong because she had known Sally since they were five years old , but she did not why she was acting so strange .
She had seen her stepfather hitting her mother everytime he was drunk .
She did n't want to tell the teachers at school or any other person because she was afraid that if her stepfather find out about that , he would get made and hit her , or even worse , kill her mother .
But she knew that Pat did it because she loved her and was afraid something horrible could have happened to her or to her mother .
I am very astonished that I won this competition !
It is great and I will say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California already .
I have never been in California yet .
Now I will give you the further information : I have to travel in July because I had to make sure that I can have holiday this year and it is the only possebility !
I am sure you can take attention on this .
I decided to have the accommodation at Camp California in a tent , because there you will have lots of fun .
You can feel the fresh air and listen to animals , this will be a great oportunety !
I am not well in both activities , but it will be a pleasure to try it espacially surfing , I would like to feel the air in my hair , and enjoy how quick the board goes over the sea .
Another question I have ; the live there , is it as expensive as I think ?
And the weather are they only sunshiny days ?
In the other hand it is not as important , the main reason is I really look forward to go at this Camp and one more time , thanks a lot !
We have recently had a discussion in our class about this statement , we have had a great argueing .
Certainly it is great to buy new clothes and have a great variety at home , to wear , but mostly you will have allways not enough .
When I decided to go for a shopping , first I will make sure that I have enough time .
I am not a typical women because I hate shopping !
I am lucky if I will find something which fits .
The main reason I hate , there are too many people who are always standing in my way ( or maybe I think in that way ) and I begin to be angry , normally I am looking those people with evil eyes !
I mean , it is too crowdy , you have to wait such a long time before you can pay , and mostly all the things are too expensive !
Even before you will find a color you like or the right size of the trousers , you were looking for it a long time , has gone !
Lastly , you can see , my opinion about shopping is not very good , then I think shopping is never enjoyable !
About two weeks ago , I went to London for a week holiday .
I was looking forward to a great evening , but much to my surprise , it was not exactly the case : there were no discounts available , as it was mentionned in the advertisement ; the show started 45 minutes late ; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook was replaced by someone else .
I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out , and I am therefore asking you a refund of the amount I paid , or part of it .
Yours faithfuly ,
Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot , I can even say changed it .
I will take the exemple of the use of the internet .
I do n't write letters to my friends anymore , and wait weeks before receiving answers , I just send an electronic mail through the internet and the person received it within seconds .
I do n't need to go to the stores anymore , if I do n't want to : I can just stay at home and buy almost everything through it : books , video tapes , clothes and even groceries .
I also have the possibility of making new friends : I can connect to a special site which will enable me to virtually meet people .
Dear Sir / MADAME ,
I am writting you because yesterday I went to the musical show " Over the Rainbow " and I had a bad evening .
First of all , in the advertisement says that the starring were different actors , and there were n't different one , so that can not be .
Also in the advertisement says , that the show will begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 ; that mean that I have to cancelled a date that I had at 21:00 , because I coudn't make it .
If you present a show you must be on time .
Another thing that happened was that the tickets did not have discount and the advertisement says the will have .
So , how is possible that you present an advertisement and you do n't make what it say ?
Finally , it supose to have the restaurant open , and it was n't , because they did n't have electricity to cook , so they close it .
I am really made and I want my money back , please call me to the number 23456789 , I will be waiting your call .
Thank for your time
your sincerelly
Modern technology have change my daily life in many aspects .
First of all at work ; computer are really amazing , you only need to turn it on and start to write ; your work is more clean and you work faster .
Also change my free time , they had invented great games like play station , and you can have a really good time with your friend playing .
In the early day , on a raining day you could n't play because most of game were outside the house but now with the technology you can make many things in your house .
Another aspect is , on the house artefacts , microwaves , laundrymachine , make life easily .
In my opinion technology have made human life easily , funier and more comfortable .
I had been to London recently for a week 's holiday and I have been to a musical show in the Circle Theatre .
When I saw the advertisement about the show I got very excited , because I always wanted to see " Over the Rainbow " , but I had some problems , and I want you to know about that .
First of all , when I bought the tickets I had no discount , and in the advertisement it was mentioned that people would have some , and when I got in the theatre to see the play , I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun .
I had had not a perfect night at all , so I would like to ask if I can have my money back .
Nowadays , we do not need anymore to spend hours cooking , for example : we just put some frozen food in the microwave , and in a few minutes our meal is ready .
We can communicate with people in distant countries in real time , using the internet .
There is a lot of other examples of how technology has changed people 's lives .
I would not do my school projects without using a computer , because I have to do some statistical analysis that I would not do with a calculator .
An other thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone , because people can talk to me whenever they need , but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when I am in an important meeting .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because this is the beggining of my holidays , and I would not like to miss some of my school classes .
Besides , I would preffer to stay in tents , because I got used to being in tents since each summer I spent my holidays with my friends at the hills .
In adittion , I would rather playing tennis .
I also like surfing , I think it is a dangerous sport , but I know how to practice it , because of the fact that last year a proffessional surfer tought me .
From my point of view , shopping is not always enjoyable , because sometimes when you are looking for a special good you never find it .
Besides , I do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products , that make you feel confused and you do n't know which one fits you , instead of being with my friends or doing something else .
Moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes .
Although it is wonderful to buy new things , there are times that it really become tiring .
To summarize , I could say that if you want to buy something , first make sure what sort of product you need and then , go shopping .
If not shopping never be enjoyable , but also tiring and boring .
I'M WRITING YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " WICH WAS PRESENTED LAST WEEK .
YOUR ADVERTISING LEAFLET WAS COMPLETELY WRONG , IT SAID THAT DANNY BROOK WAS ACTING BUT , WHEN I GOT THERE , THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY ON STAGE .
THE TICKETS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISCOUNTS BUT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE WRONG , THEY NEVER GIVE ANY DISCOUNTS TO ANYONE .
AFTER THE SHOW , I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED ON THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED .
I'VE NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS .
FOR ALL THIS REASONS MY EVENING WAS TERRIBLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AT LEAST PART OF MY MONEY BACK .
YOURS SINCEARLY
SINCE I WAS BORN , SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER , JUST AS EXAMPLE , INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY .
THIS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR LIFE IN MANY WAYS AND WE ALMOST DON'T NOTICE IT .
IN MY CASE , I'M COMPLETELY INTEGRATED WITH THEM , ALMOST EVERYTHING I DO I USE THIS TECHNOLOGY .
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO READ BOOKS , WRITE , LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND , NOWADAYS , YOU CAN DO ALL THIS THINGS USING A COMPUTER .
IT 'S ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS THAT MEN INVENTED IT 'S POSSIBLE TO DO LOT 'S OF THINGS AND TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO USING A PC .
MOST OF MY DAY I SPEND IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE MACHINES , STUDYING , RESEARCHING , PLAYING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD .
THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO IT 'S BAD ASPECT , IT MAKES YOU MORE FAR FROM PEOPLE , ISOLATED FROM TRUE RELATIONSHIPS BUT YOU CAN HANDLE IT WHEN YOU GOT USED TO THIS .
Dear Helen Ryan .
I 'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me some details .
Because I am a university student , I have got classes until the midle of June and I have to attend to a ' Development & Research Conference ' at the end of June .
Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as a assistant from the beginning of Aguest .
I have ever slept in tents when I went camping .
That time I had to sleep in tent .
Whole night , I felt backache ands shoulder ache so I could n't sleep very well .
Especially I love water - painting .
It will be fantastic experience for me .
Actually I ca n't swimming at all .
That why I could n't have swimmed yet .
I think this chance is very good for me to learn to swim .
I expect to join above two activities .
But I think I 'll need some money for clubing or evening events .
I 'll buy some clothes , shoes and a hat .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Your sincerely
Whenever I walk in the street , I always want to go into the every shops .
I always want to buy T - shirts , Jeans , Skirts , cosmetic , hairband , accessories , ring , earings , bracelet , shoes , hats , bags , fancy stationeries , interior stuffs and CD .
I have to chose some of them and I have to give up buying most of them .
Before I go out home , I make a plan .
What is I want to buy and I decide to buy some items .
But when I stand at every shops , I ca n't stand my desire .
If I have got enough money to buy something what I want to buy , I can buy them and it will be no problem .
If I haven't got enough money , I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be very big problem .
I 'll think why I 'm so poor .
But I can get over .
Insead of buying something , I buy some fresh food and Ice - cream .
I can try every shoes , clothes , hats , accessories and jakect on .
But if you think positive opinion about shopping , It will make you the happiest and the riches man in the world .
The show should have started at 19.30 , but it delayed forty - five minutes .
And , the worst of all : Danny Brook was not on stage .
He was replaced by a novice actor who made a very disappointing performance .
Last , the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a tube and the kitchen was flooded .
I think there are sufficient reasons for money back . I just wanted to have a pleasant evening out and I could ever imagine that there would be so many troubles .
I really expect that you consider my arguments and cash me back the value of the ticket , as soon as possible .
Nowadays , I feel myself entirely linked to these innovations , and I would find it hard to live without them .
Internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations .
Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data , that would take a much longer time to be found by traditional means .
For a shy person , like me , Internet has another attractive : the possibility of knowing people and making friends worldwide .
Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes , but it can be very useful in certain situations : when your car is broken on the road , when you need to be found anywhere and at any time ( if you are a doctor , a lawyer or a journalist , for instance ) , and so forth .
Modern technology granted other facilities : I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait on a big queue to be attended by the cashman , I can exchange photos and videos via computer , I can do business and make money at home , and so on .
First of all , I 'd like to travel in July because I have to work except that month .
I prefer staying in tents because it is unusual experience for me .
Also I 'd like to have the chance to play tennis and sailing at the camp .
Second , how much money to I need ? I haven't a clue about it .
As I mentioned before , I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month , the artist 's name was " Bonny Pink " who is famous in my country .
I thought it was most exciting job .
Actually , I could have a chance to ask her about music , her favorite artist and her hobby .
I was impressed when I heard that she liked playing puzzle alone .
She seemed to be very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had very gentle attitude when she spoke to me .
It was very interesting experience for me .
I wish you were there .
I hope you can enjoy .
Anyway it 's the time to go to bed .
Third , I have chosen ' Tennis ' and ' Photography ' for my activities at the Camp .
This bank is not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A very famous .
The music instruments were transported from the lorries ( three big lorries ! ) into the concert hall and I helped to put them at the right position on the stage .
They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band .
I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in flesh .
I was so exited and happy that I ca n't remember what I talked with the band .
I 'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show .
Indeed , instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ; we had mean actors .
As for the times , the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15 .
Likewise , there were no discounts avalaible .
To end , in spite of being opened , the restaurant was closed for reparations .
Because of all those inconvenients , I ask you a total refund .
I 'm sure you will accept my request ; if not I intend to take legal actions against your company .
So when Caroline , his girlfriend , told him something personal and very important ; because she trusted in him ; immediatly he came to see one of his friend to tell him the secret .
When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students of her class knew about what she had just said the day before to Pat .
So immediatly she went towards Pat , angry , in order to argue with him , saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved , and that it was n't the first time that he was n't capable of keeping a secret .
Because of his behaviour , now Pat is alone and nobody trust in him .
All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have set , they are quite interesting , especially the river trip to Greenwich , because some of us may go to the university there next year .
So we can walk around and see how it looks like in Greenwich .
All of us want to go to this trip , but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , and we all would like to go there .
It is from 10 am to 7 p.m. , it is about the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles , all of us are really interesting , and it is free for student to get in as well .
It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design , and we can learn loads of things in there .
So may you please change the visit of the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon , and we can cancel our shopping and free time , so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday .
Yours Faithfully .
It was two years ago , me and my classmates went to a leadership trip in London .
This trip was organised by our form tutor , he wanted to test us if we trust each other and worked in a team , and the trip last for 3 days .
The first days was going fine , we just had to do some teamwork things .
In the second day , we had to climb up a twenty metres hill with our hands .
It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in a high place since I was young .
So I started to climb really slow and careful , and I climbed about 15 metres quite success , so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away .
But after I climbed two steps more , my right feet slipped over , I was nearly fell down , but luckly my hand caught a rock , it was dangerous , but I did n't had any choice , finally I did it .
I am writing to complain about the musical show : Over the Rainbow , presented in your theatre on 15th of June .
I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student .
However , the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out . I could not understand why but still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook .
Then , I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15 , forty - five minutes after the expected starting time .
Furthermore , I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished .
At last , I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning .
I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement .
Now everybody in the class knew my mum was a cleaner and teased me for having such kind of mum .
I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologise for thousands of times .
Some offered a high salary while some did .
However , they are equal important for our society . '
But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner , nobody raised his hand and I felt so shameful that I lowered my head . '
Mrs Brown said with a loud voice . '
If there were no cleaner , who would clean the school for us , who would keep the environment nice and tidy . '
Suddenly , all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect .
The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart : ' All the jobs have the same importance . '
Being on a holiday trip in London , I dreamed to go to the theatre for a musical show .
I saw your advertisement last Monday , and thought " It is that one that I want to try . "
In fact , your musical show was attractive : actors , time , restaurant , discount tickets , and also the title ! I started to be OK with the " Your perfect evening out " , sure not to be deceived .
But all was disappointing !
First , as I am very found of Danny Brook , I have been surprised he totally changed his voice , face , and so on !
It was not Danny on the scene !
Second bad point : beeing not narrowminded , I accept other actors .. but if the show begin on time - he began at a quarter past eight P.M.
There were no discount places because it was not planed like this by the theatre .
What was written on the advertisement ?
The summum was reached when I saw the restaurant was closed for " holidays " .
I was terribly ennoyed !
I spent the worse evening of my holiday in this show !
So I need now a " perfect - money back - " for replacement of your " perfect evening out " .
Up to two years ago , I was working with a written booknote or agenda , and I used to phone with a wired phone system .
Nowaday , I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that authorizes me to connect to Internet by infra - red link with my mobile phone to get informations and electronic mails .
I am always joinable with my mobile phone , that is also sometimes boring !
Being in an apprenticeship , I go both work and university .
At the university , I have learned with computer aided systems .
I often go on Internet to find informations for studying a precise subject more accutely ( university technology sites ) .
At work my personal job uses two standard PC with specifical softwares plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network ( SUN ) operating system and a particular computer that my firm is developping now .
At home , I have got a personal computer for my mails and accounts , and electronic mail plus internet for keeping connected to my friends that are at the other end of France or Germany , Korea and so on .
I saw the show on 17th of July .
Firstly , the advertisement claimed discount ticket was available .
Secondly , I bought a second musical show ticket which start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
Thirdly , your advertisement misled I could see Danny Brook in the show who I adore .
When I turned up the show , there was another actor instead of him .
Fourthly , after the show the theatre restaurant was closed because of it 's problems .
But I could go evening out .
To sum up , I believe your advertisement completely misled .
So I am fully entitled to ask for refund except for evening out .
I hope this matter will recieve your prompt attention .
Nowadays , mordern technology has increasingly been developing .
We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily , on the other hands , we get also many disadvantages which could harm us .
In my opinion , the main advantage is developing of medical technology .
For example , if you were hurt seriously like cutting leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body .
The more developing the technology is , the quicker and easier international networking is .
So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country .
In contrast , the technology can cause a pollution .
By developing of transport , we can get wherever you want to go easily , however it could cause serious air pollution like acid - rain and smog .
Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which has been combined with mordern technology .
In conculsion , I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two way .
One is advantage and the other is disadvantage .
I 'm writing this letter to you , because during my stay in London , I went to the theatre to see a musical show , and I had a very disappointing evening .
When I read the advertisement , I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show .
I appreciated him a lot .
When the show started forty - five minutes later , I realised that the main actor had been changed .
That change really disappointed me .
Another problem was that I did n't have any discount , and I was n't alone , we were five persons .
Our idea after the show , was to visit the theatre restaurant , but it was closed .
Nobody could give me an answer .
Please send me a letter , with the explanations for all these problems that I told you .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good a keeping secrets .
Manuel had a farm , no so long from the town , where we could do whatever we wanted .
But what was the problem .
We were too young to stay a hole weekend alone .
I thought of the idea of telling our parents that we had a camping with the school .
We were all agree .
We were very calm , discussing the last details of our weekend , when we heard a noise that came out from a room that was near us .
Manuel opened the door , and there she was , Pat with Ramiro 's sister hearing all our conversation .
Thanks a lot for your briefly and nice letter .
Firstly , the most suitable month would be in July because I am very busy in my work now , and my children are in holiday then .
I confess you that I have never been in a tent and till now I have never had the intention to do it .
The activities are really interesting and I would take part on Painting and Climbing .
I am not very good painting , but I like it because is a good oportunity to practice it .
I do n't want to dissapoint you , but I am beginner !
I would appreciate if you can tell me a couple of ideas about clothes I need there .
Sincerely ,
Not only bad characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones , but also this take your attention .
In this book , Heathcliff as a child had n't a bad character but the situations lived with the family Earnshaw , where the grown up , made him rude , agresive and noisy .
They were good friends but Heanly , brother of Catherine , hatted Heathcliff .
Heanley could n't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and , for that reason he sent Heathcliff to work in the farm .
In the mean time Catherine knew Edgar Linton and at the end she married Edgar because of money and good education .
Heathcliff promised himself and worked his whole life taking a revenge .
Before Heathcliff died he riched what he wanted .
The houses and money of the families Earnshaw and Linton , all belonged to him .
and he was buried near to Catherine ! , his great and only love !
Thank you a lot for your kind letter .
I was very surprised on the result of the competition .
I think it would be better for me to travel on July .
I will started an Italian course in August , so it will be impossible for me to leave .
In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins , well I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals .
I saw , you offer a lot of activities , that'is fantastic !
It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like and I can also do the best .
I think I choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church chorus and I do it very well .
The other activity I like very muche is swimming .
I took part at a lot of competitions .
Now I would like to ask you if wee need some money and if it is necessary to take with me special clothes .
I hope I have give to you all the information you needed and I am looking forward to hearing from you .
I am happy to tell you about the experience I made at the pop concert last month .
We first had to prapare the stands with food and drinks and buy something which had been forgotten .
Then we had to put on the night lights and decorate the whole room .
In the afternoon the singers cames in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin .
He is very beatiful !
At the end of the interview he invites me to have dinner with him after the concert . I logically accepted .
The interview I liked particularly Before the concert started , we had to verify all music instruments .
The microphones all had to be controlled .
Fortunatly we had no problem .
I was very proude of me and the work I had done .
After concert I left with Ricky Martin .
I am sure my dear Kim , I will never forget that wonderful experience .
Now I hope you will answer soon and tell me a bit of your adventure or experience you had in last time .
lot of kisses
I went to the Circle theatre last week on monday and I would say that I had a very disappointing evening , there .
Firstly , I 've read in the advertisement that the actors who were playing that night were D. Brook and T. Truelove .
To sum up , It was n't a " perfect evening out "
Modern technology has completly changed my daily life , which became more comfortable , and easier .
Yet my hand phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere .
But I think the best technological invention which changed my life is the internet - Thanks to it , I have hundred friends all over the world and I know many different cultures .
All these examples are very few demonstrations to show how technology could affect our lives nowadays .
In my point of view , modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions .
Thank you for the exellent programme you organised for our class .
We especially look for make the River trip to Greenwich .
However we have send an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which will take place on the Tuesday 14th March from 10.00 am to 19.00 pm during our trip in London and in which the follow topics will be showed :
Latest fashion
Make up
We would like to inform you that we all extremly interested in this show and that it could be a great opportunity for us because the entrance is free for the studends .
We would like to request if we could go to this show on the 15th March instide off the visit in the Science Museum .
We could make this one on the Wednesday 15th March afternoon .
Thank you in advanced for your comprehention and we look forward to hearing for you .
Who have never dreamed to be a famous singer , sportman , actor or a politician ?
The success of these people is so big that they are known all over the World .
I think that this kind of people have a poor life because they never can be quiet because all the poeple know them and want to know a lot of things about them .
They have always to be careful about what they say and what they do .
In my opinion I think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life .
Firstly , because it is a lot of " scandale magazine readers " .
Secondly , because they have admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a " star life " look like .
In conclusion I think that people who are to much interested in other people life have not an interesting life and are unhappy !
I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to offer her , after work , a very good evening with your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " .
I had read about it that was a very enjoyable show !
Your advertisement was a quite lie and I have to tell you my disappointment .
Every point were wrong .
At first , from your advert Danny Brook ( who is a very good singer I appreciate very much ) was not here .
An unknown man was singing , not in tone - awful for my ears - ( poor Tina Truelove ! such a professional singer with a beginner ! )
At second , to go on with the beginning , your show started not at 19.30 but nearly one hour later ( 20.15 to be more precise ! )
And for the third point , I would hope to offer a good diner to my friend because I knew your restaurant as a famous place but I was still disappointed .
It was closed for some improvements !
I hope you will understand my evening was detestable and you will give me back my money .
I join this letter my two tickets .
Poor of I , I thought it was nice to have a friend and to be able to share lots of things !
I was very young when this story happened but though it was a child 's adventure I remember it yet .
I had read a very good book about pirates and I know I got a very creative imagination .
To make to profit my ideas my parents lived in a small village near a wonderful country .
Like my heros I would like to live in a ship and decided to build something in a tree .
Peaceful place and wonderful view .
With my friend Pat ( I put him in the confidence ) I started to work and my idea became real .
We could play hours and hours without seeing an adult or other children from the village .
I prefered it .
It was our secret Pat and I. Child 's secret .
But Pat could not keep it too long .
He had a fault : he talked a lot and told an other friend our story .
What a catestrophee !
All children went from the village and wanted to play with us .
I accepted them but I was very angry against Pat .
Our quietness disappeared and very fast everybody wanted to command my ship .
A desaster !
There was lots of fights between us and we were naughty like child could be with other child .
The result was my ship was destroyed and never more I could trust in any friend !
I am writing in reply to your letter , informing me that I have won the prize in your competition which is two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I would be really happy if I could apply Singing and Photography as the activities you have written about .
However , I used to assist my brother , who is a profecional photographer .
So that , I consider myself expirienced enough .
I am afraid that July is the only appropriate month , because I am due to start work in August .
Finally , I would like to ask you for further information about spending allowance and the clothes which I am supposed to take .
Last month , I helped at a pop concert which I really enjoyed .
The singer , who took place , was n't one of my favourites , but having the opportunity to experience being stuff there , was just amazing .
I was supposed to help my friend with the lights , so that I could see all that screaming like made crowd .
I even saw crying girls , who were trying to reach the pop - singer .
Do you know what Kim , I 've never thought before , that enjoying yourself like this , could be weirdly .
I think you never realize this , until you 're not a part of the crowd .
But I 'm really happy , that I had even small role in making people enjoying themselves .
I mean , all that flashing lights , the changing colours of them , I believe they helped much .
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was , I consider myself being very successful .
And finally , the greatest news . I was introduced to the singer by my friend , who works for him .
He was so nice and he even gave me his picture whit his signature on it .
I suppose , I will never forget that night .
That 's about all my news , I 'm looking forward hearing from you .
Last week I spent my holiday in London and I 've seen your musical " Over the rainbow ' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed .
When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems .
The advertisment says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them .
The times were also not alright , actually the show starts at 19.30 but in this evening it started at 20.15 .
The advertisment also says that there are discounts available but this is not true , there were none .
Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of holiday .
Why do you give those information in an advertisment .
For me it was really not a perfect evening , I was expecting a nice evening but in fact it was terrible .
Because of these problems I had I would like to ask for a compensation , maybe to get my money back .
I hope you understand my complains .
I wish you answer me soon .
In my opinion the modern technology has changed my daily life not really a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine .
I grew up in a world with full of technology and for me the development in the technology is not very big .
Of course , it changes , it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet .
It becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything .
I also do n't write letters anymore because I write e - mails to my friends .
That goes quicker and it is easier for me .
But I think in my generation it is not a really big difference .
In comparison to my grandparents they have really problems to accept these changes in modern technology .
Thank you very much for this occasion I 'd like to travel only in July , because , in the rest of the year , I 'm working in a bank .
About the accommodation , I 'd prefer to stay in log cabins , because for me and my family 's more comfortable .
I have a baby and three dogs , so it should be better in log cabins .
I 'd like spend all of time in a swimming - pool because I love swimming .
I like also surfing , because I love the wind in the hair and the fresh on my body .
Only one question about a baby 's accomodation .
Let me say still thank you .
I 'm looking forward to meting you
I 'm sorry I did n't write you before , but I was so busy with my exams .
So , You do n't believe me , but I enjoed helping at a Oasis 's pop concert .
I was a great and wonderful experience .
The group needs to found a good microphone for the concert , because the singer lost his microphone last concert .
Me and my friend were there to hear the sound - check , and when I understood was happing on the stage , I decided to help them .
Of course you know , I 'm a singer , so I came back quigky to my home , I picked my microphone , and I handed it to the singer .
I was so glad , because in the ending of show the singer kissed me and dedicated to me a lovely song .
Can you immagine ?
Ok , write me soon , huge hug and kisses
With the reference of the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on the 22nd of MAY 2000 , I , as a consumer , who is a musical show avid and a great fans of Danny Brook , who is said to be stared in the show , would like to complain about the presentation .
1 . First of all , I was really furious of watching a show starring by a different actor , instead of Danny Brook .
whose name was stated on the advertisement .
Besides this , the show started almost 45 minutes later than what it was said to be .
The Price of the ticket was said that there would be discounts available .
However , I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show .
3 . I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not opened after the show due to the shortage of food sold .
I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off .
With all the above points , I would like to ask for some money return .
I would consider to bring this complains to the court if I do not receive any agreeable explaination from the theatre .
Your faithfully ,
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past , now and also in the future .
However , things re recycling from time to time .
So do the objective of wearing clothes .
I will imagine that , people in the future , for example 100 years from now , will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past .
The people in the past wear clothes to protect themselves from the cold air , hot weather and strong wind .
On the other hand , the people in the future will propably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water , the harmful ultra - violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is result of a developed and full - grown country .
I think people in the future will likely to wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided .
It is because of the increasing number of population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere .
They will also wear water - proof , ultra - violet proof and other dangerous liquid - proof clothes to protect themselves These clothes have to be made of something light , suitable to wear and protective .
All the above ideas are needed to make them bare no burden when wearing these special designed clothes .
The future is a hope and a dream for everyone in the earth .
Therefore , I will suggest that we all nov to keep the enviroment clean and healthy for the next generation .
When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very exited about the idea of seeing it , plus when I heard about the facilities that the circle theatre was giving , it becomed the best oportunity I ever had to asist to a musical of that category , but instead of being the best evening I ever had , it was a total disaster and that 's the reason why I am writting to you .
Like I have already told you , instead of being the perfect evening , it was the worst I ever had .
First , the actors that the Circle theatre publis in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not , which was very disappointing because , the actors were starring the musical , was one of it mayor attractions .
Another point that I want to comply about , is the time that the musical was supposed to start ( 19:30 ) but it started at 20:15 , so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it , but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy , and not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service , and uncomfortable seats .
In consequence of the reasons I have already explained , I would like to ask you if I can have my money back , but this is not the most important to me , because I want your theatre to change and become the best .
Science and Technology is a theme very discussed nowdays , most of the comunity of our city , and of the world , were technology has arrived , confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life .
And I think it 's the same to me , because when advances in technology like computers , internet , etc .
Answering the question : " How has modern technology changed my daily life ? , I can confirm , that it has been in many ways , and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the internet , because it was easiest to me , and to every one , to make your home works , school works , and in fact , it was easier to me to search for information that in the past I would have to look at in a library .
But not all about technology and computers is good , because many people , and me in a control way , had become computer 's an thechnologic 's slaves , and we can not do anything without a machine , and I am not saying that it 's wrong or bad , and I accept that they make easier our daily tasks , but we have to mantain our independence as humans .
Technology , in fact it has made an improvement on daily tasks , but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our brain will become atrophied .
Dear Miss Ryan .
I am writing to inform the further information about myself .
I was very glad to hear that I won the competition .
I have a summer holiday from at the end of June to at the begging of September as I am a student , but I am planing to work in August as a part - time job .
So that 's the reason why I can not travel in August . I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins , because I have had a camping once and I stayed in tents .
It was great to have a fun and also it was very good memorise .
I am quite good at singing and I have a talent about singing that I can entertain people by singing .
In addition I am keen on swimming but actually I am not very good at swimming because I have just started to learn swimming but I have really been enjoying it and I think it will be good chance to improve my swimming .
In fact , I have some questions that how much money I will need , what else I have to bring with and if I have a emergency what you can do for .
Once again , I am very happy to have such a good opportunity and I hope this letter can bring what you want to know about me .
These days , there are so many people like shopping that it is one of the important part in our life .
It is not , however , always enjoyable that there are both advantages and disadvantages .
First of all , there are quite many advantages of shopping are that it can be the solvation of our stress and boring .
When you are under stress or when you are bored , if you go to shopping , then at least it can be motive to change your mode .
Also shopping makes people happier by using a lot of money and it influnce even economic situation more flexably .
When we are having a shopping , we often find that the place where people often go for a shopping is too crowed and it makes us more tired .
Also there are plenty of dangerous that lots of people have wallet stollen because it is a public place and there are too many people .
In addition shop owner often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly .
The customer can never know what price is the normal unless they have a same shop or same thing .
To sum up , shopping is very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun , however it is not always enjoyable which means we can not find only advantages from it .
Dir Madam !
I 'm realy enjoyed I won your competition !
I 'll give you nessesserly information about me .
The most suitable time for me is Jule because in August I intend to go in the countryside , where I have a small farm .
So , because of that I can only then .
I 'd like to stay in the log cabins , because I do n't like wet places like tends after rain .
You ofer me a lot of activities .
I went to try surfing and climbing because I 've never done it .
I 've got also two questions .
How much money I need to stay at Camp California and what kind of clothes I should take with me ?
You 'd like to know how was the Top - Pop Concert , which I helped to organise last month .
It was absolutlly great !
I was responsible about a security of one of the sectors .
I gave information about correct ways to another places like tooletes and medical points .
I was also asked about a timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs , knifes and so on in bags .
I was big fun !
People danced , screamed and sung with a singer .
I looked very carefully at organisation of the event , you know I 'm interestsing in it .
OK . I 'd better stop now because I 'm going to go to a library .
I look forward to hear some news from you !
I was so suprise to hear from you .
I could n't believe that I had won the first prize on the competition .
I 'm so happy because it is the first time that I win something .
Here it is all your information .
I would like if you could to have my vacation trip on July because is the only time of the year that my job could let me have a vacation .
As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it is my first time that I 'm going to camping and I would like to see how the real life is .
I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities also .
I would like to choose swimming and the climbing .
I 'm a very good swimmer but I do n't know anything about climbing that 's why I choose it because I want to try something knew .
At last I would like to ask you about my clothes and how the weather is going to be and what kind of clothes I must to take with me .
Thank you for making my dream come true
But noone is doing what he likes all the time .
There is times that you have to do something even if you do n't like it , and times that you are doing what you like but not the time you like it .
First because I 'm not so rich and second because I do n't enjoy to shop all the time .
Nothing in life is always enjoyable even the things we enjoy to do , and that 's how life is .
You say you enjoy shopping I understand but life goes on you ca n't do the same things every day .
live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do different things is exciting and more fun .
Because as I said to do what you like is good only if you do it when you like it and how you like it and remember if you have long time to do something the you enjoy it more .
Dears Ms. Helen Ryan ,
I was really greatful when I recieved your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition .
Because my school finishes end of June and I will have a month break after that I have to do a computing course which I have already applied for it .
Could you possibly tell me , at Camp California will I stay in tents or log cabins .
Personily I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents .
Unfortunetley I am not good at both of them .
Maybe I will have time to do enough practise as much as I always wanted to do .
Could you tell me what sort of clothes I would need to bring with me and will I need any extra money for this holiday .
Yours sincerly ,
I do n't know where to start but I can say it was the greatest time I have ever had .
As I mentioned you before Friend of mine , she is a stage assistant and she needed a help for that pop concert last month .
I told her if she need help I would be happy to help her .
Next day when I went there I have met lots of people very famous and very friendly .
the stage was covered with all sort of light and we made it look like a waterfall .
The waterfall made by real rock so that was the worst bit because they were really heavy and we had to carry them , but the end of moth when the concert started , it was all over .
I sung and dance all day .
I have lots of memory which I could never forget .
I hope you shared my happiness with me .
With attendance to the annual international arts festival which you took place on 21 and 22th November 2000 , I spend tremendous two days enjoying some features .
Then , I discovered some points and I am writing to express my suggestion and recommendations .
Firstly , the title ' International Arts Festival ' is very suitable for the festival , because there were some variety of features in it .
Next , One reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is also fantastic idea , because everyone could enjoy everything by the ticket .
However , according to my notes , there are some doubt in the festival .
While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world , they were from only six countries in fact .
The number of plays and films were also very few .
In addition to that some concert halls were too small to enjoy the concerts .
Therefore , I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls .
I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken place . I would be grateful to support you providing that you would like to make the festival more successful .
Yours sincerelly
Thanks for your letter , it was great to hear from you .
I know you 're fine , but I 've been very busy studying because I have to take exam next month .
So this is quick note to tell you what you want to know , as you asked about school rules and house ones .
At school , the most horrible one is school uniform .
I really hate it , because we 're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes , colourful shoes and colourful socks .
We ca n't also turn our hair colour an have to keep hair length above eye blows .
Next , we 're not allowed to get driver licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we 've students .
Just I ca n't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and I 'm not allowed to play computer games over two hours .
These are not so strict that I can stand them . I do n't think I want to change them .
Anyway , that 's all about my information which you want .
Write soon , I look forward to hearing from you .
According to your letter , I am writing to infrom you about the information you need to know for my trip two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am very excited and looking forward to the new experiance I am going to have .
First of all I must tell you that I only have freetime in July at any day , any week , because I am still having my lesson at college and it will be finished at the end of June and also in August I have a training course for my studies .
I would prefer to stay in tents because I love atmosephere of camping , but I would n't mind to stay in log cabins .
For the two activities I can choose , I would like to have swimming and Basketball .
I have always found these kind of activity make me fell strong and enjoy doing it .
I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9 , and I have been doing it up till now .
I also used to be in a basketball team in school for 3 years .
One thing , I would like to know is how many clothes I have to take with me and what kind of cloth they are ?
The aim of this report is describ and assess lesson and activities should be filmed in a short video .
It is base on information made availble by student from each class at school .
Most student who were interviewed suggested to have a speaking part of the lesson to be on film .
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson , because student always make some mistake while they are practising with thier partner , in spite of having told from teacher ten times .
It felt to be a good memory to be remember and remind our sleves to speak in a correct way .
This lesson will give us to be relaxed and have laugh .
We also would like to have a history on .
Going out to visit the history town every weekend seem to be the most enjoyable activity for student .
Spending time together out of the class is the nice experiance .
Having a sport after class it also fun .
Lesson and activities , which most student suggested are very interesting and it is not seem to be boring for the student .
I am so pleased to know that I have won such amazing prize in your competition .
I like to answer the questions you request from me .
Firstly , I should say that I would like to travel in July because of this is the month wich I could more likely have off at work for going on holiday .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents .
That is because I do not want to seem fuzy but I like to have some comodities when I am going on holiday and I think slepping over the floor without electricity it may annoy me .
Finally , I like to choose swimming as activity in the Camp . I love swimming and also I should say that I am very good at this sport because I have been doing that for long time .
On the contrary , painting is an activity wich I have never tryied before , so that I have not any skill in drawing but I like start doing that know when I have the chance .
On the other hand , I would like to know some imformation wich could be useful in my holiday like : which type of clothes could be more suitable for me in the Camp ?
Do I need to bring something else ?
If is so , please let me know as soon as possible .
to look forward to getting your Reply
I am writting to tell you about my experience in the last month pop concert , where I was helping my friend Nick who was the bouncer of the place .
That was a pop concert with lots of famous singers like Madona , Julio Iglesias , and people like them
That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA .
My job it was to accomodate to the people of the main sit of the theathre .
Of course those places were reserved just for people well - knowed who wanted to help by joined the concert .
So I had to ask them for their identifications and for their invitations .
After that , I have to take them to their respective sit .
At first , I was a bit scare , I mean I was afraid not be good enough to have a good performance as assistant ; but finally every thing went well .
I should say that it was the easiest and more interesting job that I have ever done .
I really enjoyed it and also I did not miss the opportunity to ask the artist to take a photho with me .
So , I hope to see you earliest to show all my phothos .
I think , it was very cleaver of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget , and that was the think that I more liked of that experience .
I 'm writting to you to make a complaint about your musical show : " Over the Rainbow " ... Last week , I , my husband and our two children went to your theatre spend a good time , but we were so disappointed .
First of all , I think it 's not professional to change the principal actor in the last minute , the play should be with Danny Brook , but it was n't .
In addition to this , the show started at 20:15 instead 19:30 , more 45 minutes in late ...
Moreover , there were n't discounts available like writting in your advertisement .
There was well a restaurant , even though , it was closed for reparations , also 2 hours 30 without drinking or eating something , was quite difficult for the children .
It should be a perfect evening out , but it was the opposite .
It 's why , it would be grateful , if you could give me my money back .
Nowadays , I think it could be impossible for us to live like our grand - parents or great grand - parents lived ... we are too lazy , but it 's not our mistake , this revolution is called " progress " !
Every day , like everybody , I watch the TV , see the International news , hear the radio , play games on my computer or get across with American or Asia people without going out to my house .
It seem be incredible , but it 's commun habits for us .. we do n't think that there is less of a hundred years , nothing of that existed .
I will always said thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the maschines wich make the washing and the washing - up , before this , the women spent a long time had done this tasks .
In addition to this , thinking also , to the medicine , science or astronomy progress ...
And it 's not ending , I hope that for my thirties I 'll go to Mars on holidays ...
The scientists are again ten years to find the solution ...
I am writing to suggest some idea for the International Art Festival next year .
I have just been there and noticed some points which could make the festival better .
There were a number of stars and artists from around the world , but from only six countries .
Secondly , they held some concerts , but some concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for the people .
Fourthly , everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks .
I suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event .
That is everything I have noticed about the festival . I would be grateful if you could think about it .
I 'm very happy to know you 're pretty well .
For example , girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees .
It does n't bother studying , does it ?
But there 's one thing I ca n't stand up .
I am writing to give you futher information about me which you need about Camp California .
I am delighted that finally , I have won the first prise in your Competition .
I would like to travel only in June because I will start working in July that means I will not be able to come there later .
It is not comfortable but it still like it .
Concerning to the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good in it because I have attended a relevant course for three months .
According to my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity .
I am looking forwards to hearing from you
Some people agree with it , some people not .
There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting .
Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes .
This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot .
On the other hand there are some disadvantages . for example if you are a working mother with three children , that means you are always n a hurry , going shopping is really unenjoyable .
You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue .
You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to .
In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy .
Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood .
Thank you very much for your letter which said I had won first prize in your competition .
I was really surprise to hear that .
I am afraid I can only make it on July , because I am taking exams this month .
Moreover , I 'll prepare everything for going to University on August .
The accommodation I prefer is tent .
I haven't tied it before .
I started climbing since I was a child .
About the Basketball , I have been played it for seven years .
Finally , may I ask some more informations .
What kinds of clothes shall I take ?
how about the weather there ?
Would you give me some pocket - money during the trip .
Also , may I take a friend with me , how much will she pay ?
As I was asked , I spoke to a number of students about their opinions of this short video .
I found that most of them had suggested that four lessons should be filmed which as follow :
1 . Grammer , which is the base of learning English .
Speaking , it makes you more confident when you talk with other peoper .
Let you do more pratices .
Listening , it really helpful for improving your listening and understanding .
Writing , this lesson techer you how to organise what you want to write .
Also , there are two activities should be filmed .
Students are talking to each other when they are having break .
It is important to pratise your English after lessons .
2 . Teacher are helping students with their problems .
If you have problem on studing , asking teachers is the best way .
It must show the daily lifes of the English students at the school .
In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or log cabin , and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please .
Because last time I was in a tent , I found it really uncomfortable and when it rained in the night I could n't got to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent .
Yours sincerly
But it might not be the same everytime .
So buying things neccessary is fine I think .
But buying things that do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time , but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them , you might regret buying them .
But after you never eat them and just bin them .
I think buying things needed and planned could be enjoyable but buying things you do n't need or unplanned , might make you feel sad after sometime .
It would be a pleasure to us and to your husband to come at the party .
We would like you to come and if you can to help us in an important decision .
He must not learn about it subsequently you must not tell him .
Secondly , the party will take place on Tuesday 16th of June at College Canteen .
We think the suitable time will be 3 - 6 p.m. You can come earlier , if you want .
We would have junky food , some juices and drinks .
Moreover , will come some teacher , of course all the students and the Principal .
On the other hand , we do not know what to give him as a present .
We want something that it would like him or would be necessary .
Please try to come and help us to this problem .
We ar looking forward to your reply .
John said he had some good news to tell me . I am waiting him to come .
Suddenly the bell rings .
I thought that would be John and was he .
We had finished the exams two weeks ago and we were waiting for the results .
The first good new was that we both had passed the exams .
It was a wonderful new .
Then we thought about going for swimming to discuss about some things .
The second new was that he had found a job for the summer .
He would earn a lot of money , in addition they wanted an another person .
As a result I had a work too .
We would have much money from the work .
We imagine that would be the best holidays in our life .
I am writing in reply to your letter in wich you told me I won the first prize .
If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation , because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area .
It would be very pleasant if I could join your basketball team , since I used to play it in my school 's team and I think I 'm pretty good at it .
I 'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take , if it 's cold or hot by this time of the year and if I should bring any money .
I have butterflies of excitement and I'am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken , with a lot of bills to pay .
Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center ?
Its normal to have spending sprees .
Everyone had or will have one while shopping .
Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience .
It 's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves .
If you are a good observer , it 's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date .
On the other hand , if you think that you 'll be on the red , I 'd better stay at home .
My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show ' Over the rainbow ' to the Circle theatre .
Firstly I want to tell you how disappointing was that night .
Everything in the advertisement for the show was wrong .
There were not discounts available for the tickets and the theatre 's restaurant was closed after the show because it was too late .
So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasent night .
So in very few days all the College knew that me and my friends were who had crashed headmaster 's car .
The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to close him in a little house , we had twenty kilometers far from the village until we could change his opinion .
Marc , one of my friends , hit Mr. Heyman with a bottle and he lost his conscience .
When he woke up he started shouting and we had to make him calm .
We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell this anybody because if he does we will hang the photos all arround the village .
He accepted and we left him free .
Everything began because he is a nasty person and he forced us to clean the college every day , for not paying a cleaning assistant .
We need to do something like that to make him change .
I am very glad I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel only in July , because in June I have to study at school which hasn't finished until the end of June .
In August , I have already made another appointment with my friends .
We are going to visit the places of interest of China , as usual , our new term begins in September .
I only can travel in July
Accommodation I would prefer in tents to in log cabins .
Tents are very easy to take and go everywhere .
What 's more , in my opinion it is very romantic .
I like taking photograph , in my only room .
There are all kinds of photos , for example , beach , sea trees and so on .
In the end , I wonder what kind of clothes I should take and how much money I should bring with me .
Instruction :
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons be filmed into a short video .
The majority of them said it 's a good idea to make something about Maths and English study skills .
Sixty percent recommended that the activity which called make the brain up in the morning class should be filmed .
Ten of them said should make the computing .
Two thirds said we should film a part of playing football .
Although Maths is very boring , it is very important in nowadays .
English is the most popular language in the world , what 's more , more and more people start to learn English .
The activity of making brain up can help us remember new words .
Playing football is good for health .
It is recommended that should be filmed about Maths , English study skills , make brain up and a part of playing football .
When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when I had to pay the most expensive price .
I went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15 !
At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late !
All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent in the musical .
While Pat was talking she remembered playing with her dolls and spending a good time with them .
In the following edition the headline was : " Why a teenager sleeps with a toy called Max ? " Everybody laughted at her .
Two weeks later everybody forbade about Marion 's secret and she took into account her relationship with Pat .
I would like to travel only in July because I will take some hollydays at this time .
I prefer to stay in log cabins than in tentes , because log cabins has much esctructure , that I need to stay for a few days .
I can play well basketball , because I use to practice basketball , when I go to the club every Saturday .
I will use some photographs to put in one website , that belongs of one magazine , that I had projected .
How much money would like to pay me for five hours a day in two weeks working with children ?
2 Most part of students are very shy when the teachers ask them if they have one doubt in some subjects at the classes .
The students at school shoudn't be shy , because they have estercotipie inside in some issues , that confuses them the means of things .
3 When you are ready to shopp , some times you know before what is your priority to buy , because probaly you need one thing than others .
But the best thing that we do , when we make shopp is spend the time having lunch at snack bar , watching cinema and play games computer .
Last month , I work like roadie at Rolling Stones Pop Concert , I was responsable of sound that comes from the stage .
Now , I have some experience to produce CDs alive of famous band , that would like to do it .
I hope so to be producer of shows , as soon as possible .
I was very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition and it will be a good opportunity for me to go to the U.S.A.
I have chosen photography and climbing for activities .
I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in . I have a medium level in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains .
Can you tell me how much money I have to take , if I have to take winter clothes and if it is possible to rent a car there .
Some people when they are tired relax spleeping , reading a book or watching television but not me .
I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one in this case .
There were always , at the end of the afternoon , some well - dressed women coming from their offices and they just spent one hour in the shop whithout buying anything .
However it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable for example before Christmas or during some special salles .
In these periods of the year , the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a warm and noisy place .
I am writing to you to explain how was my experience in the theatre last Friday .
I did not expect to find all the problems that I had .
Firstly , I would like to say that the actor who played was not the same one that I read in the advertisement .
Secontly , the musical show began fourty - five minutes later and nobody explained me what was happened .
Thirdly , I did not receive any kind of discounts when I payed although in the advertisement it was written .
After the musical show , I went to the theatre restaurant but I could not have had dinner because it was closed .
I think that if the musical show will begin later the restaurant should close later , too !
Finally , from my point of view , I would like to receive the money that I payed because it was not the same as you offered in the advertisement .
I think when you explain a secret you must be sure that you have chose the best person to keep it .
When I was a child my friends were my companions of class and , especially my neighbours .
In the summers I always were playing with them on the street .
I prefered going by motorbike with the people who studyied with me in the Institute .
When you go to the university you are a person who can begin to make a good friends .
You have an experience to know people and now you have an opportunaty to select good friends .
For theses reasons , I think that you should know well the person who wants to explain a secret and keep it .
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring , I booked the ticket imagetly .
But , instead there was a different actor , who I never heard about before !
The show should start at 19.30 , but it did n't start until 20.15 !
In fact , it was closed the whole evening , because of some work .
As I 'm a student , I usually get discounts on different things , so I was so disappointed when I could n't get it here !
I 'm really upset and disappointed after all this and at least I want my money back !
I belong to this generation who had grown up with a lot of different technolgy .
For example TV , telephone , micrown etc .
But the last few years , it has change and so many new important things had been discovered .
What I 'm talking about are the computer , which now can be found in almost every home and of course , the mobile phone !
I tought I would never need a mobile phone , but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now I ca n't live without it !
But the discovery that I 'm most thankful to is the computor and the Internet !
Thanks to it , I can easy communicate with my family and friends at home when I 'm here in England .
To use the mobile phone by the way , is very expensive .
So , I start every day , swiching on my mobile phone , to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e - mail and that 's just the begining of the day ...
First of all , the play started 45 minutes later .
And discounts were not available ( nobody explained the reason ) .
I 'm sure you will complain the reasons why I want my money back .
If you could n't do that , we will accept to go to another play .
But Pat was in the wrong place in the incorrect hour .
That 's a story of a crime of passion .
In few hours everyone knew it .
Pour lovers !
When Jim 's wife knew it she caught a gun and killed her husband .
Then , she cried and cried holding him .
( If she had n't do it , Lorca 's father would had made the same ) .
She jumped into the river and killed herself two days after .
Pat and Jim 's wife lived with the guilty all their long lives .
I am writing in reply to your letter , in order to answer your requests .
Second , I would rather stay in a log cabin , because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places , so a tent would be unapropriate for me .
I haven't played golf for a long time , so it will be pleasent to do so .
Finally , I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me to take .
Yours sincerately ,
It was supposed to start at ten , but when the band was going on stage , the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights !
The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin , while I just stood there trying to see what had happened .
He asked me to help Bono , the leader , get up and to get him some water .
Like an hour later , he recovered and the show began .
I am writing regarding to our visit to the Circle Theatre the 17th June .
When we saw your advertisment for the musical show , over the rainbow , we immediatly decided that this must be a perfect evening out .
There was in our opinion two reasons for that , our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwords .
However the evening become very disappointing .
Firstly , Danny Brook was not acting , there was another unknown actor and he was not good .
Secondly , the show was supposed to start 19.30 , but did not start until 20.15 .
Thirdly , in your advertisment it says that discounts should be available , but it was not .
Above these the restaurant was closed because of water leakage .
I am therefore asking for a compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a sollution as soon as possible .
Yours sincerelly
I had thought about it for many years but never been able to fulfill my dreams .
This year I had the opportunity to make my dreams come through .
However I was n't sure if my decision was right and therefore I decided to discuss it with Pat .
Pat is my best friend , since we first met in primary school .
It is now twenty years ago .
I really like Pat , she 's funny , has a good sence of humor and like me she loves to discuss everything .
So therefore , my choise to ask her about my decision was the best I could do .
She really listen to me and told me that I did the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application for an language course in England .
I wanted to keep this as a secret until I received the answer from the School .
But it is ok , I still like Pat , even though she ca n't keep a secret .
Hello Helen ,
I have recived your exiting letter , informing me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I will answer your questions in this letter begining with the best moment for the Camp .
Because of my study I will not be free to travel until july and schools goes on in August again so I hope July will be fine .
I much prefer sleeping in tents , it seems more friendly and realy sounds like holydays .
Choosing only two activities in such a bunch of interesting ones was quite hard , but I decided to take the two I 've never tried , Climbing and Surfing .
I would like to know what kind of clothes should I bring and wether I can wash it or not , and I 'd like to know how much money will I need for extras ?
Thank you very much
Yours sincerely
Excuse me for the long time I left you without any news .
I wrote you last time that I was going to give a hand for the installation and preparation of " Garbage 's " concert and you asked me to tell you how it has been .
So one week befor the concert I went at " L'Arena " to meet the other worker and receive the instructions .
I 've had the hounour to help their sound engeineer and branch the cables for microphones ggitares etc .
We realy started to work like ants the morning befor the show .
It was exiting looking all three mens working together and building a scene , and it was interresting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configuring his computers to get the best sound possible .
About two hours befor the beginning of the show , we met the band and recieved tickets to backstage , that was wonderful , maybe better than the concert itself !
And the next morning , I was here again to help them folding their stuffs .
That 's a great experienc !
Now Kim , tell me about your side of the show
Yours Andre
I am writing in reply to your letter , which I have received last week , and in fact I am very surprised and please for the prize .
First of all I would like to travel in July because is my free month since I am student and I am very busy during all year .
Secondly , according to accommodation , I would prefer to stay in a long cabin , due to I used to use the tent on holiday and I haven't got very good experiences .
In addition , I work every summer as a Monitor in the leisure centre in my town .
Apart from this photography is one of my favorite hobbies and I usually spent nearly all my spare time practising it and of course I have some diplomas as well .
Lastly I would like to ask you for some questions .
On the one hand I would like to have further information about which kind of clothes I need for that area .
I do n't know if I have to bring only light clothes or both .
On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes , since I need to know how much money I have to take .
Hello it 's been ages since we were in touch , I 'm sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I have been very busy last month , with this job .
I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed a lot and of course I knew a lot of people there .
On the one hand at first I was a little insure about if I was able to do this job , because they needed people with some skills and experience .
After a interview I was chosen for it , I could n't believe it .
I feel that this was a good oportunity for me , not only for my professional but also for my personal life .
Moreover I practised a lot of aspect of my speciality , for me was the most important real experience .
According to my job , I had to help the teams with the outlights and of course it had been my first proffesional experience : at the end I felt a member of them , because they were so kind to me , and I could colaborated a lot of and I learnt a lot with this project .
Furthermore , I found it very short time and they offered me new project for the summer .
First of all the actor was the same since last semester .
I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis , he is a great actor and he would fit well this musical .
Then I was sitted with my friend just waiting for the start that lasted forever and was supposed to start at 19:30 .
After the show I felt really hungry , so I meant to go to the restaurant which occasionally was closed .
By the time I thought : " I want my money back .
" That was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I 've ever seen .
Attencionally
Once , when we first met I was about 15 and she was the same age , we started talking and by the time we found out a very good friendship on our conversation .
One day she came over to my house and we spoke all night about our lives .
The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I was n't expecting , Pat had told everybody about my first experience in kissing .
People would be starring at me and laughing .
I got really mad at her , but nowadays we are friends , not as close as we used to .
The most suitable time for this trip is only in July , because I 've planned already the rest of my summer holidays .
On June and August , so that 's the only time when I can travel there .
An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins .
I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there , but I ca n't have it in tent .
I 've also choosed two activities , swimming and sailing .
These are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water , but I like them more than surfing .
At the end I would like to ask you how much money is needed and what kind of clothes are the best for this camp .
I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop in the center of a big town .
In such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers , what is not enough when a shop is full of people .
That 's a place where you lose too much of time and health .
Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket , because there is smaller crowd and more sellers work there .
In these days people prefere shopping at supermarkets than at shops or even shopping areas , because shopping at shop is less enjoyable and you spent the same amount of money .
I am replying to your letter for the first prize of the competition , that I won and there are a number of thinks I would like to make clear .
I can not travel earlier because I take an examination and I have to study for it .
In addition , I would prefer to have a log cabin , because I am not used to sleeping in a tent , so it would be very difficult for me . at the beginning You state in your last letter that I will have the chance to do two activities .
When I was younger I attend I local basketball team and we became local champions , so I am good at basketball and have a lot of experience .
Finally , there is one think I would like to ask .
As you know , I helped at a pop concert last month . and I must say it was fantastic .
I had to iron them , put them in order , so that the pop stars , who will sing at the concert , look impressive . and handsome .
I had to look after the tone that nothing goes wrong .
That was very responsible but fortunately I had help from other person .
I must say that being in a concert is very nice .
But helping in a concert is much nicer .
At the end I realized that all your need is co - operation and do n't think selfishly .
I was very glad I won the competition .
This trip will , undoubtedly be a wonderful experience .
As far as the dates of travelling are concerned , the only period available would be in July as I am fully booked for the remaining summer .
I would therefore be very thankful if you could book the tickets for then .
Concerning the accommodation choice you have proposed me , please make sure I am sleeping in a tent , as I have never experienced open air camping before .
Concerning the proposed activities please , accept me for Singing and Painting .
Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to carry ?
As you asked me , I write you about my experience at the Pop Concert .
There was no big stress about it .
The problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people .
There were 963 persons in the " Armaggedon " that night !
You must show a great sence of responsibility .
But , Kim , can you see an other way to meet the " New Bentley " for free , talk to them and even get paid ?
That was my best day ever , the one I shared a meal with Paul McPartney .
I 'm sure you are jalous now .
Do n't worry they still organise these " youth work " programs .
Dear Sir / Madam !
Now I study and I 'll continue my study untill the end of June .
Then I 'll have holiday which finish in August .
I prefer to live in log cabin because I think it 's more comfortable .
There are warmer and drier and I 'm afraid of insects and spiders .
It 's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest time , because I enjoy swimming and it does n't matter where in the lake or swimming - pool .
I think it 's very usefull and helpful thing for my health especially when I do it with pleasure .
The second my favorit sport is tennis .
I 've played tennis for ten years I 'm a profesional and I have to be good at it , in any time .
How much money I need and if I have to have them in cash or I can use a credit card .
Would you send me your answer as fast as it possible .
How are you ? I 'm fine soon I 'll have my holiday and I look forward for them but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot .
Now I want to tell you about a pop concert as you have already knowen I helped my father to organize this concert .
Sometimes I gave some advices about suits and dresses .
Often we looked repetitions and if something did n't like us we tried to correct it .
The most enjoable thing was to smart people .
We have a good and rich sponsor , that 's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they did n't want to wear that part of cloth which we thought was more similar to their style .
We always explained them and at the end they agreed with us .
But when we saw our show and heard how loud audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time . You should try it and feel .
I am very happy to be the winner of the competition and I am looking forward to come to Camp California .
From August , in fact , I will start with a new job and I will not be able to live Rome for a long period .
I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do so .
So , I have decided to chose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them .
Please let me know how is the climate like at the Camp , so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes .
It would be also useful for me to know if there will be some extra expenses , in order to take enough money for two weeks .
It is a really great pleasure going in and out from different shops , try on a variety of clothes and shoes , and finally go back home with dozens of bags in your hands .
However , there are a few moments in which you can not enjoy shopping .
You can not try on a dress and decide to buy it or not in peace , because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn .
In many cases , you do not even find the things you want , because shops run out of products very quickly .
Moreover , during this period , prices are usually much higher than in the other month 's .
Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable , is when you go shopping with a man .
A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes .
I 'm writing back to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me .
If it 's possible I would like to travel on July because of my job .
I ca n't leave it until this month and I 'm not able to travel at any other time of the year .
As I see I have the chance to choose what accommodation I prefer .
I would like to stay in a tent because I 'm used to go camping at weekends but if there 's any problem I could be very confortable in a log cabin too .
It 's incredible the large list of interesting activities that you offer .
It 's difficult just to try two but if I have the chance I would like to practice sailing and photography .
I have never done noon of them before and as a result I ca n't be good but I 've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunitie .
I also think that it would be great to learn photography because it will give me the chance to go sightseeing and find wonderful places to take pictures .
If you do n't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are apropriate for the camp and for the weather of California .
And also may I have to bring money ? because I know that all the costs are paid but it could be necessary for other things .
I look forward to hear from you .
From my point of view a lot of people believe that it 's very fun to go shopping and it 's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that 's true but in my opinion go shopping can be stressing and disgusting .
First of all we usually go to the shops at the same time than the rest of the world and that 's a little bit complicated because the shops are fulled and it 's impossible to try acurately .
Secondly you have to thank before you come in a shop if you 're going to have luck .
I mean that you have to wait until the seller came to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy .
Thirdly you have to pray to find the right size and once you 've got it you have to think Does it fits me ?
And after all of this it 's important when you 're going shopping to have a big amount of money or you will end stressed , disgusted , and depressed .
At last but not at least let me give you some advice try not to go with that friend of yours that is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that will be awful .
I have just received it yesterday .
I am very exciting .
It is the only month that I can have my holiday in a year and it would be nice in the summer time .
About the accommodation at Camp California , I prefer a log cabin .
It would be nice and safe for me than the tents .
The activities I would like to choose the swimming and sailing .
It could be fun for me because I like swimming and sailing could be exciting too .
Then I can prepare my clothes , or can we buy some clothes there ?
Are they accept the credit card or only cash .
I would be greatful if you could send me the full details .
In the following paragraps I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages about shopping .
Everyone needs to shopping everyday .
It is very important thing for our life .
We need food , clothes , book etc .
There are many kinds of thing for shopping and they are different for example the price , the quality
In suppermarket , shop , department store have many things .
We could buy mostly all we need in one store .
It is very convenien .
Sometime , it 's so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are hurry while you are in the long queu .
We have seen then , shopping is very important for our life .
Most people enjoy shopping because it more convenien for today but if you found the busy place for shopping or it is not as good as you expect .
It would not enjoyable for you .
Dear Sir or Madam , With reference to your advertisment regarding the musical show " Over the rainbow " I am writing to with the intention to give you an impression of our experiences visiting the above mentioned show . We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters .
According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30 .
What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given ; not even an apologation .
We had been told that discounts to the ticket - prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered .
After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant which was - to our surprise - closed because of the time delay !
We would like to ask you if there is any chance to get our money back of or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience ?

A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught .
I 'm just finish reading the letter from you about won first prize in your competition two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. You had ask me some further information .
I would like to travel on the July only Because I 'll be free for the whole month .
So any date on the July .
I 'd like to accommodation at Camp California in tents . Because i like to sleep in tent when i go camping . Also I would like to choose the two activities that you had gave me on the list .
I 'm good in swimming .
But I never do photography before .
I love to take a photo but never have chance to do so .
But I have chance to choose .
Do I have to bring a lots of money ?
What about the clothes do I have to bring a lot ?
That is all i want to know .
Your sincerely
You had ask me a question about my experience helping at a pop concert .
You wanted me to tell you about it right ?
Well , it quite fun while i helping them to do the stuff before the concert gon na start .
I have to get everythings that they need up to the stair .
It 's so tried .
Then after that I have to help them carry all the clothes for the singer to wear from the bus down in to the stuff room .
I saw Westlife too you know they are so cute .
Then I can take rest about 30 mins .
After that i have to go in to the stuff room again because they wanted me to go and buy some drink for the singer .
After i came back i have to help them clean all the make up stuff .
The concert begin ... that mean i can take rest until the concert finish .
After the concert had finish i have to help them again to clean all the stuff . the carry everythings that I can carry back to the bus .
We were so tried but it 's good fun . I think this experience was quite interesting .
If somebody ask me to go and help again I would like to go for sure .
That 's all i did in the pop concert for my experience .
Do n't forget to tell me about yours okay ... Better go to sleep now .
I am writing to appriciate for the good programme .
It was so kind of you to have organised the programme . I would enjoy to see the show , especially a fashion show .
This show starts on Tuesday in Central Exhibition of London from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM .
Especially , students are free !
It will be great opportunity for me .
I feel that it is such a nice experience and worthy .
I would like to suggest idea and change sightseeing by bus on Monday , because the English weather is so changeable .
If it rains , we will not be pleasant .
Some of friends would like to go to the British Museum and I have not been there before .
I would like to recommend ' The Old Man and The Sea ' because I 've read it when I was teenager .
Last week I was on holiday at London and I was very dissappointed when I visited your theatre .
First of all the show was supposed to start at 19.30 , but it was delayed untill 20.15 , and when the show finally began we were supriced to see that Danny Brook who was the star of the show , was not playing and someone else had replace him and he was really disappointing .
Moreover , the advertisement says that discounts will be available with the price of the ticket , but when I asked for one they told me that there was not any .
Last but not least , the advertisement says to visit your restaurant after the show , but when we went to the restaurant we realised that it was closed because the cook was ill .
it was a complete waste of time and money .
That is why I would like to request full refund of my money .
Anna told her again : " Pat do n't tell it to anyone please , especially to my brother everything will be ruin then " . and Pat answered : " Do n't wory I wo n't tell anyone " .
The big secret was that Anna was prearing a suprice party for her brother , John and she did n't want anyone to know about it .
She had told it to Pat though and that was extremely dangerous !
Anna could n't do anything though because she needed her help to give the invitations .
The party was set up to be in two days .
The two days passed really fast and Anna was happy because Pat had n't told anything to her brother , or so she thought !
- " Anna I have a confession to make " Pat told her and she started crying
- " I 've told your brother about the party . I could n't help it ! , I 'm so sorry ! "
Everything were destroyed the party and their friendship .
Thank you for your lovely letter ?
I was really surprise to heared I have won in your competition .
With pleasure I 'll give all information wich you need .
I would like to book my tickets from the beginning of July .
The 3rd of July will suit to me .
As far as I know accomodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins .
It 's more convinient for me .
I am very glad I can chose two activities while I will at the Camp .
I am keen on basketball , I played in my country for 7 years .
I am good diffender .
I would like to choose surfing like my second activities .
I 've seen how people do it but I 've never tried it my own .
I 'd like to know what temperature in July in California and you re advice about how much money I will need to have an unforgetable hollydays !
Yours sincerely
Is shopping not always enjoyable , is it ?
We ca n't say that is always enjoyable or is not .
I think that good shopping depends on ourself .
If we decided to by somthing special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it .
Some times we have to have deal with not good service or for example could you imagine it on your way to shop you have met wrong people or someone told you bad news .
Or quality of your new thing is not so good that you really expected .
Situations are variously .
Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to night - club but you are short of money .
Some people will do crazy things in situation like this .
But I want to wish you have a good enjoyable shopping all your way .
During my prior holiday in London I came across an encourageing advertisment for the show and decided to see it .
Unfortunately , I was very dissappointed to find out that there were no discounts available !
In addition , I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisment .
My dissatisfaction became even bigger when I had realize that there had been a different actor than Danny Brook performing !
Moreover , I was unable to use the theatre restaurant as it had been closed due to redecoration !
I feel as if I had been lied to and thus I demand my money to be returned .
Everyone had already heard of me getting the secret access code for the ' Secret Society ' organisation .
This was the kind of association everybody knew of but nobody talked about .
Everyone was aware that telling aloud about ' Secret Society ' could get you in trouble , serious trouble .
I 've always enjoyed the hazard and this time getting the password was , indeed , a tough coockie .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wether to use it or not .
Especially now , when ' big - mouth ' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone . I would n't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me .
I am writing to you because I am very glad for my first place in the competition , I am going to tell you the things that you ask me on your letter .
I would like to travel on July because is the perfect time to go to the camp and is summer .
Accommodation at camp I would like to choose cabins because I think I would be protected from the animals and the cold .
Furthermore for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I haves been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college like the capitan .
I want to ask you one more thing I do not have any idea about how much money and clothes I have to bring would you give me an advice to know how much I need to bring
I look forward to heard from you
I 'm writing to you to tell you about my experience when I was helping at a pop concert , well first let me tell you that my job was helping the artist if they need something , for example give them water or snacks .
It was n't very exciting job but you can knew a lot of pop Artists that was the good thing because they gave their t - shirts also I could chat with them for a few minutes .
another good thing was that all the people wants to be in your place and they were very jealous about me .
any way , this was my own experience working at the concert , if you have any oportunity to help at any concert you should help because you have a lot of fun as well ok .
I am writing to you in replay to the letter I have recently recived , to inform you about some details that I am concerned about .
First of all I want you to know that I would prefer to travel in July due to the exam I will be taking in June and , afterwards , I will start my university studies in September which means lots of things to be sorted out .
Secondly , I prefer staying in log cabins because it is easyer for me to keep my personal belongings clean and tidy apart from the fact that I am terribly afraid of insects such as spiders and ants .
In your letter you settled the possibility to choose two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join to basketball and climbing , as I am very good at both of them due to I 've played in my secondary scholl as leader of my team and due to my long training periods in lifting weights .
Lastly , do I need to take with me any special staff of clothes ?
Do I need some money ? and if it is so , how much ?
Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend , that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on , you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory .
There is as well the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds crambled in the small shops during the unique day - off you have to buy somthing you like .
All this can easily leads to a nerve - collapse , particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay .
If this was n't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when despite having been stolen , having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and after having walked a few blocks you see the same item at half price in another shop .
I 'm the winner of the first prize in your competion and I 'm writing to you to give some information which was required for you .
Well , it 's only possible in July because of the University 's holiday ( during the rest of the year I 'm attending to the classes ) .
If I can choose accommodation I prefer log cabins , because when I 've been in Camps , it always has been in tents , then I 'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation .
It 's really difficult choose two activities from that list .
Everyone are very interesting .
Anyway , I think Basketball could be the right because it 's the sport that I 'm practising from I was a child and photography because it 's my hobby on my free time , I 'm really enjoy it and I can say I 'm so good in it .
I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and what about money and meals , Are they provided ? or can we find some places to buy it ?
I suppose it 's everything that you need from me .
Any other question do n't hesitate to ask me .
Yours faithfully ,
I think shopping is a subject really up to date .
I can say that nowadays is growing up very quickly in our society like a kind of sport or hobby to waste or spend the free time .
And it 's creating a lot of adict people , call " shopalcoholics " .
Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable . You can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were looking for , perhaps because it is not your size or the colour that you like , or just nothing is suitable to you .
Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms waiting stand up for your turn .
After that , the unfriendly and sometime 's unpolite shop assistance who breaks your nerves down .
the worst arrive when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit because your feet are killing you and realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight .
Or to whom it main concern :
I am writting to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre .
Well I seems to me that you should know what had happened there .
First of all , I read your advertisement where it was written that the musical show started at 19.30 , but do you know at what hour it started ?
Do n't you think it is a lack of respect ?
Really it was .
I forgot to tell you that there were no available discounts .
And tickets were too expensive !
As a matter of fact , when the musical show was over , I was really hungry .
But can you believed it , it was closed .
Absolutely closed .
This really disappoint me .
Well I think that is all , but I will ask you to give my money back .
Looking forward hearing from you .
Well first of all Pat was a very friend of mine .
He was really a good friend , until something had happened .
With nothing to lose , at all , but on the contrary , with a lot to learn from .
I was very keen on English lessons , maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loves .
He was a very handsome and good looking boy .
But far from that , he was a very kind person .
He told me that it was nessary to do something about .
Pat suggested me to talk to him .
But I really did n't managed to do so .
As Pat was lossing his patience , he decided to talk to him .
I can say that I was very nervious or anxious about what was going to happen .
He did n't kept my secret .
But so , I think it was for the best , he was also in love with me .
But on the other hand I will never trust in Pat .
Dear Madame ,
I am writting this letter to informe you about the decisions I have made according to your questions .
First of all I would like to travel on July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June .
I will not be able to travel on August because I have found a job for that month .
Secondly I would prefer to be accommodate in log cabins .
When I was a child I was affraid of all these little insects that they live in the ground and this fear still remain till now .
I also think that the log cabin will be much more confortable than the tent .
asketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen .
I play basketball since I was twelve years old and I am member of the basketball school team for four years .
In swimming I had won the first price of a local competition .
Finaly I would like to ask you for some further informations about the clothes and the money we will need .
Yours sincerely
It was a very excited experience and I really enjoyed very much .
I did n't have to do something very difficult .
I was only responsable for the property of the back stages .
But if anyone was been asking for some help I was always there .
The most exciting about this experience was to meet all these well - known people .
I was shocked and terrified the firt time I saw them , but the truth is that they are men like us .
They have a very simple life and behavior when they were n't on the scene
I am writing to complain about the problems were exist on the musical show .
First of all you said that the starring would be Danny Brook but there was not .
After that , the time that the show should start was 19:30 but it started fortyfive minutes later .
People have been started to complain .
What about the available discounts . They were not exist .
Except of this there more .
After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed , because the chef of the restaurant was ill .
You have to excuse me but this was a very disappointing evening .
I would like to return to me my money back .
I am waiting your answer as soon as possible .
One day Brian , the best friend of Pat told him a secret .
An important secret for Brian .
He told him , that he was in love with Jane , a girl in their class .
Pat told this secret to Beth the best friend of Jane .
He did n't told the secret because he wanted to heard Brian but because he wanted to help him .
Brian was very shame to ask Jane in date .
So , Beth , asked Jane if she is in love with Brian and she said that she was .
When Pat heart the good news he told to Brian to asked her in date and he knew that she will accepted .
Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him .
This was another disappointing thing of that evening .
But my complain does not finish here .
It was of my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets , as the advertisement showed , but there were no discounts .
Definetely , it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back .
She was the director of the school newspaper and Mary did n't tell her it was a secret , so on monday at 9 a.m. MY SECRET was published in the school paper and at the end of the day , eventually everybody had read the " news " .
But I soon knew it because when I went to the school canteen everybody was staring at me and whispering to eachother .
At first I did n't realise what was happening , but then a friend of mine told me that everyone knew that I was going out with the most popular boy in the school and that we had kissed eachother in the park last friday .
I recived your letter about I won two weeks at camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like travel July because I will have holidays in this mounth .
About the accommodation at camp , I prefer in tents because I love sleep in tents , is more interesting than sleep in log cabins .
I would like do climbing and sailing while I 'm at the camp , I can climbing very well I used to climbing ten years ago in my country .
I 'm worried about what kind of clothes I will need in the camp ? and how much money I have to carry for the trip ?
Could you answer my questions please as soon as you can , because I 'm nervous , and I need your soon answer , and I will have talk with my parents about camp .
I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable .
Nowadays , the people are always buying anythings maybe they do n't need this things , only buy because is in fashion .
In the first place , when the people think only in go to the shopping forgot others things : play with their children , talk with than parents , friends .
In the other hands , when the people go to shopping spend a lot of money .
I my view , is more enjoyable do others things than go to shopping because , maybe " you lose your money " .
Dear madame
I 'm happy to answer to your questions .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because my boss wo n't let me free in August .
Secondly , I would like to stay in tents because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can .
Regarding to the activities , I choose swimming and tennis .
I 'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian See .
I do n't think I 'll have the chance of doing it again in the future .
On the contrary , I 'm an absolute beginner in playing tennis and I 'm not fit in running but I chose it because it is a sport I 've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time .
Should I bring cash or a credit card is all I will need ?
I ca n't ? look forward to start this adventure .
Yours sincerily
I 'm a woman and they say that shopping is women 's best activity .
In fact I ca n't buy whatever I like and I ca n't follow fashions just like the other women do .
When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra - large size and harder to find it .
I see a lot of pretty things but I have to quit the idea of wearing them just because I think that they wo n't look so pretty on me .
And if this is a problem to me , imagine how bad a very fat woman ( or man ) should feel .
Often they must go in special shops to by their clothes .
First of all , the reason that we decided to do this party was because Mr Brown helped to the organisation of our trip to France .
And we preciate to not tell him about our party .
Secondly , the party it is on Tuesday 16th pm at the College Canteen .
As concerned the food , our mothers they will help about that .
Also , the drinks we will take them from our canteen and there will be a group of mucisians for our entertainment .
Moreover , at the party they will be come of course all the class , our teachers and the Principal at our school .
We should buy a book or a Cd player .
I hope that to have been of some help you about the party .
It was Friday morning when I saw John and said me he had some good news to tell me .
And it was real good news .
He also tell that I must be the next day at 7:00 p.m. in the company .
All the night I did not sleeping at all .
I was draw 6:30 p.m in the company .
The executive calls me on the office , and he has show me my office .
From , that day , every day I was gone to the office 30 minutes before .
When I complete a month to this job my executive he tell to John to go to the office .
I was surpised because I did not know what he wanted .
When I went his wants to tell me that from the next month I will be his personal secratary and my salary it will be the double how the previous .
I can not believe it .
Now , my life it is in the best way it would be thought about .
And every day when I wake up I think that I live in the dream which I never want to finish .
Sir manager of the theatre ,
I recently had a week 's holiday in London and went to see a musical show in your theatre .
With a friend we had seen your advertisement for the show , witch was very attractive .
Unfortunatly , the musical show did n't go like the advertisement explained , and that wise I wo nt ask you some money back .
The starring had been changed , the show had started only at 20:15 , and there were no discounts available .
Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside .
And your last phrasal of the advertisement " Your perfect evening out " ! it was n't at all , like I have explain you above in this letter .
I thank you in advance an hope for a positive requiere .
At the began of my work in a Insurance Company , I had only a old writting machine , witch makes a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with it because the switch were hard for my small fingers .
Now I have a new computer , witch is very easy to use , and confortable for my fingers also more farrster .
But wen the computer do n't work , I got a big problem to do my work .
Also now for write a letter to a friend overland it is better with Internet .
It is so practical , in five minuts my friend can read my letter .
And he can ansewer me very quickly .
I think , it is now the futur for the big company for work with the Internet .
Dear Helen .
Here are the information which you asked me for .
I would like to travel in July , because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days .
Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July .
I 'd prefer to say in log cabins . Because our family had some bad experiences with using tents .
But Golf is an absolute new trial .
I can imagine myself playing Golf in those beautiful Californian golf - courses .
Especially I wonder what else I have to pack to go there . Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes , and also if it is necessary to bring some money for me .
How are you ? I wish you are fine .
I 'm fine either but I 'm quite busy to find another part time job after the one , which was the concert supporting one .
It was quite terrible when I had to let people leave , because all tickets were sold out .
Then the concert started , I was called from one of the staffs for help , finally I could get into the stadium .
The next work I was gives was ironing costumes .
It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works , which I was mostly interested .
But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience 's reactions , meanwhile the backstage could n't even join that fantastic atmosphere .
And that mad the concert absolutely perfect .
I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together .
Dear Sir / Madam .
I am writting to inform some problems we had .
I want to the theatre to see " over the rainbow " at 17th June .
First of all , we went to ticket office to get the tickets . I thought we can buy discounts tickets according to the advertisement .
However , we could n't buy them the price . eventually , we got the tickets , Because we would like to see the musical and Danny Brook .
After we arrive at the theatre , We were very disappointed .
Because the different actor played the musical that day .
In addition , It started 20:15 .
We had to wait over 40 minitues .
and we could n't enjoy dinner at theatre restaurant after the show .
I think if the musical start late time , you should open the restaurant until late time .
Would it be possible for me to back money for tickets .
I am looking forward to hearing you .
After we finish school , we usually gathered the place .
Where do you think ?
There was beach our town .
it was old and little broken .
But it was most important place in the world .
We always played there and it was adventure for us .
One day , Suddenly , heavy storm came our town .
I went to the sea to see our ship .
My friends had come there , too .
We worried about it and we tryed to pull it .
It seemed to sank into the sea , but fourtunately , storm went soon .
Our ship left on the beach .
And our parents and teachers , too .
Because Pat called them .
But now , I am thinking about new secret our place .
Where do you think ?
I have recently been on a holiday in London .
Secondly I also would like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15 .
Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor .
Very disappointing as Danny Brook is my favourite actor .
We saw the musical in sadness .
Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner .
To our surprise the restaurant was closed because the lack of staff to keep it open .
I hope to receive the payment as soon as possible .
Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that .
I gave it a thought the other day and when I think about future - clothing I ca n't take my mind from plastic - fabrics .
I mean when the earth 's getting warmer and warmer because of an pollution that we people cause the world .
Maybe in the future they 'll find out a new fabric which protects you from dirt and dangerous sunshine .
Strict suits will be transformed into a school - uniform - like shirt and knee - lengthed shorts .
Anyway we defenately now that they 're going to change .
If we live long enough we 'll be able to find out , so keep living !
Last weekend , I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show " over the Rainbow " .
I write this letter to you for explain my very bad evening I have passed in theatre .
On the paper it was writting the principal actor is " Danny Brook " but it was n't him , it was a different actor that we have never seen , and heard .
I think it 's really not correct .
They haven't respect the timetable , the show had to begun at 19:30 and he started at 20:15 how can you explain this fault ? !
But it 's not finish you wrote on the paper " Discounts available " but it was n't true , it was a very badly organisation .
After this bad show we had want to go to the Restaurant for drunk and ate something and it was closed and nobody had explained us why the Restaurant was n't open .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , this sentance is very popular in our school .
Pat is not an angry girl .
Last year , on a Saturday evening my boyfriend phone me at 20 h o'clock and said me , " Would you like to go to the cinema with me " I asked my parents but the said me " No you ca n't go to the cinema , tomorrow you have school .
Then I phone to Pat for explain my big problem .
Pat said to me " You said to your parents that you sleep by me and you do n't go to the cinema .
I asked my parents and they said alright you can go to Pat for sleeping .
I was very happy , I phone to my boyfriend and I explained him my secret he said allright so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema " .
I passed a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema , but on Sunday my mother phone Pat 's mother and Pat 's mother explain all the story to my mother .
If Pat haden't say the secret to her mother I would be have no problem .
Since this Saturday evening I had never speaking with Pat .
Firstly , I would like to travel Camp California on Monday , 6th July , because my school 's holiday will begin at the end of June .
Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing , because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming .
However , I have never tried to go surfing .
I would be appreciated it if you supply some towers , if possible .
It took place in a Korea national center which was the biggest building in Korea .
I helped to guide foreginers who would like to take participated in that .
That 's why I could attend to that concert as a volunteer , because they needed people who could speak English very well .
I got Madona 's signature !
Tuesday 13th june
Dear Madame ,
thank you for your letter , I 've been so happy to receave such a good news that I ca n't already believe it .
To answer your first question , I would like to travel on july if it 's possible , because I 'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at this time of the year .
In the accomodation at Camp California , I prefer to rent a tent , he is going to be more funny , I think , but are the tents singles ?
I can see in the list a lot of interesting sports !
But I think ( it 's difficult to choose ) I 'll choose golf and basketball , golf because I 'm quiet good .
I finished 5th at the England Golf tour junior in 1999 , and basketball , because I would like to discover this sport I only used to play at school .
I 've got other questions : wich type of clothes do I have to bring ?
Can I change money on the campus ?
Are some party organized during the holidays ?
Is there only one teatcher for each sport , and how many are we in each group of activities ?
Thank you for all informations you could give me .
I look forward to hear from you .
First , I think we ca n't shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks , because this two elements are representative of a daily life at school are n't they ?
First , we should film some lessons because everybody know ( or remember for the growns up ) that it is the activity that to be the most of a student time at school .
Just after , to make a contrast , we may film the break , because it 's the other part of a daily school !
It 's the place where you can meet your friends , where you can talk free , there are no teatchers , it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons .
To come back to a strict ( a little beat less ) subject , I suggest that we film the sport lesson , doing that will allowed the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups .
Finally we should film the lunch , which is also a moment to relax for the students , and for the teatchers , we must n't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students , it 's also made of teatchers .
I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competiton of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
This august I will start a new job so the only possible month for me to join in the Camp is July . I hope this will cause no problems .
I am glad that you offer for accommodation not only tents but also log cabins .
Although it was not easy to choose two activities from your list I decided to do Singing and Surfing .
It is difficult to say how good I can sing but I really like it and I think I am not too bad .
I never did Surfing in my life but I am a very good Snowboarder and this could be an advantage .
I hope I gave you all informations you need .
There is something I like to know from you .
How much money do you think I have to change and is there a possible to get more ( bank ) ?
Last saturday evening I spent a wonderful time .
The motor bike club of our town organized a pop concert .
The only thing I had to do was solving the different problems of the guests and just being there if they have any questions .
Some people came from Germany some from Austria and some came from England or the U.S.A.
That I reached a lot of money for doing something I like very much was very nice but the most important thing for me was meeting people , having fun and using the English language .
Dear Sirs !
First I want to thank you for all the congratulations , and I 'll try to answer all your questions about for instance travel and accomodation . I have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July ( because her small children are in summer school at this time .
I have to tell you that I 'd prefer tents .
For me tents are a kind of back to basic living and I like this very much .
I 'm also used to sing in front of a large number of people ' couse I did it several times .
I 'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professional .
First How much money do I have to take with me ? and what clothes should I choose ?
I 'd be very happy if you could give me a call and answer this questions .
Yours sincerely
Last month I received a letter which told me that I 've entered a competition .
I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it .
My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert .
The pop group which was going to act is called " Metallica " and I like their music very much ( 'cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to . )
I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am .
First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm .
I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything .
At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists .
They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice .
At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you , they did a great performance .
When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance ! or How do you think about the first group ?
You know what I mean , they were not conceited or something like this .
They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much .
This was one of the best and most exciting days in my life .
Firstly , I would be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August .
Secondly , for the accomodation , I would say I prefer living in tent rather than in log cabin because I used to sleep in tent while I was joining a local scout camp in my country .
Thirdly , I have choosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them .
Finally , I would ask you whether I have to prepare any speacial clothes for camping or the camp will provide them for me .
I look forward to receiving the details of travelling soon and joining your camp in July .
In my opinion , I do agree with this expression .
One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping .
I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section .
It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but also decrease the money in my pocket .
Sometime shopping does n't give anything to you but always waste all your free time .
A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever .
It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside .
Keeping balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air - conditioned shopping complex .
Dear Mz .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased that I won the first prize in your compition .
Firstly , I would like to go to California in June if his is possible because I will have finished my course in Merton college at the end of June .
Secondly , I would prefer to staying in a tent rather than staying in a log cabin in order to have experience , which I haven't had before .
I am very knee on swimming and playing tennis so that I have had a part - time job in a sports centre in the evenings .
In addition to all this , I would appriciate it if you could let me have more details about clothes and how much I shall be paid for the travel .
The aim of this report is to describe our English classes in Merton College and suggest that what we should film for making a short video .
It is suggested that speaking classes should be filmed the reason why is that the more students tend to attend .
Another reason is that it will be more useful for forigen students who want to speak English .
A number of forigen students have recently been increasing .
It is also thought that school trips are to be filmed because it is a wide range of interesting places available .
It is believed that one of the most popular activities in Merton College .
To sum up , it is recommened that speaking classes and school trips should be filmed .
Misses Helen Ryan ,
First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oportunity to travel .
You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart , the accomodation I would like to have and so on .
Travelling in July , I have to say , would be perfect for me because I have got my birtday the 24th of this month and I wish I could spend my birtday as well as possible , so it means there .
I also would prefer to sleep into tents which are more comfortable and , because I have been doing lots of campings , I am quite used to this kind of accomodation .
The activities I have choosen both represent a pation for me .
Painting and swimming are my way to spend a good time especially on holiday .
I may have a question for you to answer , please could you tell my how much money do I need to bring with me ?
However it is not always enjoyable , people are shopping more and more , it is very fashionable those times .
Even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway .
Is it enjoyable to walk around shops , looking at nice stuff , without having enough money to spend on it ?
Is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time or when it is very hot in summer for instance ?
Enjoying shopping is n't the reason for doing that .
I think people either go shopping to change mind because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people , to feel they belong to a group of human being .
My wife and me went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor , Danny Brook .
I want you to give our money back because the things published in your advertisement are n't true .
It 's been a long time since I last wrote you !
I 'm always very busy traveling from one country to another , you know .
I 'm writing to you now because I 've been told that is going to be read on the radio a short story by Agatha Christie .
It will be the following Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening .
It 's a story titled Accident , and I think you 'll enjoy it .
The story is about the life in a small village .
Drop me a line and let me know what do you make of the story .
We are writting to you to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , we saw last week in your Theatre .
We have spent a week 's holiday in London and wanted to see a musical show .
We read an advertisement about your musical show , starred by the well - known Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in a local newspaper
We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by other at the last minute .
The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30 , but it started actually at 20:15 due to the probleme of the sound .
We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts was n't available for us , because they did n't accept our student indentity card from Switzerland .
We were very frustrated to read on the door of the theatre restaurant " Close due to holidays " specially when we were very starving .
So we asked you for our money back .
I looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Could you figure out how your life will be without all the modern technology ?
What is the effect of it in your environement ?
Were the people happier in a past than to day ?
If you are interested in the question , you will be interested by this article .
Nowadays , the technology takes a large place in your daily life and improves the speed of the achievement .
For example at work , we look on the computer screen all day , sending e - mail at the other side of the world , doing some searches etc .
We gain a lot of time with computer , but if your computer brooks down , you could n't do anything because everything is on it .
The technology moves very fast specially in the domaine of transportation .
The cars are able to reach 300 km per hours speed and are more reliable than in the past .
The major probleme for the industry cities is to deal with the bad effect of polution in the environement .
A lot of money are involved in research to stop the increasing of polution .
To sum up , all the improvements have a price to pay ; The condition of the environement .
We are too reliable at technology today .
But we can ask us " What will be happen in 50 years ? Our children will be able to travel in the moon as we travel to Japan ?
Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was played in your theatre those last weeks I want to explain you some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement and as a result of it , all the problems that I had .
First of all , I think if you go to a play and you are watching to see your favourite actor playing a good play and then appears a silly one , who does n't know what to do , it is disappoint at all .
Secondly , all the spectators were waiting the begining of the play at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 then I would like to know why do you say one time in the advertisement why do you do what you want .
Another thing that I want to know is why you did n't do any discount if it was showed in the advertisement .
Maybe , I could be a good way to get spectators but I 'm going to comunicate that to my travel office .
When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because like on the paper that was on the door was writen , it was too late .
I think , that it was n't my perfect evening out so I wait to be payed back .
All started when she was fifteen , when started a new course on the institute and met some girls that passed the time they would became her friends .
Three years passed and like is normal between friends , she knew a lot of things about them like her friends knew a lot about her
When it was time to do the final exam , she became ill and she could n't do it so teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks but on the other hand the principal desagreeded with it and did n't give the permision to pass her .
She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and like is usuall girls from the last course became popular .
Pat , to win her new classemates ' friendship tell all what she knew about her friends and owing to what Pat said , her friends broke they friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged .
Pat 's classmates made the same and Pat finished alone .
During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see " Over the rainbow " , the " London 's newest and best musical show . " I have to admit that was my great mistake .
Never before had I such a disappointing evening .
First of all , there was an old , ugly , and unknown actor in the main part instead of brilliant Danny Brook !
To make matters worse , the show started at 20.15 , although the advertisement was saying it would begin at 19.30 .
And on the top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters ' strike , so I had to look for another place to have a snack .
Otherwise I 'll have to apply to court for aid .
On the one hand , science and technology have been developing rapidly , and God knows what new materials will be invented in future .
We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic artificial cloth in 2100 .
Of course , those new material wo n't be so harmful for our health as today 's nylon and other things like that .
On the other hand , people tend to wear natural clothes today , made of cotton , wool .
This tendency may result in turning down synthetics at all .
And it is even more difficul to predict how the clothes of the future will look like .
People 's fantasy is enormous .
I am writing to complain about the musical show which was presented by The Circle Theatre last week .
I saw the performance and it was not like it was mentioned in the advertisent I read in the local newspaper .
First of all , the main actor was not Dany Brook as it was expected so .
Secondly it must have started at 14.30 and ended by 19.30 .
Then , I was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mention in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true , so I just could buy two tickets and my son could not see the show .
Finally , I was thinking to have dinner in the threatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees .
What was suposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening , resulted in a very disappointing time .
So I would be greatful if you payed for a full refund of the money I spent in the tickets .
Computers , radio , CD 's , sattelite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life .
Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects in my life , and it has some advantages as some disadvantages .
What I mean is that computers are very useful to do my homework ( like some monographies or researching ) .
And I ca n't even think about how it would be not having a computer .
Another advatage is that , for example sattelite television , which is an example of modern technology , makes me be informed about what is happening on the whole world .
The best example is the homework I have to do for school , I ca n't manage to do it when I do n't have my computer to help .
In addition to that , technology does n't sometimes let me develop my imagination and creative skills .
To sump up , I ca n't think about how my life would be without technology .
You can guess how an enjoyable surprise receiving your letter was for me .
I am glad to send you the items required .
First of all , I must precise that I can only leave during the month of July owing to the job I obtained for August .
After considering your accomodation offers , I 'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible .
I hope you have no doubt about my taste for camping , however I admit I will appreciate a bit of comfort two weeks long .
Moreover , I must recognize that the activities offered are really attractive so it 's hard to make up my mind .
On the one hand , I own a camera that I often use during leisure times .
Even if the photograph made are modest work , I am really interested in this activity .
Then , as low my level of basketball is , I have enjoyed playing this sport for fun for a long time .
So it will be pleasant for me to practice this activity .
Your letter indicates that the pride includes that some costs are paid .
Nevertheless I would like you to precise what I eventually need for this travel .
Yours faithfully
What obviously appears about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes .
Therefore , the film will manage to be a success if it does n't forget the main times that make our life .
To my mind , the class attending a lesson must be shown at first .
It evoques the reason of our presence here and it is a cliché ; that can not lack .
Next , students during the pause in the yard should be filmed .
It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with the classroom atmosphear but also show how they are as young people .
First of all , the arrive of every students , namely the picture of the school without anybody at first , and then with the crowd of students increasing gradually is typical of its life .
Then , the opposite situation , that is to say the scene of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can make a parallel .
At first , the advertisement said that there were discounts availables , but when I went to buy the tickets there were not any discounts .
On top of everyting , the restaurant which was announced in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged .
You can imagine how dissappointed I felt after that evening , and I am writing to ask you for a further return of part of the money .
I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot , but it has in some things : I work with music and with graphic design too , and computers help me a lot in this things .
In music , before having a computer I could only write my compositions and ' listen ' to them into my mind , because , of course , I haven't got an orchestra to play them , but now I just can record one part , and then another part , and then another one .. and I can get the sound of every instrument controlling it with a keyboard , or even create new sounds .
In graphic design , before having a computer I just could draw , but now I can create pictures pixel by pixel , develop ideas more easily , or take photographs into my computer and transform them or mix them .
But , in other things , I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of living too much : I do more or less the same as I did some years ago : I get up in the morning , go to school , have lunch , study and go out with my friends without being afected by microchips or nuclear energy .
I have happily received your reply letter and I want to thank you for this marvelous prize you have given me .
Now to answer your questions , I can only travel in July because that 's the only period of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks .
I would like a log cabin because I think you should give me a good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in , with no electricity and entertainment .
I would like to play basketball and tennis for you .
Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I 'm reasonably good in it .
At tennis I 'm the best player of my whole school and once , I got to the top 10 of my country in tennis .
I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring ?
Money , how much should I bring .
Well , we also had to carry all the instruments up to the stage and believe me , that was the hardest bit of all .
After helping to do that and many other things , my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day ( the group ) left , they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did , and shoke our hands .
I 'll never wash my hands again .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the problems which were shown at the " Over the Rainbow " musical show .
In the advertisement I read that Danny Brook started in the show but when I got there I realised there was a different actor in his place whose acting was n't good enough .
It started at 20:15 leaving us writing for fourty five minutes .
In the advertisement you write that it 's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening in the show very unpleasant .
As you are the manager of the show , you should try to avoid this sort of problems in future shows . I also ask to return me some of my money for the unpleasant evening I passed at your show .
In the future people will wear clothes made of polyseer and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive .
Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong sunrays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will make damage to the human skin .
Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm in cold winters ' days .
As you can realise I think future 's clothes will be adjusted not on only in fashion and the seasons but in the needs of every on as to protect from the earths pollution as well .
I am writing you in relation to our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March .
First at all , it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting , especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday .
On the other hand , our class has recently read an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which takes place during our visit to London , on Tuesday 14th .
This show is a good opportunity to know the latest fashions in several topics like make up , Hairstyles and leisure and sports wear .
We think that it could be a great chance in order to know British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies .
We would like to know if it could be possible to introduce a little change in our programme .
Our question is : instead of going to the shopping on Tuesday , in the afternoon , could we go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show ?
How will be our future homes ?
The reason of all of this things is the impressionable introduction of the " new technologies " , such as Computers , Internet or WAP technologies .
Of course , this new facilities will be introduced at home .
Now , it is already possible to send our shopping list by the computer , and this opption , in the next years , will become the most common once .
The new technologies probably will produce a considerably revolution in some essencial parts of the house .
For example , we will have got computerizated ovens , microwaves and freezers , or we will probably have got central heating controled through Internet from our office .
Despite all of this facilities , there are some home activities that will remain the same , fortunately .
Who do n't like to prepare a cup of tee with traditional kettles , waiting for the boiling watter ?
We are human beings at least , not " new technological " machines !
And from August on I planed to do some part - time job in order to earn some pocket money .
Firstly , log cabins are more comportable than tents .
Last not least , I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days .
As I had been asked to choose two activities I would like to during my stay at the camp , I chose Golf and singing . I have never played Golf actually , but I would love to try something new .
As for singing , I am very keen on singing as I get lessons in it .
I would like to know whether there is some facilities for washing the Clothes .
Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies to US dollar ?
I ask you to enclose the answer in your reply .
When you think of shopping , it reminds you of going out ( mostly ) with friends , looking for new things like clothes , accesoires etc . and buying them .
It all starts with the search of an appropriate parking - space which can last annoyingly long , especially at weekends .
You can not make a step without " touching " the others .
It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days , when the temperature increases .
But the worst moment comes , if you can not find the thing you were looking for , because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out .
Last week I and my family had a holiday in London .
At the end of a holiday we decided to go to the theatre . I insisted on going to your theatre , to the Circle Theatre , because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London .
That days you presented , , The over the Rainbow " .
how you have written at the advertisement : it is the London 's newest and best musical show .
But I and my family had a very disappointing evening .
Because , at first , at the advertisement was written that in this music show would play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but it was n't so .
Danny Brook did n't play at the performance , there was another unknown actor .
And he played awful , I could n't hear him .
Then at the adverstisement stood that performance begin at 19.30 .
I and my family came to that time and had to wait till 20:15 , because the show started only at that time .
I was very nervious .
What is more you wrote that discounts available , but it was also lie .
After the show I was very disappointed , because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure .
He suggested to have a supper in your theatre restaurant .
But when we came to it , we saw that the restaurant was closed , because it was reconstructed .
But why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement , if it is closed ?
So this evening was terriable .
It broke all my impression about London .
And now I requere my money back .
Because of nothing what was mentioned at the advertisement I did n't get .
There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world , which appear not long ago .
Among them a mobile telephone , computers , telefaxes , different mashiens for kitchen , mashiens which helps housekeeper to do any work about the house .
The first change is that they very simplify the life of people .
For example , now women do n't spend a lot of time at the kitchen , preparing the meal or washing up dishes .
They can only push on their dish mashiens and go to do something what they think more pleasant .
So with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time .
The computer also plays a very important role in daily life of people .
Some years ago people especially students had to run to lubraries in order to find a book about something .
But now they can use Internet , where you can find any information you need .
Very often I use Internet , and I must say it is very convienient .
The another modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone .
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends , of if something terriable has happened with me , I may not run somewhere to find a telephone box .
Finally , I can say that modern technologies very help people at their works .
With them people do their work more quikly and successfully .
I saw an advertising which seemed very atractive to me .
Firstable , I decided to come see your show to be pleased by the act of Danny Brook as I was so sad to find an other actor on the stage .
Another thing was the hours .
It 's enbelievable to be late with 45 minutes .
When I got to the tickets desk before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount , and the woman told me there were no discounts available as I read on the advertising .
I think you will understand it was not " my perfect evening out " as you said , but one of the worth .
For all these reasons I am asking you to give my money back .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , in fact she was so bad at that she put me in such trouble .
We stayed together in a host family in the surburb of the city .
We spent three weeks over there , the weather was great , the people we met very interesting so everything was perfect .
We had mostly a wonderful time .
We went there 3 years ago and I had only 19 years old as everyone know that the majority for beeing able to go out in the USA is 21 years old .
If you do n't have the majority your are n't allowed to drink or smoke , or even worth to go in a bar .
So one night Pat , who was 5 years older than I , and me decided to go out in a bar even if we knew I was n't allowed in it .
At the entrance , the security guard asked for identity card , Pat gave hers and told him that I 've forgot it home .
The man said it was OK for this time and we get in quite easely , we 've made it .
It was such a fun , we met a lot of different people , we danced , we had a wonderful time .
After a few hours of dancing we started to be thirsty .
We went at the bar and ask for drink with alcohol .
Of course by the time we get in it we forgot all the stuff about the majority .
The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking any time 19 years old !
The manager came , he called the police and the beginning of a great evening , ending with a night in jail and an expensive fine !
Thank you Pat for keeping so well a secret ! !
I would like to travel in July because it 's the only month I have two weeks holiday during the summer .
I would prefer to be in log cabins because I feel insecure staying in tent .
While I 'll be at the Camp , I would like to play tennis and swimming .
I 've done it for many years and I want to do both once a day .
I 'm very good at swimming and my level is medium at tennis .
If possible , could you let me know what I 'll need for example which clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend .
I 'm excited to go on holliday there and thanks to you , I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do .
Dear Kim , I want to tell you about my good experience I had last month . I 'd enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it has been fabulous .
At first , I 'd helped them to carry the material and we had fixed everything in the good order .
They were so many pieces that we had spent a whole day to prepare the scene .
At the end , we have had a beer and we talked together .
I was astonished to see so friendly and funny they were and we got good friends .
During the show , I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping with their and up .
It was unbelievable to realize that I 'd worked with stars and that they were my friends .
It is difficult to explain what I 'd particularly liked about my experience because the most memories are in my heart and I 'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people which I 'd known only for few days .
If possible , I would like introduce you to them , they are very nice guys .
During my last holiday week in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement of the " Over the rainbow " show .
I wanted to spend my leisure time well by taking in that cultural event .
First of all in the advertisement was written , as I had read that before , that Danny Brook would be starring in the show .
Unfortunately , the different actor stood in for in it .
The time of the beginning of the show was written at half past two p.m. and at half past seven that evening , again .
Lack of my time made me to go at the evening show .
And unfortunately again , from some reasons it was postponed to quarter past eight .
Another problem - in the advertisement was exactly written some of the discounts of the tickets .
No , alas in reality it appeared a mistake .
That was n't enough yet .
At the end of the advertisement as I noticed it was said something of perfect evening out .
It was n't truth .
That 's why I write my letter to you and I ask for my money back .
I was expecting something really better .
Mr manager , I warn you , if I do n't get my money back , we 'll meet at the court .
Yours faitully
I believe , living in a modern country , that science and technology affected any aspect of my daily life .
Looking back in the past , I can see , how big difference is between life of my grandparents and mine .
People living in the past could n't travel so far as we could now and could n't express the news around the world as we do it now , at present days .
They could not communicate with someone living in other country , often located far away from his own .
Using mobile phones , e - mails or internet , we have a better access to a lot of different news .
So , we are in better situation now .
But there are some drawbacks , which appeared last years .
For example a lot of pollution has raised .
We now breathe worse air in our lungs , then our grand - parents breathed .
I think , we are more addicted to do some things , which are not concerned with human nature .
For example , people are addicted today to watch TV or often using the mobile phones .
But I think and strongly believe , that we are the part of wildlife .
And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us , but determinly might destroy us .
A few students and me have heard about a fashion and leisure show .
That show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00 .
They show the latest fashion , leisure and sportswear ands something for the women : make up and hairstyle trends .
That show is free for students , so it 's also a big advantage .
We have it already discussed and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students a very keen ongoing .
I know that it is a change .
On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich .
Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunchtime .
I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge , as well .
Your sincerely
Are you dreaming of being a Star ?
Really ?
If you are famous it was your choice and therefore is a price to pay .
Of course you have fame and poverty .
But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking on the street .
To sum up I think , if you well - known you have to deal with that .
Everone knows you because of the journalists so ca n't just ignore them , can you ?
Besides , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show , which was advertised in the newspaper " Metro " yesterday .
This show takes place at Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14th March from 10:00 to 19:00 o'clock .
All my classmates are very interested in this show , which includes latest fashions , Leisure and sports wear , Make up , and Hair styles .
Moreover , one of the important thing for us is that entrance fee is free for students , because students are generally short of money .
We would like to suggest you change shopping date to Wednesday afternoon , because we have free time on Wednesday afternoon .
We would be very pleased if you could consider our recommendation .
Private Life For Everyone .
Everyone deserve private life .
However most famous people , for example football player and film stars , have not got any privet life .
They feel exhausted to be followed by journalists
Even they have an argue with journalists as they sometimes write unreal news .
On the other hand , some people need journalists to be more famous , because people can have news who are famous through journalists .
As a result , journalists should respect their life and always write real news .
I am writing to you because of the unpleasent evening I have spent recently .
I have always thought that plays of the Circle Theatre are worth of seeing , but two days before I was very disappointed after visiting yours theatre .
Ealyer I had seen an advertisement for the show but the informationes on it caused fals .
First of all I have not seen my favourite actor Danny Brook .
The second think is that the play did not start at 19:30 but at 20:15 !
The last think is that it was unpossible to get the theatre restaurant because it was closed .
I was told that it had been painted but nobody had written it on an advertisement .
At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back .
Yours sincerely
Modern technology is changing world every day .
I would like to write how it has influented my daily life .
I am a student of a technical univercity .
Some time before I did not know the internet .
When I neaded some informationes I had to go to liblary to find it in books or newspapers .
Now the only think I have to do is to go to computer room and turn on the computer .
The computer is helpfull when I want to contact somebody very fast .
The second think is that when I neaded a phone card to call somebody I had to stay in a long queue .
Now I just only put some money into a machine and I can take the card from there !
The last example is that I have in my house a lot of modern equipment like TV set , fridge or microwaves which help me for my living .
I am writing in behalf of my class- maid about the programme you had organised for us .
We all want to thank you for having choose such good places in London .
We are especially excited about the river trip to greenwich which will be in the first day .
We really liked the programme , but we have seen an advertisement for London fashion and leisure show that will happen on tuesday and we are very interested in go .
As you know our class are composed by girls and it would be very exciting for us if we can have a look on the latest fashions , make up and so on .
Although we would like to visit the science museum , we can leave it to the next opportunity , what we suggested to do is intead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure show and keep the afternoon programme the same .
We hope you accept this change for good .
We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible
Last summer I went to amazon on an expedition with other 10 people , such as a guide , a doctor , a scientist & all the rest as me were just curious .
We walked all day and took rest in the evenings .
We were not allowed to leave out tents during the night or until the day start , because of the dangerous animals which leave there .
One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without seen and started walking towards the river , because I want take some photographs of the sun rise .
The view took my breath of when suddenly something took my breath .
I was petrified because it looked as she was very hungry .
I knew I could not do any moviment for my safety but I did and for my surprise It run away .
With reference to your letter of 13th of June I would like to thank you for the prize your organisation is offering me .
Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm of my school , which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July .
I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of outdoor - sleeping really makes me happy .
Concerning the activities , as a matter of fact tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it , for the second activity I would like to enroll surfing , because my husband , who is already a proficient , keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport , and I think it is worthwile trying , therefore I 'd love to be in the beginners group .
I would like to know if you would be kind enough to send me some information on weather conditions for that period of time , the kind of currency I should take with as well as the vaccination requirements .
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking , computer , make up , languages , geographie to culture and civilization .
Students start their day at the Gym , where they learn the importance of being fit , that is way I suggest to film this activity .
Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life , depending on their levels they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enables stuff to communicate with clients in a proper way , students have to manage to speak at least three languages .
Another important lesson to film is " culture and civilization , therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only , as French say , " pot - au - fleurs " , beautiful faces to show off but also well read persons .
Last but not less important is the class called " know - how " wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress .
I would also take an outdoor lesson " training " .
The school works together with known companies of the branch as Mariot hotel , Air France Princess cruise among others in order to provide students with high qualified training .
To whome it may concern ,
I am writing to tell that I had a very disappointing evening regarding a musical show at your theatre .
Firstly , the advertisement told that Danny Brook was going to starr in a musical but it turned out a completely different person which was very disappointing .
It was very unprofessional of you to had printed a wrong starring name on the paper .
Secondly , according to the advertisment , the musical was supprsed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 which caused me a trouble .
As for my ticket , I was expecting to get a discount as a student , as it said so in the advertisement , however , it was not actually available which was very disappointing again .
Then , I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant which was recommended in the advertisement , however , it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation which I thought was very unprofessional .
With all the dissatisfuction above , therefore , I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it would have to be .
I hope that you will consider this letter seriously and try to improve your service .
Well , it all begun when Pat 's friend , Molly , went down to London ...
Molly went down to London for shopping and as she was walking the street .
She found familier faces on the other side of the street .
It was Vance and Sally whom she had not seen for ages .
Pat , too , are friend of them and has seen them time to time .
Molly , Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good - bye to each other as , to Molly , they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they have been dating , she wanted them to enjoy their own time .
After Molly went back home in Aberdeen , she told Pat that she had met Vance and Sally in London .
Then suddenly , Pat 's face turned to look confused and said in a small voice , ' Haven't they broken up long time ago ?
Sally must have a new boy friend ' .
Then , Pat realized that it was supposed to be kept as a secret but it just came out of her mouth !
She did n't mean to do so , but this kind of thing happens a lot .
Everyone is going to know that Sally has been cheating both on Vance and her new boyfriend and the Poor Vance is always the last person to know it .
Thank you for informing me that I have won first prize in your competition two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I will be pleased to send more further information which you need .
In addition , I would like to travel on july because my school will have finished that month so I will be able to go on holiday .
And if it is possible , I would rather be accommadated in log cabins because I would not like to share the bathroom facilities someone who I do not know well .
Thank you for asking me to choose the list of the activities .
Either I am in the school swimming team and I am intered in photography professionally .
Therefore I would like to improve my skills and knowledge about the subjects during my holiday .
Could I please know which kind of clothes I should bring with me and the company offers us some expensise money to spend ?
Once again , thank you for sending me information .
I feel , it will be the best holiday , I have ever had .
Perhaps just men or anybody who has lack of time or if you are looking for something to buy particular and shop has not range of variety .
Frankly , if I had a lot of money I would have spend my entire life to do shopping .
Although I am the one who loves shopping , I can not stand on the Easters , the Christmas and Sundays , because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food , buy some presents etc .
However , everyone prefers to do the same thing and the same time .
it causes over crowded shops , high - pitch noise , lack of parking place and if you have to go shopping with a child , the whole matters just enough to drive you crazy .
Despite knowing the difficulty we do not resist to do shopping in those days .
On the other hand , some companies offer special service such as sending your order with the post or on telephone .
It could be the solution , avoid busy hours or days , do not bring your child with you , choose the right shop which has park .
I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had last evening going to the theatre .
According to the advertisement , one of the actor who had to show was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons , there was another disappointing actor instead of him .
By the way , the musical show started at 20:15 , when it had to start at 19:30 : it was n't in late , it was to much in late .
And what 's more , there were n't discouts available and the theatre restaurant was closed : the only people who could enter in were the actors and the staff .
Well , it seems that it was n't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I pretend to have my money back , I waisted £ 20 to see a show which does n't respect the programm I payed for .

Science and technology have changed man 's life : that 's true , I do n't need to look how they affect the lives of the others , I have only to see how they have changed my life .
Radio , television , stereo , CD , computer : it 's hard to believe , but every day I 'm using something that borns from the technology .
Science and technology can be useful : see for example the use of tv in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have further information about something intersts you .
But they can also have a bad influence on people 's mind .
Since I went to school , I 've seen my way of thinking has changed : in my mind all must be in order like in a CD - rom of a computer .
It 's incredible but if I think of the key - word of mind , the only one I can think of is ORDER .
Then there are television , radio , stereo : another bad aspect is that every day , consciousness , I 'm using these instruments . They are objects which take part of my life .
In the afternoon I stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre : it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that ca n't speak with me , in order to meet new people , to speak with them to have a contact with the " human world " .
No , I 'm only a daughter of the technology .
Yesterday my grandmother asked me what will I do without the computer .
I answered to her saying I probably will die .
Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for English class , especially it is well - organised and has many different places we can go and we can see .
All of us in English class look forward to visiting these places .
However , we 'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we 've seen an advertisement on this week college newspaper . We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in London .
It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and Hairstyles , As you know , this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course .
We 've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as dress and hairstyle for an interview .
And mostly , it should a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class .
Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full - time .
Especially , it does not cost at all for students .
But the only problem for the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00 .
As we 're considering your programme we 're supposed to go Science Museum and shopping .
We 're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day .
But Mr. Robertson , these our suggestions are depended on your programme , we 're just suggesting .
Again we 're so sorry that we give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us .
We are look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely ,
But we could have everying we want to .
Home might be a mixture with moden styles and natural view as well .
These days a lot of contries have been worried about lands that ca n't have enough place to build houses .
The prises for lands are getting increasing it 's because of this reason .
So I think that the future home could be considered this points .
I mean most of home are going to be in a building like a flat .
Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building .
Most of them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors .
It means Japanese are planning for the future home .
But what my imagination is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices , leisure centre , shopping centre even school .
Because we are living in computerlised life , so we 'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well .
But one more thing , I believe these flats'll have a park for people who 'll be living in there .
And because it 'll be a big building we 'll able to see a whole view through the window .
In conclusion , our future home will have a natural view like these days home and give people a new technological home life .
I have heard you organised such a nice programme especially river trip and museum for our class .
In addition , make up and hairstyles shows will take place at the same time .
What is better , all students can participate without paying .
So we would like to suggest you to put this programme into the morning time on Tuesday instead of Science Museum and put science museum into free time on Wednesday .
Our homes have change with many comfortable things compare with the past .
As many inventors made lots of things , we can live in good facilites houses : But do you think no more comfortable homes will be built ?
Our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives .
For example , now we have a security safety like a bell or button .
That is , our security system will be much stronger .
On the other hand , what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home , such as a beautiful garden , a small terrace .
Because it is a instinct that people prefer comfortable place and want to take a rest in a peaceful place .
Last week I went to the Circle theatre , of which you are responsable , to se the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
The advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy .
Firstly there was a different actor in the starring ; you have written DANNY BROOK and he was absent .
I had joined the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot , but you have changed the program .
Moreover the advertisement said that the show time was 19.30 ; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late .
Another thing that was wrong is about discounts : you had written they were available , but they were not and so I had to pay the whole ticket 's price .
But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner .
So it was not " my perfect evening out " and because of my disappointment I am here to ask you some money back .
I think modern technology has changed human 's life a lot , expecially starting with the last century .
The changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it .
In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity to get out : I live on a little mountain at 160 metres of altitud so I can not go to the city using a bycicle . Because of my " isolation " telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and internet so study or do researches , because there are not book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town .
Moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city because it is too far and she is worried .
Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar ; I like very much play guitar , and in my free time I prefer play electric , than acoustic or classic guitar using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible .
I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long , except during July , so it is the only month in which I can travel .
I would be grateful if I could have the accomodation in a log cabin : I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height , I am so tall that I could never stand up .
I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be suitable not to stop practising it during July .
I can play basketball very well I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf .
I have never practised this sport , so I ca n't play golf at all .
I would like to know how much money you suggest to bring .
I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school - day , we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm .
Only who gets good marks can take part in theese activities , so sport activities are seen as a prize , so while the students are playing basket ball , tennis , volleyball ... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces , and our volleyball team is excellent .
It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry lesson because Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining ; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading Saffo , Alceo , Alcmone ....
In my opinion we should film science lesson , so that our teacher , listening to her own statements could realise that they make no sense !
I am writing to complain about your musical show . I am not really satisfied about it .
Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct .
Some problems of organisation seem to be appeared .
Firstly , I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case .
Unfortunately , the musical show was annoying .
Moreover , it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it .
I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing .
I would you informed us before .
Secondly , furthermore I had to pay full price whereas you granted us some discount prices .
Finally , you thought that you could grant us a perfect evening but it was not true .
Consequently , I would like you refund my bill .
Nowadays , we need modern technology to improve on daily life .
In my opinion , science and technology will have consequences on my behaviours .
First of all , as you also know , lots of technology have boosted since few years .
For example , without using internet I could not put me through to foreign people .
This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions . I feel free as a eagle .
I can take advantage of those technologies as mobile phone , lap top computer , television , to have contacts with different cultures .
Secondly , technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before .
Unfortunately , it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars , factories .
I ca n't go to the towncentre of big city .
There are links between the greenhouse , technology and me .
To conclude , we must not forget that science and technology is a tool to live better .
Be carefull , my own technology can kill me .
I can use it but with some limits .
I would like to thank you and give some information you asked about me .
Re time : I am a student and have examinations until the end of June .
The only convinient time to travel is in July .
I regularly play tennis since I was nine years old and I entered several competitions .
Are the meals free or do I have to pay for it ?
I 'm looking forward to your reply
Do you remember the concert I helped at .
We started at 7 am . to let them in the concert area .
This part had to be saved for later because the concert orginazer wanted to know the exactly number of visitors .
After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my place and went to help at the security section .
Here , I had to check the bags and couts of the girls .
Fans were n't allowed to take any sharp things with them , like knifes or scissors .
I met new people which I still see .
I 'm so glad I won this prize , but I have some questions for you , and of course , the answers you asked me .
Well , at first , I would like to travel only in July , because it 's my holidays here in Portugal .
And if it 's possible I would like to go after day 10th , because I 've got some things to do .
And for me , I think tents would be better , I do n't know why but , I feel more comfortable .
I think it 's because the last time I travelled ( with my friends ) , we stayed at log cabins , and when I was sleeping felt some thing moving in my skin , then I work up frightened and when I openned my eyes , I saw lots of big ants !
After that day , I 've never stayed at a log cabin .
About activities , I enjoy most painting , because I am a plastic artist since I was nine and I 've won lots of prizes with my art .
Everybody says I have an excellent voice , I like to sing when I painting too , it 's so relaxing .
I would like to ask what kind of clothe I probably will use there ?
And how much clothe ?
A lot , or few ?
Greatefully
I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop .
( I had to buy something for a friend , it was his birthday ) when I found a beautiful store , I stopped in front of it and start looking at the window ( outside ) , then I thought interesting and came in .
And then he said " if you promise me you wo n't get out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I 'm here , I take this cap off of my face " .
I did n't know what to do , I was sure he was a Robber , or even a murther !
Then I said " OK , I promise ! " ( frightened , of course ) .
Tina , guess WHO was he ? Ricky Martin ! !
I met all the staff , and Ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied Record .
- I could prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave .
- As far as accommodation is concerned , I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become cumbersome to me .
Please let me know if meals are included and if not which facilities are offered in the way of restaurants or self - catering .
Therefore , I think it is a time document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again , also by non - South Africans .
Generations of young South Africans black , white or brown will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through .
Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years .
A peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime , dying such a violent death .
Donald Wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA . police force .
It is my firm believe that this book will remain a piece of literature which will not lose its actuality , in a world where people are hounded for their colour or religion .
I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate on the organization .
I am also writting to make a suggestion and to give my opinion for next 's year festival .
An internation arts festival is a great idea , but at the last die there were starts and artists from only six countries , and it could be more interesting to have the possibility to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures .
I could not listen to one of my favorite classic concert , " La Moldava " by Smetana .
