In addition to this , after the show , we looked for the theatre restaurant which had been closed for repairs one month ago .
In conclusion , last night definitely was the worst entertainment experience I 've ever had in my life and that 's why I am asking you for my money back as compensation .
faithfully ,
Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship to and the ways we communicate with other people as well as our life expectancy .
With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access the Internet to communicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from us .
Despite the distances , we can keep our friendship close and in a cheap way .
Besides this , the information goes faster than it used to now and it 's available at the same time in every part of the world .
On the one hand , our time is taken with up learning how to deal with the new technologies .
On the other hand , we can feel more comfortable with them providing us with support in our hard tasks and setting us free to apply our intelligence and efforts to more important things .
For instance , we can research new ways of improving our quality of life .
In conclusion , we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware of how they are introduced into our lives to avoid the dangerous side of TECHNOLOGY .
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW " that I came to see at your theatre during my holiday in London .
First of all , in your advertisement for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part in the show .
But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking part .
And the worst thing was that he was n't so good in this role !
Another thing was that the show I went to was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 !
The people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long . And I absolutely agreed with them .
Also in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink .
But when I went there , it was closed . I do n't know why and I 'd like you to tell me the reason .
Well it was n't and I am asking for my money back .
I 'd like you to return it to me .
I 'm waiting to hear from you soon .
So , the next day Pat went and told his sister Sally that her friends were organising a surprise party for her birthday .
When Sally heard that , she was very surprised and very excited .
But because she did n't want to disappoint her friends , she was acting as if she did n't know anything .
She let them organise it !
But although she was acting like this she was very angry with her brother Pat , because he did n't keep the secret .
All her friends were going to meet there while she was at her swimming lesson .
When that day arrived they all went there as they had planned .
When the clock showed 8:00 they hid themselves under the tables and the other furniture .
After a while , the bell rang .
Suddenly they all shouted " Surprise ! " .
Sally , although she knew about it , seemed very surprised !
So her friends did n't realise that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the surprise party had a been success !
It was an unforgettable night ! ! !
I am writing to complain about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting " Over the Rainbow " .
Then , there were not any discounts available for the tickets as was written on the advertisement .
On top of everything , Danny Brook , the star of the night , was absent and his role was performed by a different actor .
I would like to ask for a refund because the whole evening was very disappointing and it was not worth the money paid
As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century , the style of dressing changes radically over the years .
So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be 100 years from now
If humans change to be more free from social rules , I think that their dress will also be very extreme and unlimited .
Everybody will wear anything he / she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strange .
On the other hand , if human society changes to become stricter and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of society .
All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule .
Perhaps the style of their dress will indicate their position in society too .
This is what I think the fashion of the future will be like .
The most exciting thing about this is that people wo n't think that their clothes are strange just , as we do n't think ours are .
A few weeks ago , I went to London , and I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical , called " Over the Rainbow . "
I 'm very sorry to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening .
First , I got there at 7:00 pm , because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm , and I needed some time to buy the tickets . I bought two tickets for Â£ 20 and when I asked for a discount , they did n't give me one , then I was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm .
Then when the show finally started I was very disappointed because I really wanted to see Danny Brook , but instead of him there was another actor .
Later when the show finished , I planned to go to the restaurant and get some food , but it was closed , because it was being repaired .
I would be very grateful if your could return to me half or some of my money , or even make the corresponding discount .
Yours faithfully
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , every time I tell her something , eventually everyone knows about it .
But this time it was something more important than any other time .
I was in love with a friend 's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair , but when I made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to Pat , everything started going wrong . Katrin , my friend , and the one I was being bad to , was very upset with me , and she was right , but I really did n't know what to do . I was in love with Brett , but I loved my friend too .
So I decided to talk to Brett .
We both decided to finish with this stupid affair .
It was difficult , but it was the best for everyone .
Then I decide to talk to Katrin . I was very sorry for all I had done , so I apologised to her and promised her that this would never happen again .
Now I 'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the whole world .
I 'm writing to complain about the performance of Over The Rainbow at The Circle Theatre on the 14th of June .
It is always a great opportunity to enjoy a musical when you go on holiday to London .
London is one of Europe 's biggest centres and you can always find the best in show business there .
Recently I decided to see Over The Rainbow , a very famous and well - known show .
Firstly , the evening performance was 45 minutes late and there were no discounts available as the advertisement had promised .
Furthermore , I was shocked when one of the main actors came onto the stage .
He was n't Danny Brook , one of the reasons for my choice of coming to see Over the Rainbow .
Finally , the Theatre Restaurant was being refurbished so we had to find another one for our evening meal .
This was n't " my perfect evening out " , as promised , and I 'll make a claim for half the money back .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your reply as soon as possible .
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
A century ago , when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plough behind them , we 've got the word " time " .
Why not talk about social life just sitting around a table with no rush .
Today we have to carry a mobile phone .
I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner I could see those busy people who are always on their way somewhere .
I heard the different ringing tones , and , what a miracle , you can change them on the train when you are restless .
A new world has opened up in our times ; tangible proof of this is the computer . I can send and save information and the possibilities are infinite .
In nearly every home you can find one and the users now and in the future are the new generation .
I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role to play , especially today when fuel is so expensive .
Watch how highly - advanced technology can be appropriate and helpful for me and others , if we only remember the importance of taking time to be together .
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the Circle theatre said about the musical show called '
First of all , the most annoying thing for me was the absence of Danny Brook because in my country I do n't have the chance to enjoy his excellent performance .
Another actor stood in for him , without any advance warning .
Another thing was the confirmed hour of the show because it started forty - five minutes late without any factual reason being given .
In addition to all this , there was no discount on the price of the tickets for students either , contrary to what I was told on the phone when I asked for more information .
Moreover , as I had read the advertisement carefully , I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theatre 's restaurant .
But , to our surprise , it was closed .
At the end of all these circumstances , we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint .
So , because of the things I have mentioned , I think I should be given some money back .
I look forward to receiving some information from you .
When this technological aspect changes so quickly , I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields .
I would say that the worst thing about this development for me is that I experience more and more stress in almost every aspect of my life .
There is not enough time to do a lot of things ; and if I want to do them , I realize that my life is devoted to my duties without leaving any time for pleasures .
Apart from this , another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities , being able to breathe fresh air several days a month when we go to the country .
In addition to this , there is less communication between members of my family , because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time , the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television .
Apart from this , advanced computer technology allows me to contact anyone the moment that I want to , while five years ago , when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters , which was a slower way to contact people .
On the other hand , and in conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living surrounded by lots of gadgets with different functions .
I am writing in order to complain about the Musical , OVER THE RAIN , I went to see at the theatre .
In the advertisement for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise there was a different actor , and that really disappointed me .
Then the show was supposed to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15 , more than half an hour late .
I had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there were n't .
And the theatre restaurant was being painted , so I could not go there .
As you may understand it was not a perfect night and I was not pleased with the show or even with the service .
That is why I am going to ask you for my money back .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Technology , are we prepared for these advances ?
It changes every day and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Technology improves our lives , we have high - tech equipment for cooking , for work , for study , well nearly for everything .
Nearly all of us today know what the Internet is about , but one or two years ago we did not .
And when we understood the Internet , we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able " to chat " with them was the height of technology .
But now we can even see the face of the person we are chatting to . The Internet is amazing .
And now of course there will be someone trying to improve it .
Technology changes our daily life , it makes our life easy to live and of course more comfortable with computers , televisions , radios et cetera and sometimes safer , as with medicine .
Definitely we should try to understand technology . If we know how to use it , technology will improve our way of life .
Thank you for organising the school trip to London .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure- and sports - wear , make - up and hairstyles .
It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with greater motivation .
Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show , we will be able to go shopping during our free time on 15th March .
First of all , they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrities .
Therefore , they deserve to lead a normal life as we do .
Secondly , no one has the right to look at anyone 's private life even if they are journalists .
Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of our human rights .
However , I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right to privacy .
To sum up , famous people are the same as we are , and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to intrude on their privacy .
I am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has put on recently , and , I want you to know , it has really disappointed me .
To begin with , the actor the advertisement showed did not appear , which I found very rude , and disappointing .
Moreover , the show started at a quarter past eight , forty - five minutes later than it should have .
I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because , as you may know , there were not any discounts available .
It is for this reason I think you should give me some money back .
To sum up , I would like to make my point about what happened in the restaurant after the show .
I think you have to do something about this to avoid it happening again .
If I had know it before , I would never have told her , because then it was really important for me , but , anyway , now , it does n't really matter to me .
At the time , Pat and I had a close relationship .
I told her everything that happened to me and vice versa .
We had many things in common and we knew each other as if we were sisters .
However , one day our friendship was broken .
I told her I was falling in love with my best friend and she decided to tell everybody in our group , despite knowing that it must stay a secret .
When I met Caballos , my best friend , I felt embarrassed and disappointed and I could n't say anything .
Now I wish all of this had never happened , while I try to forget it , laughing with Caballos and Pat .
I was very glad to receive this great news .
I entered this competition because I have always wanted to do this kind of thing .
In your letter you asked me when I would prefer to travel . I will be able to travel only in July because I have to work and I can take some days off in that month .
If it is not a problem I would rather stay in a log cabin because I do not like sleeping on the floor much , but if you can not put me there I will be fine anywhere .
About the activities I have to choose I would like to tell you something .
I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to do new ones , if it is possible .
I am keen on water and danger sports so I would choose climbing and surfing . I think it would be great if I learnt them while I am there .
Finally , I would like to ask you if there is any place where I can buy some souvenirs , if there is I will take some money with me , and I would be very grateful if you could send me a list of clothes .
It is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping .
You can go shopping alone , with friends or with your kids , but the best thing about it is that you feel that you have all the power while you are buying things .
Maybe it is not for you , maybe you are shopping for a present , but buying things , at least for me , is the best .
When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place , all trying to find the best prices and not caring about anybody , this could drive anyone crazy .
The long queues , crowded places , high prices , sales , all these things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it .
But my advice for people who like it so much that they can not help doing it is to try shopping in the afternoon . At this time no - one goes shopping and if there are some shops that are closed you can always go to a shopping mall .
Taking photographs during the holiday is a very good memory for me , and I can share my adventures with my friends .
So while I am at the Camp I want to take a lot of photographs and climb a mountain .
Fresh air , flowers and meeting some interesting people while you are climbing you have .
Finally , thanks for giving me this opportunity . I look forward to hearing from you .
Shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for women . You can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected .
Some people enjoy window shopping , but some people enjoy spending their money on clothes or shoes .
Nowadays , in a family , shopping is n't a woman 's job .
On the other hand , after shopping you 'll get tired and maybe you ca n't afford your credit card .
For instance , you wanted to buy everything which you saw , and after that , you do n't know how much you have spent .
If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet when you are looking at some interesting things .
It would be really awful .
However , shopping has pros and cons . It depends on personal taste .
I enjoy shopping very much . It can help me know what 's going on in the world .
But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping trip , then you wo n't feel so tired .
Thank you very much for your letter concerning the competition .
Here is the information you require .
In contrast to this , I could swim when I was six .
Furthermore , I once trained in a swimming centre , so I am quite confident as a swimmer .
Lastly , could you please tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take and do I have to buy insurance myself ?
The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video about my school .
In my opinion , maths , politics , Chinese , English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
They are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularly curious about .
As far as I know , English people are really surprised at the Chinese students ' advanced level in Maths , as well as their knowledge of politics .
This is a good opportunity to see how they learn in class .
As it is expected , painting lesson is an amazing one . You can find students using traditional Chinese ink to draw and write .
As well as these lessons , there are all kinds of activities such as sports meetings , racing competitions , and countryside activities .
In conclusion , besides all that I mentioned , I highly recommend you video the students ' daily life and interview them .
That will definitely make it a successful video .
The fact is it was quite different from the one I had expected to see .
First of all , Danny Brook was n't the leading actor , though his name was printed on the flyer .
Considering that I had to buy a full - price ticket ( even though I had read on the flyer that discounts would be available ) , I think you can understand my anger .
New technologies have affected people 's way of life for ages , by offering them better tools to help them to survive
Neither do I. In particular I 'd like to talk about the Internet .
I think that the Internet has changed my daily life most of all .
In fact , now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries , for example , in the morning and receive their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing .
Therefore I regard the Internet as quite a powerful tool and I believe it has given more strength to relationships between people .
I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I 'm really astounded by the way it has changed my daily life .
I am really glad to receive the first prize in your competition . It will be very pleasant joining the holiday .
Regarding your first question , I would like to travel only in July because it is my school holiday so I would not miss any classes .
I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as close as possible to nature ; it makes me feel better .
As regards activities I would choose singing and surfing . Surfing because it is my favourite sport . I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good at it . And singing because I really love it . I am not as good at singing as I am at surfing but I like doing it .
I would like to ask about some things which might be necessary for me to take with me , like what kind of clothes should I take , should I take my own surfboard , and what about money , should I bring some with me ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
As you know , I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand to the band called RAMONES .
It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well ; those guys really know how to play rock .
I only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with water whenever they wanted .
When the band had just started to play , lots of girls started to jump the fence getting very close to them . Some of the girls started to take their clothes off , which was the best part for me , but some of the security went there and took them away .
Afterwards , the Ramones had a short break and when they came back from their break they just went off !
I had a really nice time with them even though I would've preferred to stay at the front with the other people ,
but anyway it was a great experience for me , I hope to be able to help them next year .
I hope you 've enjoyed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I received your letter and would be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July because in June I will be in Austria with a friend and for August I have rented an apartment with my family .
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary equipment for camping .
While I am at the camp I would like to play tennis and do photography .
I play tennis very well since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice at photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it .
Will you provide clothes for the activities ?
Faithfully yours ,
You can come across a very disagreeable shop assistant and if you find what you wanted , you will not want to pay him or her for it .
Sometimes the assistant might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another assistant .
Two assistants are talking and , although they saw you enter , they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them .
Then , one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other assistant .
There is nothing more disagreeable than that .
Also , when you find a nice assistant and he shows you lots of objects , then you do n't find what you want , you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her waste his or her time , so you feel obliged to buy something .
All this is to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not .
Further to the unpleasant event that took place last week , it is my right to complain about the musical show I saw when I was in London .
First of all , when we arrived we went to pay and we gave a discount ticket .
It was not valid but the worst thing was that nobody explained the reason to us .
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15 . Then I felt disappointed because the main actor had been changed .
It would not have been such a terrible thing if the new actor acted as well as the other one .
If that does not seem enough , after the show my boyfriend wanted to take me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday .
After explaining my complaints to you I hope you send me some money back .
It was our last school year , so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate the fact we had finally finished school .
We knew that our parents would n't let us travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid them realising what had happened .
Kim , Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so did I. We were excited and we started to organise everything .
We booked some rooms in a hotel , next to the beach , and we bought all the useful things we were going to need .
It seemed like the perfect holiday but it was n't .
Pat was in love with my eldest brother , whose name is Jon ( I have never got on well with him ) .
Poor Pat , she did n't know my brother , she did n't know how he was .
We lost our holiday .
I feel very happy and I must answer your letter immediately .
I would like to travel only in July , because I will have a holiday at that time .
I 'm always having holidays in July . It is my favourite time for holidays .
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents , because I used to stay in tents when on holiday . I like it .
From the activities which you offer me I choose swimming and tennis .
I am very good at swimming .
I have done this sport since I was a child and I really enjoy it .
I 'm not so good at tennis but I would like to play it to get some practice .
Also I find that this sport is very good for my health and makes me feel better .
It is all about me .
First , what kind of clothes do I need to take with me , because I do n't know anything about the weather in California , and at tend how much money will I need ?
Some people like to go shopping .
I have never liked shopping .
It has always been a problem for me .
I do n't like to have many things in my house . I do n't like to have many clothes and shoes , and I do n't know what else .
Just the necessary .
I think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit ( ? ) , in the intellectual life .
They are wasting time in their life for nothing .
In my opinion we must spend more time on more interesting things than shopping , like sport , reading , chatting about ideas which make our lives better .
We must do something to help other people to feel better and be useful .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
I can go to Camp California only in July , because I have school in June and I must work in my father 's bookshop in August .
At the Camp I want to stay in a log cabin .
I do not like tents ; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins .
For the two activities I can choose , I would like to play tennis : I have some experience of this sport , because I played tennis for seven years and it is still my favourite activity .
I would like to know what sort of clothes I have to take ( if it is going to be rainy or sunny ) and how much money I must have with me .
Could you tell me what sort of equipment I will have to bring to do the activities ?
Do you know , last week I went to a pop concert to help my uncle , who is the director of the stadium of Lugano .
It was very interesting , because I did different things .
I cooked a meal for the artists , I spoke with the Bruce Springsteen 's manager and I helped a technician to install his equipment : the lights .
I was very excited , because this is my favourite group : I 'm always listening to their songs .
I took some photographs and I 'll show them to you when you come next week
I talked with Santana , the best guitarist in the world , too .
I would like to play guitar like him .
The next concert is on 19th June and I will be there .
Dear director of the Circle Theatre !
On Friday we , my friend and I , visited your theatre to see ' Over the rainbow ' .
It should have been my best evening that week , unfortunately it was n't .
The first thing that happened was that the show did n't start on time .
Instead of 7.30 am as your advertisement said , it started at 8.15 am .
When the show started Danny Brook was not acting , which was a great disappointment for us both .
We are both big fans of his
When the show was finished we went to the restaurant to have something to eat .
But then it was closed for repairs .
Because of all this trouble I think we should have our money back .
We both had Â£ 15 tickets .
And next time , make sure that your advertisement is accurate !
When were nine years old and were in third grade we had a ' House ' where we used to play all afternoon .
In fact it was n't a real house , it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house .
It was a secret place and we had promised each other not to tell anybody about it .
Usually we were cooking flower soup , and swapping secrets .
One day when I was there alone , I heard some other kids approaching . I sat down behind one of the stones so they could n't see me .
One minute later , Pat and half our class stood in ' the House ' looking and laughing at me and my flower soup .
Maybe she did it to make friends .
But in fact that day she had lost my friendship .
I recently visited London on holiday and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I am really sorry to say that I was very disappointed with the whole organisation of the musical , starting with the advertisement .
An actor that I admire and I wanted to see performing .
Unfortunately , instead of Brook I saw another actor , totally unknown to me .
Secondly , in the advertisement , the starting time of the musical was said to be 19:30 , but the show started at 20:15 .
I do n't want to be rude , but this is not professional at all .
Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock ,
So I am asking you : why do you advertise it if is not going to be available to the audience ?
I am closing this letter by telling you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back please
Yours faithfully
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
We are living in the 21st century and everybody is surrounded by advanced technology .
As a result of all this advanced technology , I became one of the daily users of modern technology .
Of course this is sometimes an advantage , when for example the computer helps me to do my job more easily , but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends .
Using the computer has become second nature .
And it 's not only the computer .
Every day I use the microwave for heating my food and of course
It is one of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I can not live without my mobile phone .
In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology offers humanity many things , some of them are good and some others are not so good .
It 's up to us if we use those technological achievements in the right way , and make our lives easier .
The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology it , is a benefit to you .
If you do n't it , is going to destroy you .
I am writing to you to express my disappointment with the musical show ' Over the rainbow .
First , I am very disappointed about the star .
That is why , because it finished later , I arrived late to a basketball game .
Another thing is that there were not any discounts on the entrance fee .
Finally , the theatre restaurant was closed because it was Sunday .
It is closed every Sunday ; you have to say that .
That is why I will be pleased if you give me my money back .
I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed , before we were on holiday , they would cancel the trip to Africa .
But , I needed to tell someone about it , so I told Pat about it .
The next day , all the class knew about it .
I was n't too worried because if someone was going to see my parents , I would tell them before not to talk about the exams .
But , then my mother talked to Pat 's mother and she mentioned it , and my mother cancelled the trip to Africa .
It was n't Pat 's fault , it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and , also , I knew that Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Not only were there Jazz and Rock but there were classical concerts as well .
There were wonderful plays and films which I hope there will be more of .
All the other shows such as dance shows , art exhibitions and talks by writers were very entertaining .
I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably priced for all events .
I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days at the Arts Festival in the end .
He came and said to the widower that he was to take him on his back .
The widow , who was afaid , told the man about the gold .
He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake in half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle .
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO DESCRIBE MY DISAGREEABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE LAST SATURDAY , AT YOUR SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
FIRST OF ALL , I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND 'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY FOR ONE MONTH .
MY INTENTION WAS TO HAVE A SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM . AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL ! ! !
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATE AND WITHOUT ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE PRICE OF THE TICKETS .
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES OF PUTTING ON A PLAY IN THE THEATRE .
BUT WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOUR COMPANY IS CHANGING THE TIME IT STARTS AT THE LAST MINUTE , MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISAPPOINTED .
THAT ISN'T ALL .
WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED , WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER , AS YOU SUGGESTED IN THE PROGRAMME , BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS ! ! !
NOBODY TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US BACK THE MONEY WE SPENT .
I FEEL YOU LIED TO ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT PROFESSIONAL .
I WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER , AND FOR OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE .
Yours faithfully ,
He enjoyed himself reading , and playing piano at home .
Despite his way of life , his best friend was Anna , the most popular girl in the school .
She told Pat everything that happened in her life .
When Pat was 16 , he decided to change his way of life , to spend more time with friends , but what could he do to get some friends ?
Definitely the worse .
He started to " sell " Anna 's secrets to all the boys in the school who were interested in her .
All the boys in the class went to Pat to find out what Anna was doing at every moment , and Pat was becoming ' friends ' with all the boys .
Everyone apart from Anna .
She did n't tell him anything anymore , and Pat did n't have any secrets to sell to his " new friends " .
Finally , Pat did n't have any friends , because he did n't have anything about Anna to sell .
Is it moral to get some friends by destroying and hurting other people ? I think NOT !
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I visited your theatre to see a musical show , " Over the Rainbow " .
I 'll try to explain why .
First of all , there were different actors in the show , but you did n't say anything about it before the show .
It started at 20:15 , but it was said that it would start at 19:30 .
As a result , I missed my train .
There were no ay discounts at all .
But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with a discount .
And the last disappointment was your restaurant . After the show .
It was closed because of the lack of staff
So in conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully .
With best wishes
And of course technology is also changing .
Not so long ago we had to do many things by hand , but now there are a lot of machines to do the same .
Now we have free time to do something else while the machine is doing our work .
It 's connected with our house , our workplace etc .
For example , before , I used to wash my clothes by hand , but now I have the latest version of washing machine and now there are no reasons to do it by hand .
Before , it took me 3 hours , but now it is free time and I can go for a walk with my friends .
Another example is that before we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy .
And it takes about 1 minute to make a copy not 1 hour .
So , I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the things that are really important in our lives .
It is really fantastic , especially the event on 13th March , when we are having a river trip to Greenwich .
The reason that I am writing is that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
It is worth visiting the exhibition and we would like to go there .
The show is established on Tuesday March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall , London , from 10.00 to 19.00 .
In the hall , there are four important themes ; latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up , and hairstyles .
This is a great opportunity for the students to learn about the changes in fashion and leisure and it is free .
We all agreed that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful .
On Tuesday morning , we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting the Science Museum and we will go there the following morning .
The visit the to National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on Tuesday morning .
That is all I would like to recommend you do .
I would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible .
The discussion about whether or not famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is a controversial one .
There are people from both sides of the argument who have strong feelings .
There is a reason why these people 's lives should be focused on by the media .
Obviously , they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happens to them .
In addition , their lives may be a good example for other people to follow .
Sometimes , a lot of people do n't know what to do and they should imitate the person who they admire .
However , there are some disadvantages that we should consider .
Firstly , famous people would like to do anything they want to without being focused on by the media .
I think it would be annoying if you did something and tomorrow your behaviour would be known by the public .
Even though , famous people can be a good example , they should be the bad habit for public .
A lot of people try to be like people who they admire , for example , buying the clothes that famous people wear .
The reason why they know what kind of clothes famous people wear is these people have a public life .
To prevent a lot of people from copying too much we should n't inform them of all aspects of the life of famous people .
I agree that famous people 's lives should be private .
It is of benefit to themselves and the public .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
So I can go to the camp in the middle of July .
I 've had unpleasant experiences on my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent .
In addition , as I haven't stayed in a cabin , I look forward to staying in a cabin .
Most of all , I 'm so happy that I could choose some activities . I 'd like to practise golf and tennis .
Both of them are my favourite sports and I 'm quite good .
What kind of clothes do I have to bring and how much money will I need ?
I would be grateful if you could send me further information .
Yours faithfully
But nowadays I find shopping is not always enjoyable .
I ca n't make enough money for my living expenses .
I have to control my expenses on the budget .
Anyway , I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets .
I refer to your letter in which you informed me that I have won the first prize in the competition .
You asked me for some further information and here are my " desires " :
Further I would prefer to stay in a tent at the camp , because I am already used to that , because I often spend my holidays in tents .
I would like to do painting , because one of my greatest hobbies is silk painting and so I think I can improve my abilities .
The second activity which I choose is playing basketball , because I love this wonderful sport .
I am in our school basketball team .
I hope that you are now well informed and I would like to ask you what clothes and how much money I should bring with me .
Thank you very much . I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely
My first task was to open the doors to let in all the Britney Spears fans .
I stood at the entrance and there I had to check the tickets .
Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both of them !
I had to tell one of them that she had to leave .
Such a poor girl !
At that moment I did n't like my position .
My second task was to look in all the fans ' bags to confiscate " dangerous " items . I saw really funny things like toothbrushes in the bags .
Summing up , I can say that it was a fantastic day , because Britney sang so beautifully and the performance was also super .
I hope you can imagine what a wonderful day it was for me .
I am writing , on behalf of all my English class , to thank you for the opportunity you are giving us to spend three days in London , but also to suggest some modifications to the programme .
The programme you have already organised is very interesting , especially because it provides a good combination of cultural visits and more relaxed activities .
But , on the other hand , we have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which includes a range of different stands .
The only day we can attend this show is Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall .
We are really interested in visiting this unhabitual show and the main advantage is that entry is free for students .
In conclusion , I suggest that we go directly to the show after the Science Museum .
We all agree that we have enough time on Wednesday for shopping .
I hope that you will agree to this suggestion .
Yours sincerely
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time
Famous people have always been the centre of interest for a number of people .
Their weddings , their holidays , their new haircuts and so on .
We can consider this problem from two different points of view .
On the one hand , these people chose to become public figures .
If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't go into politics or the movies !
But , on the other hand , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his / her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers .
The case of Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach extremes .
In conclusion , I would say that both parties , famous people and journalists , have to respect some rules .
As public people , stars and politicians have to allot some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful .
I am writing to you to thank you for your programme which will be for us in the next three days in London .
In particular , sightseeing by bus in the morning and the river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon are exciting activities .
Your programme for Tuesday is very interesting .
Fortunately , there is the London fashion and leisure show , which is held once a year .
This show would give us a lot of information about current activities , fashion and what is happening here in London , with for example the , latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up , and hairstyles .
It is a great opportunity because we will be able to learn about London culture . We can be part of this show and be up to date with style and fashion .
The show starts at 10.00 and finishes at 19.00 so we can change our afternoon programme to allow us to go to the show at the Central Exhibition Hall instead .
If you agree , after the Science Museum , we can have lunch at a restaurant near the museum , then we can go directly from the restaurant to the Central Exhibition Hall .
I am looking forward to hearing your opinion about my suggestion .
Yours sincerely ,
" Home " has so much meaning for people .
It does n't matter who they are , where they come from , what colour skin they have .
Home is an institution that creates humans and makes them people and good members of their communities .
When I think of " the Home of the Future " ,
If we had a home made out of plastic and also windows made out of plastic we could have our home for a long time .
If the door is broken , we can replace it quickly and it is not expensive when it is plastic .
We have more time to stay together at home , watching TV , playing games , etc .... because we can access the Internet at home . We can have all the information from the Internet .
I think it is the best means of education and working when we can stay and learn or work from home .
We have more time for the family , who mostly need care and love .
There will be a number of Developments in Technology in the future , which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love .
These 2 feelings can not be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home in the future .
You could probably show a few more films and interviews with the most interesting artists .
How are things going over there ?
It 's quite difficult to talk about our school rules actually , but I 'll try to help you somehow .
Hope it will be interesting for you . By the way , are you allowed to smoke in the school ?
Our teachers do n't let us smoke , of course , but you can always see some students smoking outside , so it 's not that strict to be honest .
We 're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teachers .
As for our rules at home , it 's always different and just depends on your family .
My parents are not very strict , as you know , and I appreciate them for giving me freedom .
They understand that I can make my own decisions , but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother any time we need it . I think the only rule in my house is to care about each other .
Dear Ms Helen Ryan ,
I am writing to you to answer the questions in your letter .
I was glad to hear the news from you and thank you very much !
When you mentioned the period of my travelling I 'm afraid I am only free in July .
Because I go on holiday in July , naturally , and I have two terms in June and August .
Therefore , I hope that you can agree to a suitable arrangement between you and me .
Furthermore , I would like to stay in log cabins , which I feel are a more American style of accommodation .
In addition , it should not be too hot inside during July .
Because I grew up in a town that is a seaside city ,
I started training in 1996 , and I have never given it up .
In particular , it was really good for my health during the growth period .
Photography is my hobby . I can remember that I used to take photographs of the exhibitions or during the holidays .
It will be nice for my memories when I am older .
In addition , it could show people how nice the places I have been are and the views I have got .
Finally , I would like to know about the weather in California .
Do I need to take very many clothes ?
Could you tell me the amount of money I should have during the holiday ?
Yours sincerely
Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands .
There are more and more retailers opening .
Therefore , people usually go shopping weekly or monthly .
In my opinion , women really enjoy shopping .
It seems a human activity during their spare time .
However , we are going to change from the traditional system to " e - shopping " .
It is new for customers . With technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want .
Therefore , it looks like a service and is also boring for the customer . I think most men dislike shopping .
They are always waiting for a long time for women to finish their shopping .
I believe that most busy people want to go shopping the quick and easy way .
Because they do n't like waiting for payment and wasting time .
Therefore , they would like to use " e - shopping " , which is getting better for their time .
The lifestyle has changed already from the past .
Shopping is a common activity in their life .
We must focus on the specific lifestyle , which will make us happy .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping only wastes time .
And you could n't get back any more .
I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - Over the Rainbow .
I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which was published in the newspaper .
The advert clearly says that discounts are available , but when I was buying the tickets , I did not have this offer .
The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes .
Apart from that , the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove , because of whom I was coming .
After the show we went to the theatre restaurant , but it was closed for refurbishment .
I was not really satisfied with the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out .
I therefore would like to have a refund of the Â£ 30 which I spent on the tickets .
Yours Faithfully
My story had already been spread the next day .
I did n't think I was going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustworthy .
But this idea was soon be put off since I noticed in the newspaper that I had won the writing competition .
I could n't believe my luck . I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Mediterranean Sea .
For the last few days , we spent our time sightseeing and shopping .
Last week , I had a week 's holiday in London , where I had n't been for 2 years .
I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it . We were happy all the time , but , unfortunately , the last day was the worst thing we have got , which was your musical show .
At first , you said that if we bought 5 tickets , we would have a discount , but we did n't have anything .
Secondly , we booked for the show at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 . What 's wrong with your clock ?
Thirdly , the person on stage was very strange to me , because I expected to see " Danny Brook " , but I did n't .
The last thing is we wanted to have dinner in your restaurant after the terrible musical show , but we could n't , because a waiter said your chef had gone home .
I have no idea what your business is . I have never seen anything like this .
By the way , I want you to give me my money back because of the wasted time , and I think that you understand .
Have you ever been to the Countryside ?
Try it ; it does n't need to take a long time to live in that place , but it will give you many things , which are different from your lifestyle in the city .
Nowadays you wake up in the morning , go to school or work on the sky - train , start your lessons on the computer , go shopping in a store which has an air - conditioner , watch cartoons on TV , or cook with a microwave oven etc .
Although modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living , can it give you nature , peace and fresh air ?
However much technology gives to you , it takes more from you .
Have you heard about the environmental pollution , the health problems and the moral problems ?
These all happens from human who want to live with science and technology , not the natural which the world gives it to us .
Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment , or I should say angry , better sad . I would never have expected that I could be so deceived .
This is not the first time I have been to your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays , but be sure " Over the rainbow " will be the last one .
As I am specially fond of musicals , I even travel abroad to see what 's new , I am probably one of your most devoted customers . I know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business .
We both know this is not true , or should n't be .
When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting , one of my favourite singers , whose career I have been following from the beginning , and Danny Brook never appears , and nobody gives any reason to the audience , how should one feel ?
Can you imagine how many things one could do instead .
Even playing some music to help us take it easy would have been better than nothing !
No announcement , no invitation ...
Well , I will not comment on that point .
That terrible place definitely needed refurbishment .
Well , this is not my idea of a perfect evening out , as you can imagine .
Each time I see the advertisement I get mad .
Of course , you should give a refund for the money spent , not only to me but to all the audience .
But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back , at least not as long as you continue as its manager .
New fabrics create new textures , all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , as always , just a few weeks .
Everything that is in fashion passes away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Fashion is a part of our lives , even for those who will never admit it .
Have you noticed that all the classic gentlemen wear the same type of suit ?
And what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people , do n't they all wear the same type of ugly but comfortable shoes ?
I am sure that fashion will survive for ages , it will even change to become easier to use and cleaner , because we all need to feel a part of our society , communicate our way of living and thinking , be part of a group and , at the same time , be different .
I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day at your theatre .
I am afraid that I think that the show was not as good as I expected : the reasons were many .
- Danny brook did not appear and I wanted to see him .
Please check your times because many people had to leave in the middle of the show .
- When the musical finished I was terribly hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisement said that it would be open .
In conclusion , that evening was not " my perfect evening out " so I want you to refund my money .
Modern technology has changed my life in many different ways :
On the one hand we have the advantages ; new technology allows you to do many things like flying , seeing in the dark , or it can even save your life when you are almost dead .
But on the other hand we have the disadvantages .
Technology makes your life easier but for how long ?
For example , the car was developed through modern technology . It makes your life easier but also more " dangerous " .
Because too many cars means too much CO2 in the air .
And everyone knows that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kinds of animals .
To summarize , the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems .
Regarding " Over The Rainbow " , presented at your theatre last night , I would like to inform you of the following problems .
Firstly , the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned in the advertisement for this musical show as " Danny Brook " .
As I was so looking forward to seeing Danny 's performance , I was very disappointed .
I think you should have informed us of the change of star before starting the show .
In addition , I 'd like to know the reason why the actor was replaced .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisement .
The third point is our tickets were not reduced at all !
The Ad says that TICKETS : Discounts Available .
Lastly , your theatre restaurant was already closed when the show finished , because the start of the show was late .
As described above , it could not be a " perfect evening " .
Therefore , I would be grateful if you could give me back some money .
She told Sally about our plan , indeed our " secret plan " !
But , Mark , Pat and I were planning a birthday party for Sally on June 2 at her own home .
Her parents had already died when she was in high school .
After marriage , Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have children .
In spite of such difficulties , she always has a pretty , charming smile for us .
On June 2 , because of Pat 's mistake , Sally already knew our plan .
We were enjoying ourselves at her home celebrating her birthday .
" Oh ! You came back for me ! Nigel , " Sally cried with pleasure .
Nigel himself was a big " surprise " present for Sally .
I will never forget her happy face .....
We had a brilliant night .
It is a very good schedule , especially because you have considered different activities for us .
Personally , I think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attend , and we are all interested in the latest fashion .
We noticed that it is free for students , so the price of the trip will not rise .
We discussed the programme , and because the show will take the whole day , we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having free time all afternoon .
Yours sincerely
I was n't sure of what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me was driving me mad .
I could hear the crowd shouting ' Go , go ' .
That was my only chance . Only a few more seconds , otherwise my turn would be over .
I did n't even think of looking down .
Then , by some ' strange power ' , my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
The clock was running .. tick , tock ... And suddenly everything stopped .
I felt an enormous peace .
Those minutes up in the air , feeling the wind in my face , were fantastic ....
Fortunately , I was n't alone .
Thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three - day programme in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there , especially in the National Art Gallery .
Nevertheless , the students in my class have some suggestions for you concerning how to make it even more interesting .
The thing is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
It will be held in the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday , 14th of March , from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Naturally , all the students are interested in it because the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles will be shown there .
Furthermore , students can enter free !
We are concerned that this is a great and the unique opportunity for us to see this show , as it takes place only once a year and only in London .
Probably , you will agree to put the London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of the Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday .
Thank you for your attention and understanding .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will respond to what people say .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers which will control everything , every item of furniture , light , temperature .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to programme them , as they have to do nowadays .
Maybe children will not have to go to school , they will just stay in their rooms and study on a computer , gaining some kind of on - line education .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , cups will be washed automatically .
It is possible that only one computer will do all this and it will have its own personality , voice , eyesight ..
This will be your home , another member of your family and your house or flat as well .
This is my vision of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it .
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED WITH THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW AT THIS THEATRE .
FIRST OF ALL , CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS ADVERTISED , THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK , BUT ANOTHER , UNKNOWN PERSON .
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE , THE SHOW WAS DELAYED , STARTING AT 20:15 .
AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH , I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT ON THE PRICE OF THE TICKET , ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET .
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING , I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT AT THIS PLACE , BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW .
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED , BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT AS PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED .
SO , I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND ALL OR PART OF THE MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW .
IT 'S UNDENIABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING .
NEW INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND SCIENCE HAS MADE QUICK PROGRESS . AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE 'S DAILY LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGING AS WELL .
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED , I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT 'S WORTH POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING :
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST MEANS OF TRANSPORT .
CONSEQUENTLY , WE'VE GOT OPPORTUNITIES TO KNOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND TO CONTACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE , TOO .
SECONDLY , WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONE , BY THE INTERNET , WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY , BUT ALSO ABROAD .
FINALLY , WE SHOULD CONSIDER , TOO , THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES , MAINLY IN MATTERS OF HEALTH , THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON .
IN CONCLUSION , I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY .
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected , as it completely contradicted the advertisement .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor starred in the actual show and his performance was absolutely horrible , and disappointing .
Secondly the start of the show was far from punctual .
According to the advertisement , the show which I had gone to was supposed to begin at 19:30 , but the show did not start until 20:15 .
Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be offered .
However , by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed .
I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement which , stated that it would be my ' perfect evening out ' , when it was quite the opposite .
In addition , by way of compensation , I would like to have a refund , and an explanation for such a show .
Yours Faithfully ,
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
During these past few decades , or rather in the 20th century , there has been a great deal of development in modern technology .
One of the essential developments has been in our means of transportation .
The invention of cars , planes , trains and other similar forms of transportation has enabled us to go from one place to another in no time .
This enables us to save a great deal of time and effort .
Quite recently , in my country electric bicycles have been invented .
This , compared to the traditional bicycle , is less physically demanding and less time - consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination quickly with hardly any effort at all .
Another significant technological development is the invention of electrical appliances .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances , such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves .
What changed my life most are portal computers .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who often travels .
Before I used computers generally , it took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and look up information .
With a computer , however , all this is done in a matter of seconds .
Modern technology helps people in many ways and is indispensable .
However , if we rely on it too much , we could become lazy and apathetic and , as a result , will not be able to live without it once it is gone .
I am writing this letter to show how disappointed I am with the musical show " Over The Rainbow " .
First of all , I was expecting to see Danny Brook acting but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared .
When I saw the advertisement for the show it was written that the show would start at a half past seven but it started at a quarter past eight .
Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for a discount but they were n't available .
When the show finished I was intending to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disappointing experience I have ever had .
Modern technology has been changing human life since the first man was born .
When I wake up I take a shower using electricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus , when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave then I watch TV and do my homework using a pen . When I come back from jiu - jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed .
About a millennium ago everything was different ; people did n't have electricity , they cooked their food on the fire and they did n't have pens .
Comparing these two realities the reader can notice that modern technology has changed our daily life very much .
I am replying in response of the competition I won .
As you asked in the letter , I will write everything I need to know about the trip .
First of all , I would like to travel in July , because , during the other months , I will be studying , preparing myself for exams or I will be away travelling somewhere else with my relatives .
I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in a tent , simply because it 's a new experience and I would like to try everything new .
Regarding the two activities I have to choose , I decided to choose a new activity that I have never done before , which is Sailing . I am a total beginner at this .
The other activity is Photography . I am not an expert , but I know how to use a camera . All I want is to improve my knowledge .
Finally , I need to know what kind of clothes and how many clothes I should pack .
Is there any place where I can wash my clothes ?
I also need some information about the money I should take .
I will be waiting for a reply .
Yours sincerely ,
But now I have found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped .
All I could think was " Oh my god , I 'm gon na be talking with and helping the most famous pop bands ! "
I was so excited that I could n't believe it .
When I arrived to help them , they welcomed me and were so nice to me that it seemed we had known each other for ages !
They were n't the kind of people that think they 're gods .
I helped them with organizing the stage , cleaning everything , fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guitars !
I do n't know exactly how I felt . Sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream .
I hope you liked everything I said and I hope you reply as soon as possible .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering at the shows at your theatre .
Last May , I had a week 's holiday in London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW , the MUSICAL .
I was really excited about the idea of seeing that show .
First of all , when I arrived , I found a note stuck on the front door that informed me about changes to the list of performers .
He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were poor .
Secondly , I want to tell you that the show started forty - five minutes late .
As to the tickets , I want to say that they are very expensive .
I had put some money aside for that month , thinking about the discount , but when I went to buy them they said that discounts were not available .
To conclude , the restaurant was closed .
I would appreciate it if you could send me my money back .
Waiting for your reply .
That is why she could not be a spy .
When she was a girl , Pat used to play spy and detective games .
Her mother gave her a book for her birthday about how to become a spy .
She had watched all of Mission Impossible and gadget , the inspector series .
When she finished school , she went to study at the Agent Training Agency where she learnt about guns , clues , agencies , etc .
She was the best student they had ever had .
She was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a Trade Centre there .
At first she walked around the bay - side market , looking at all the people who were there .
When she saw a man , different from the rest , talking with one of the salesmen .
Immediately she interrupted and told the man that she was a secret agent .
You can imagine what happened to her cover .
Here is some further information about myself and a few enquiries .
First of all , I am sorry to say that I can only travel in July .
Secondly , I would like to sleep in log cabins while I am staying at the camp .
I had a bad experience last time I stayed in a tent .
I was terribly attacked by a bear and it still gives me nightmares !
Surfing was a new sport to me which I took up recently .
It is really fascinating to challenge the waves .
I wish I could learn to be better so that I could enjoy it more in the future .
Also , what kind of clothes shall I bring with me ?
How much money is it appropriate to bring ?
I really wish you had been there with me on one of the exciting nights in my life .
It was a pop concert by Steps in the M.E.N Arena .
A few minutes after the concert began , a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking whether everything was going well according to the timetable . If something comes up , she should inform the other staff .
I was then taken on to cover her job .
I was given lots of paper with many different times on it .
I did manage to " study " them though , thanks to the other staff .
They patiently explained to me my job even though they were fairly busy themselves .
Then I found it was not as complicated as I thought at first .
And I guess I did a good job as everything was going quite well .
I saw all the members of the band backstage , how they changed their make - up , hairstyle etc .
They were even making jokes with me and other staff .
I was impressed when they kept saying " thank you " to the staff .
Indeed , they can not succeed without their help , can they ? I was lucky to have this chance and able to learn how they work behind the scenes .
All in all , it was a once - in - a - lifetime experience .
As for accommodation , I would prefer log cabins , because I believe they are more comfortable than tents .
I have never tried those sports , because they are quite expensive .
Could you tell me what the weather conditions in California are at that time of year , because I want to know what clothes to take .
Will I be given any pocket - money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expenses ?
First I would like to say that making a video about daily life at our school is a great idea .
Below are my suggestions for what should be filmed .
The computer class could be also there , because programming and internet surfing are quite interesting .
Martial arts are really exciting and are a great thing to film .
I 'm sorry to be writing to you about such a bad thing , but my evening at your theatre was n't as perfect as you advertised : it was n't perfect at all !
I was pleased to be seeing Danny Brooke , he 's my favourite actor , so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the stage !
By the way , what really upset me was the starting time .
According to your advertisement it started at 19:30 , and what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15 !
You had promised discounts on the cost , which was from Â£ 10 to Â£ 20 , but despite what I thought I had to pay Â£ 20 without other any options .
In the end , I thought I could enjoy myself visiting the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they did n't explain to me .
As you can see it was not a perfect evening , was it ?
I 'm asking you for my money back , you can do it , ca n't you ?
Wondering your comprension
Yours sincerely
As I see it , the Old Man and the Sea is a really exciting book .
The main character is the old man who has to fight against the sea to stay alive .
This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish for something good .
The man keeps constantly in contact with it .
They 're fighting for the same reason with the same strength , the man has to kill a brother , as he calls the fish .
If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man the same thing .
He respected and still loved it .
But , afterwards , life 's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that 's the most difficult thing to face up to .
I am writing to give you information about myself .
Even though I would like to travel , I am only available in July , because I am a high school student .
Thus I have not got a long holiday .
I just have one month .
On account of the fact that staying in log cabins is much more interesting than staying in tents .
As far as two activities are concerned , I would choose singing and photography .
I can sing plenty of songs , which include English songs and the Japanese songs , and I have a part - time job singing at a restaurant .
Although photography is not as good as singing , I am very interested in it .
I have been studying photography since I was 15 years old .
I got third prize in a competition last year and my level is professional now .
Furthermore , I am going to enter a competition next year .
I would like to ask for some information about what kind of clothes I have to wear and how much you charge .
Shopping is not always enjoyable . Sometimes there is a long queue or a machine is broken .
A lot of circumstances will arise .
I had an unpleasant experience .
It was at lunchtime .
Everybody had gone to buy lunch in the supermarket . In fact , nobody likes crowds and queues , especially not in the summertime .
I was queuing in the middle of row .
I chose this aisle because I thought it was quicker than the others .
Although there were finished two people , next was me , something was happened .
Suddenly the customer thought the receipt was not right . She did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make a mistake . They argued about this thing .
The shop manager came to solve it .
Obviously , I had to try another aisle .
It was the longest queue I have ever been in .
Shopping is enjoyable , if you are lucky .
Even though I think most of the time it is very interesting , sometimes it gets people upset .
Ideas to Improve the Festival
That is why I 'm writing to you , to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not .
Firstly , it is a good idea that the Festival is international .
But in the advertisement it was said that the artists were from all over the world but I saw only six nationalities .
Secondly , the classical concerts were excellent but the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk .
Thirdly , I noticed that the plays and the films were good entertainment .
They attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that .
Finally , the reasonable price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point , because all kinds of people can afford to buy them . I also think that you should have a snack bar or a little restaurant so that the people are not too hungry and moreover you can make a lot of profit
In conclusion , on the whole the Festival was a success , but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve it .
I have received your letter and thank you for it .
I am very happy to hear from you and I hope that you are well .
As expected , I want to talk first about my school and then about my home .
So the rules are clear , you need to participate in the lessons and also pass the exam in June 2000 .
In our class , we do n't have a problem with students who dislike working , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to stay there for years and years .
In my sweet home , my parents let me do what I want , because I am an adult now .
But when we are out , we have to be careful not to disturb the other people .
It is the same in our family . For example , my parents dislike hearing music throughout the whole house or that I let dust everywhere .
When I go out , they do n't give me a time to be home , because I 'm sensible .
In conclusion , I do n't want to change anything in my house or at school , because I totally agree with the few rules that I have .
I hope these few pieces of information can help you and I look forward to hearing from you
I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow the , musical show , which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night .
First of all , Danny Brook was not starring , even though it was stated in your advertisement that he would perform , but the main role was played by an unknown actor .
Secondly , I had to wait for forty - five minutes for the show to start , and it was 20:15 ( not 19:30 ) when the curtain went up .
Another disappointing thing was that I could not get a student discount , even though your advertisement promised them .
As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one of my week 's holiday in London .
I would like therefore to have my money back , so please send me a cheque for Â£ 20 to the address above .
Every season we can see the arrival of new styles , fabrics and proportions .
Let 's try to imagine what clothes will be like 100 years from now ?
There will be a mixture of styles from different times in the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
New technology and science will change fabrics , so they will change their colours during the day .
In the future people will be even more concerned about pollution and harmful UV - rays .
With so many choices , shopping for clothes is going to be even more fun than it is now .
The fashion of the future will not be the same as today 's , but it will be more exciting and fun !
I was very surprised to win .
The answer is the following one : I can only travel in July because I have to work all August .
I can take holidays only in the month of July .
I prefer the tents because I never use this kind of accommodation .
I have chosen the two following activities .
The first one is tennis and the second one is sailing .
I have been playing tennis for many years .
I have even entered competitions .
I like this game a lot .
I have chosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport . I love water but I have never tried this sport before .
Yours sincerely .
The first thing is the location of the shops .
Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go shopping .
The third thing is the crowds .
Everybody does their shopping at the same time and often in the same place .
It is almost a battle to buy different things and to pay for those things .
People are often irritable and aggressive .
When you are a man and your wife asks you to go shopping , be patient !
Because women love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes , music , perfumes ...
I am writing to give you the information that was requested in the letter you sent me .
Firstly , the best date for me to travel will be in the second week of July because I will be very busy at any other time for work reasons .
Secondly I would prefer sleeping in a log cabin because I would feel much more comfortable .
One reason is the cold , and the other is that I can not sleep on the floor because I have problems with my back .
The last one I have never tried but I think I could play it well because I am very tall and that could make things easier .
yours sincerely
I 'm very sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I had to make a trip to my parents ' house because my mother had an operation ; do n't worry , she is all right now .
The things I did were : preparing and checking the equipment , I had to clean all the stadium , making sure that all the lights were in perfect working order , that the singers were comfortable and relaxed , etc .
The most exciting thing was talking with the band , asking them questions and of course listening to the music and enjoying the incredible show .
It would be a great pleasure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I ca n't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm .
First of all , as a reply to your letter , I 'd like to say , that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full - time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time .
With regards accommodation I would prefer log cabins , as they are more comfortable and I like convenience .
As for the list of activities , I choose climbing and surfing .
I would appreciate it if you sent me a reply to my Questions as soon as possible
It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money in our bank account .
I just ca n't understand people who , with a smile on their faces , spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things .
They are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbour jealous .
So , as a conclusion , I might say that shopping is n't enjoyable at all and I 'd rather stay at home instead .
Sir , Madam
I spent one week in London and during my visit I had the good fortune to see " Over the rainbow " at your theatre .
You wrote that the main actor would be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing .
In the advertisement it was written that the show would start at 19.30 but it started 45 minutes later , at 20.15 !
Because of the advertisement I thought that I could a get discount on the tickets available but I could n't .
After the show I needed to drink something in the theatre restaurant as the advertisement conceived , but it was closed .
And there was no reason why .
So you can see that it was not a so perfect an evening for me as I had expected .
Now I hope that you can understand my request for some money back because of the trouble I had .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
This was the only reason why she had not got a lot of friends .
When Pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems .
But after a few times the others would see that Pat could n't keep secrets .
So they stopped telling her anything important almost immediately .
Sometimes it finished with the others only saying : " Hello , how are you ? " And then going away without listening to the answer .
During the day she worked hard so she would not think too much .
But at night , when it became dark the dreams would come .
She dreamed about good friends , the time that had long passed by and she dreamed of someone who she could tell her own secrets .
It was Katha , a girl who had the same problem as Pat .
So they both found the person they dreamed of .
Dear Sir or Madam , I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow , and it has been quite deceiving .
I am writing to you to complain about five or six utterly outrageous facts .
In the advertisement for the show , which I had picked up in the hall of the theatre , there are about five points which were not true .
To begin with , as far as the cast is concerned , Danny Brook should have performed as the main character , and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not .
Insofar as I came here especially to see him play , I have been very disappointed , and this could be the understatement of the year , as he is my favourite actor .
Apart from that , the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15 !
Could you explain to me the reasons for such a huge delay ?
Thirdly , the ad mentioned possible discounts .
Personally speaking , I did n't see them and did n't even hear of them : I asked about it , but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts .
On top of that , the restaurant was closed for renovation !
How can you dare publish an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know it is closed ?
To put it in a nutshell , and quite honestly , I would like to emphasize the fact that I did not have a " perfect evening out " at all , such as was promised in the ad .
For all these reasons , I would like , dear Sir or Madam , you to give me my money back .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
If only Paul had known that before ...
It all began when Paul went downstairs in the Heavy Sleep .
As he closed his eyes , he started to travel along the dark paths of his conscience .
He went through the valleys , plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape .
While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a huge grey stone , on the top of which he could stare across the whole wood .
Paul was wondering whether this beast could be aggressive when the creature said these words , " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
The boy could not believe what he was hearing .
How did the beast know his name ?
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to get out of the Heavy Sleep .
Please , bring me with you , into your reality ! "
At these words , Paul suddenly awoke .
Relieved , he thought that bringing the creature into his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie , and with it , threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape , when he heard a creepy sound under his bed .
He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat them .
Unfortunately ... one hour after that , a local zoo keeper arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage .
There she died because she did not have the Faerian food necessary for her survival .
This is how mankind destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream .
This is why mankind ca n't be relied on .
This is how secrets are betrayed , and the result .
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows at the " Circle Theatre " .
The show was called " Over the rainbow " and should be , to quote the advertisement , London 's newest and best musical show .
I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook for someone else I was very disappointed .
Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should have begun at 19:30 but it started after a delay of 45 minutes .
Furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement , but I had to pay the full price although I am a student .
The perfect evening you promised in your advertisement was the complete opposite and that is why I want to get some money back from you .
I am looking forward to a prompt answer .
We have had a lot of fun together because we have the same interests .
When we were 15 years old we decided to drive my mother 's car on a day when my parents were absent .
I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know about this .
Pat promised to tell nobody about our purpose .
Two days later my father asked me whether I had at any time thought of driving a car without a driver 's licence because he had heard about it from some parents of my friends at school .
He told me for two hours what could happen if I did that .
I was very surprised because Pat and I were alone when we decided to do it .
I felt very disappointed then but I have learned something new about humans ; it is that you can only trust yourself .
Pat and I are still good friends but we have never shared another secret .
I was very disappointed when I read your advertisement . I was keen on your show , but I have not seen the same show , I have seen one which looked like it , but was n't it .
First of all , I was attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who performed effectively that evening .
These actors appeared forty - five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement .
This lateness prevented me going from to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing !
For all these reasons I wish that I had not gone to see that show , for which the tickets were not available .
And in conclusion I want you to give me my money back , ( I still have the advertisement if you want proof of what I say ) .
You have the choice , either you do what I want , or I attack you in the courts .
Yours sincerely
When I read this book , I was fascinated by the willpower of the old fisherman .
This willpower is so amazing , he has all the elements against him .
His boat is so small and poor , he is old , it is hot and he is alone without any chance of meeting anyone who could help him .
He does n't want help because he wants to prove to the little boy and himself that he is not really old , even if he has lived many years .
I think these are the reasons for his willpower .
He could have triumphed over the fish because of his knowledge of the sea but it is principally because he has known research in the depths of his mind .
To conclude I think the most difficult situations allow us to discover ourselves getting out of ourselves .
I have just received your letter of congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need .
First of all , I would like to start with the time of the trip .
I would prefer to go to the Camp in July .
As regards accommodation , I would choose to stay in tents .
That is because I am keen on hitchhiking and I am used to living in tents .
As to the activities offered , I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping , although I am not very good at the last one .
As regards swimming , it is my passion from childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now .
Finally , I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information . I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me .
I do n't know much about the weather down there , in California , so I am rather puzzled about what to wear there .
Also , I would like to know how much money I will need and which expenses I will have to cover myself .
Subject : to suggest what should be filmed for a short video about the daily life of our school .
The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see when watching the short video film about the daily routine of our school .
I have conducted a little survey on the subject of my report and I have discovered that most of the pupils of our school think that the region and the area around school should be filmed first .
Personally I agree with their opinion and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school .
We should film our gardens around the school and the pitch with the courts for volleyball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning .
The next things to be shot , according to the majority of students , should be the teaching process and the breaks .
Here I should also mention the decor of our classrooms and the atmosphere in them .
People should see all the renovations that have been done during the last few years and all the modern conveniences that were installed for both students and teachers .
And as regards breaks , students consider them to be a very important part of school life , despite all the mess and noise .
And the last but not least thing we should include in the film are the outdoor activities , which our students are provided with in our school . We can make some short shots about the school theatre and its events and also about the sports clubs and their competitions and awards .
In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey conducted among the students of our school .
First of all I would like to thank you for the chance to make such a gorgeous trip .
We are really looking forward to visiting the city and going to the museum and the gallery .
We are interested in visiting " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " during our trip .
The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion , hairstyles and make - up , and also the leisure and sports wear .
Furthermore it is totally free for students .
All these exhibits are really important and exciting for us because , nowadays , fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it .
We think that we could go there the on 14th of March , in the evening , instead of going shopping .
This one could be moved to the 15th in the evening .
It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we totally agree that we do n't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum .
We truly hope you will consider our change .
Yours sincerely
Almost everyone relates famous people with photographers , articles , money , fans ...
Normally , one person 's dream is to be rich and famous but without that stuff about being without privacy
Nowadays , there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements , reports about their last romance ... but not everyone does the same thing .
On the one hand you find the ones that are well known and never talk about their private life .
They use the publicity exclusively for their work .
On the other hand , there are the ones that are also respectable but , apart from their relations with journalists because of their work , they really need to be constantly sought by photographers .
I mean , they enjoy being the focus or the centre of attention for everyone , even though it means seeing their lives .
The media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work , politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous .
Nevertheless , sometimes the media disturbs their lives in a wrong way .
I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found out that I won the competition .
This is because it falls on my semester holidays and it is also summer in America .
This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays , as well as allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and experience .
It will let me get up close to nature , and experience life in the wild .
However , among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best . I have a lot of experience with swimming and have represented my school before .
Last but not least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
Will I be going out much , or just staying in Camp California all the time ?
The concert was held in our school hall .
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment .
I also got to install new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
I enjoyed installing the studio equipment in particular .
It gave me a chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics .
On the whole , it was a fun experience to work with friends , putting in bulbs , attaching lights and adding speakers .
Yours sincerely ,
Thank you for your letter of the 2nd of March .
I am very keen on attending Camp California in the U.S.A.
I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this trip only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August .
I 've always stayed in tents when I have been on the university camps so I would prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in one .
Considering your activities at the Camp , I would choose singing and painting because I am the lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity .
Also painting is my hobby because I have always painted when I have some spare time . I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and how much money I should bring .
I look forward to going to your camp in the near future .
Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable for different reasons and places .
In the first place , some housewives do n't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second .
To make matters worse , you you realise have forgotten to buy something when you get back home .
Another argument against shopping is the lack of items that you really want .
Sometimes you see a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold or there is n't one left in your size .
The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay for everything you buy on your credit card .
When the bill comes to Â£ 1000 , you will be shocked and regret what you have done .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidentally get into a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully .
Dear Sir ,
My wife and I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
My wife and I are both fond of theatre , musicals especially .
It is so rare to see musicals in Paris that we decided to book two seats for " Over the rainbow " .
Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly from the theatre .
And we had to pay Â£ 20 a seat .
But , instead of him , we saw an unknown actor ( who really needs singing lessons ) .
Perhaps it was a stroke of luck !
So we want you to give us our money back , the show was n't worth the price .
Obviously she was not surprised , but she was certainly angry . Really angry ! !
She suspected our father wanted to please himself .
Then , we decided to give her a red bicycle .
Thank you very much for your letter , which I received yesterday .
I am very happy that I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
Also I am pleased that I do n't have to pay any expenses .
I would like to travel at the end of July .
The last two weeks of July are convenient for me .
In your letter you ask me to choose which type of accommodation I prefer .
I would like very much to stay in a tent .
Last year I stayed in a tent with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it .
In summertime the weather is good and I do n't see there being any problem with anywhere I stay .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance to do some leisure activities such as swimming .
I am good at swimming and fast .
Another sport I love is basketball .
Hopefully I will meet some other girls interested in the same sport .
So we will all play as a team .
Can you let me know if there are any facilities for washing my clothes ? If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
As a housewife I have a good idea about it .
Sometimes I go twice . We all have to do our shopping .
It is unavoidable . Sometimes it is pleasant , and sometimes it 's not .
I often shop with no problems , but on Saturday it is not the same .
The shops are so crowded and it takes a long time to find what we want and what we need .
Also we have to face a long queue in order to pay .
It is tiring for some people to spend long hours shopping .
Usually we spend much more money than we expect .
We ca n't do anything about it .
We have to face it - it has both sides .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not every day .
I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply about the camp .
Another consideration was accommodation .
I would like to choose painting , which I have been doing for 12 years , and tennis .
I would be grateful if you could phone me or send me a letter again at your earliest convenience .
Woods is thought to stand for all white people and this book could have an influence on them .
In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he did n't approve of the government 's attitude towards them .
Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist . In other words , he became an activist for the black people of South Africa .
Dear Ms. Ryan , I am writing to you in reply to your letter .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July , because it is summer , and there will be nice weather to enjoy in California .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because I am allergic to some insects that might get in a tent .
As regards the activities , I would enjoy tennis , because I have some experience playing , and my spin and volley are very good , and painting , because I have learnt some techniques that I would like to put into practice .
Lastly , I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes , and where I can change my money to American dollars cheaply .
I would to like ask for your prompt reply , so I can start organizing myself . Thanking you , Yours sincerely , Carmen Dolores Rossell
I hope you are doing fine . I am writing this letter to tell you about my experience helping organise a pop concert .
Firstly , you need to know what you are doing .
I spent two weeks preparing the stage , speakers , backdrop , microphones , everything , with all the staff , and every night the artists came to rehearse their show . I could see how they really improved , and how nice they were with the staff .
The day of the concert , everyone , including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired . However , when the concert started , we saw that all our efforts had been worthwhile . The crew and artists thanked the staff .
I could see the staff , managers , artists and even the director , all as a big team , working together .
That was what made it really special .
I am writing this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called " Over the rainbow " with my wife and children . We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one .
You should have at least informed the public because most of the people there came to see him .
However , the man who took his place gave a good performance , we enjoyed listening to him because his voice was amazing .
The time was not respected : the show began 45 minutes late .
Furthermore you did not apologise , as if it was usual !
Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people had been coming .
But I think that if you took more care of the public , your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive .
The ways we travel are improving a lot at present .
Cars are really useful and a lot faster than walking or cycling .
But cars create pollution : for example the greenhouse effect .
But it is also technology which tries to resolve this problem with new means of transport such as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities .
Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences like medicine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live longer .
I think there is a link between technology and the sciences because they need each other : the sciences discover technologies and technologies make new research in the sciences possible .
Technology also improved communications with the phone of course and also with the Internet .
Every evening when I come back home I go on the Internet .
I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for information I need for my studies .
In my opinion it 's a lot better than the dictionary because it 's faster and you really find what you need .
Technology is necessary to our society but I think it could also be dangerous if we do n't use it in a good way .
I am writing to you about an enjure that I had at your last musical at the Circle Theatre .
First of all , I was surprised that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not perform .
Nobody told us why they were n't there .
I read in your advertisement in Friday 's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the performance started at 20.15 .
I was waiting 45 minutes for nothing !
I am a student and I did n't get a discount ticket .
I do n't understand the problem between your advertisement and the reality .
And finally , after the show , I wanted to have a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed !
As mentioned in the newspaper , I did n't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money .
Yours sincerely
My life changes every day because of modern technology .
For example , if I do n't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework , I go on the Internet and ask for what I need .
From my point of view , the Internet is the most important invention of the 2000 century . You can book tickets for the theatre , sport , etc .
, you can find all the information you need for yourself .
I use the Internet all the time for my homework and in the future , I hope , I will be able to use it for my own work .
Technology will not stop growing and helping people in the future .
It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London , since several things did n't work out as promised in your advertisement .
First of all , there were no discounts available , and having paid Â£ 20 I had to wait 45 minutes longer than expected since the show began at 20:15 and not at 19:30 .
As a second point , the actor was not Danny Brook , as advertised , but someone else I 've never heard of before .
His acting and singing were horrible .
Finally , after all these disappointments , I was not able to have dinner in your theatre restaurant .
It was closed for some reason I still do n't know .
Therefore , I would like to ask for at least half of my money back .
Pat was a teacher of English as a foreign language .
Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have revised for it in advance .
And always , everybody did it surprisingly well .
What was the reason ? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick , when he had finished it , to get his opinion .
Nick then took a copy of the test to file it .
And Nick 's girlfriend happened to be in Pat 's class .
She was quite clever and had known everything about this , so she had made copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared .
It was n't the first time I saw this show in your theatre , but it was the worst one .
At first it was a great pleasure for me to get a ticket because I 'm one of Danny Brook 's greatest fans .
It 's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had chosen it , because I 'm ( allowed ? ) .
When the musical started at 20:15 ( not at 19:30 as advertised ) I was really shocked when I realised that a different actor was playing his role .
I could n't stay any longer and had to leave the theatre .
You have to know that I am very sick because of my blood pressure and so I was laying down the whole weekend .
In my opinion it 's simple for you to pay me back the money I spent .
Otherwise I have to contact my lawyer .
I am waiting to hear from you .
For me , as a scientist , it 's a big problem to show how the innovations of the last century went up with the environment and nature .
In the past new technologies were mostly followed by ground- , water- or air pollution .
Nowadays a simple thing like a computer includes so many possible ways of destroying different environmental compartments .
On the one hand there are the materials from which the PCs are made , on the other hand is the huge waste problem .
Now I try to show , in my daily work , how the airborn chlororganics , which are degased from plastics , will be separated and damaged by green plants .
Sometimes it seems to me like a joke if I think about all the dangerous materials I need to do my job .
Nevertheless , in my opinion , the only way to find a better way of living with nature is to check out the problems we have .
Therefore it makes sense to use the innovations which are causing environmental destruction .
I am writing to answer your letter , which I received yesterday .
First of all , I would like to thank you for accepting me and I am very appreciative that all expenses are paid .
I can travel only in July because my exams will be finished at the beginning of that month and it would be great if I could set off on my journey on 15th July .
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy , according to the forecast .
I have been playing them for more than 3 years , during which I have been trained , 3 years for tennis , 1 year for golf , by professional coaches .
I enjoy playing both of them regularly .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me the address at which I am going to stay , so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
In my opinion , shopping is not suitable for children whose ages are under 18 !
This is quite a strong opinion , but I know it from my real - life experiences of shopping .
When I was 15 , I was starting to look for new clothes , shoes , and everything I would find now unnecessary .
I would not dare to calculate how much I have spent on those things without thinking .
However , it was not bad . My mum always told me that I had n't earned enough money so I should n't have spent it in the wrong way .
Therefore , people who are over 18 can think of more reasons than young children can for shopping and buying such tempting objects .
To sum up , shopping is not a bad thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know why you are spending it !
I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place on the 21 and 22 November .
In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good , I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the excellent quality of the music .
I really enjoyed the plays and films . I wonder if there will be more next year ?
Finally , I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably priced ticket for the weekend is excellent . We can go where we want to , see what we feel like seeing .
However , I think the weekend is really too short .
May I suggest you think about doing the festival over a week .
As you asked me in it , here are some of the school and home rules in my country , France .
First of all , and I think it 's very different in England , children do n't wear uniforms at school .
Of course when you 're in class you have to behave yourself and be polite with the teacher and the other schoolchildren .
During the break , usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you .
I think nowadays , children are more free and heard . I mean as regards the contact between them and adults .
Usually they know what they 're allowed to do or not and if they do n't respect it , the teacher not only punishes them ( though not always ) but also speaks with them .
At home it is different . Each family has its own rules .
As far as I am concerned , when I was a child , I was not allowed to stay up very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired .
But I was a clever child . So !
There are some rules , like " do n't speak with a full mouth " ; " do n't put your finger in your nose " ; " say please and thank you " ; " do n't fight with your brother " ; and so on , but I think it 's the same everywhere .
First of all , I want to thank you for this prize .
I have never been to the USA , so I think that this trip will be an unforgettable experience .
Secondly , I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school .
After August I must return to school , so I can only go to California in July .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like nature very much , and camping , so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin .
Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting , I prefer swimming and tennis . I think that I am very good at swimming .
I am not so good at tennis because I began to play only two years ago .
Finally , I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and what kind of clothes I have to wear .
Furthermore , I would like to know the money I have to take and what amount of money is normally spent in the camp .
I look forward to receiving your reply .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue pair of trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It can be a very stressful situation because sometimes you do n't know what to say .
In my opinion shopping could be a ' dangerous ' activity because you may spend more money on some clothes than you can afford . I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping .
Despite shopping being boring , I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several items of clothing and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment .
First , thank you for your programme .
It is very varied and interesting .
We all like it .
But last week we saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
This presentation will show the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear .
We would be very interested in seeing English fashion .
At this show we could see different new make - up and hairstyles .
For practical information , this show starts at 10.00 and closes at 19.00 .
It will be in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
It is not too far and the opening hours suit us .
About the programme , we suggest seeing the show on the Tuesday morning and afterwards going shopping .
As far as we are concerned , we prefer to see the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery .
We also suggest visiting the Science Museum on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon , if some of us are interested , we could see the National Art Gallery .
I hope you wo n't be too angry about this change but we would all like to go to the show .
Waiting for your answer , receive our greetings .
On behalf of the class
Generally speaking , homes will change considerably .
They will become less dark and more comfortable than today .
People 's homes will be built more economically by using natural energy like solar or wind energy .
These improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and non - renewable energy .
About the size of houses , I think that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation .
We will also see very tall buildings which contain a lot of narrow flats .
In contrast , in the suburbs or in the countryside , more and more rich people will build big houses .
Homes like this will be built with the latest technologies and will be very luxurious .
But about the differences between the homes of the rich and poor they , will be the same in the future .
I think that people will be as alone and jealous as today .
I am writing to complain about a musical I went to one week ago .
Firstly , I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing for personal reasons . I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him .
Moreover , the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 , making all the audience wait for nearly an hour .
To make matters worse , there were no discounts on tickets such as you advertised .
Because of this I had to buy a ticket for the cheapest and worst seat available .
As if this were not enough , once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for maintenance .
I , therefore , request an immediate refund of the Â£ 10 I spent on your musical as I believe your theatre is directly to blame .
Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer . I did n't pay attention to it then but as as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games .
The years went by and after buying a newer , faster and better PC I found myself writing letters , doing homework and in the evening learning with my Computer .
In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk to them , I kept on , stuck in front of the screen .
After I got connected to the Internet my life completely changed .
Dear Mr. Robertson :
First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks for the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon .
After reading the whole organized programme , we all agreed about the sightseeing tour by bus around London , which will give us the knowledge of this fantastic city we have all wanted to have since a long time ago .
The main purpose of our letter is to explain about the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
We found the advertisement in a local newspaper and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity , because the show consists of these topics :
Make - up . Hairstyles .
After discussing this , we want to suggest how we think the programme should be re - arranged .
Instead of going to the science museum , we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which is open on Tuesday , March 14 , from 10 am to 7 pm .
After that we could continue our trip as it has been arranged already .
Yours sincerely
The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie - Agatha Christie .
Agatha Christie has always been my favourite writer .
Not only because she 's famous and wrote lots of books , but she knows how to introduce characters and how to tell a good story us though deceiving the readers .
One of her most interesting and famous works is a novel called " The Orient Express " .
In other words the story is set on a train which takes a trip along the orient .
On the train , all the passengers seem to be involved in a crime .
This is such a fascinating story and it 's the way Agatha Christie tells it .
The mystery is drawn out until the last page of the book .
It has been a fabulous experience so if anybody would like to read a good detective story , try reading Agatha Christie 's detective story and you wo n't regret it at all .
I 'm terribly sorry but I have to inform you about a very disappointing evening .
I 'm sure you 'll read this letter with the intention of explaining the problems I had during the musical show at your theatre .
One of the causes of my disappointment was the substitute actor that played in the show .
I like Danny Brook very much , and his unexpected absence caused me great sadness .
Then , the musical show had to start at 19,30 .. why was the light on at 20:15 ? You 'll agree with me that 45 minutes waiting for the start of the show is too long a time .
The advertisement for the show indicated discounts available and an open restaurant after the show but it was n't like that .
The restaurant was closed because of illness .. whose ?
It 's a strange thing !
Greetings
It 's for this reason that I 'm now in this terrible situation .
I ca n't believe she said that I was at Maria 's party and , because I was distracted , I told Pat that I had lost Jon 's shirt .
I had agreed to buy another one , of the same style , but now he 's angry with me , because I did n't say anything to him .
I do n't know what to do .
He 's my best friend and so he wanted all the truth from me I could give him .
It 's all right , but I also think that he 's exaggerating .
I do n't think I have done such a bad thing as to destroy our friendship .
I like his company , and we are happy when we are together .
I ca n't finish with him because of a girl who ca n't keep a simple secret .
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " , PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO ; FIRST OF ALL , I READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW , BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS A DIFFERENT ONE , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING .
AS REGARDS THE TICKETS , I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE , BUT IT WAS NOT SO , AND I HAD TO PAY THE FULL PRICE .
MOREOVER , AFTER THE SHOW , I INTENDED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT , BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT .
FINALLY , YOU PROMISED IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT ; AS IT WAS NOT SO , I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT DEVELOPS ; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES ( AND IS CREATED BY ) DESIGNERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD , EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY , SOMETIMES ONE THE OPPOSITE OF ANOTHER .
I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOP ALONG VERY DIFFERENT LINES : THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST , AS WE CAN NOTICE NOW , OR A MORE FANTASTIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT .
SURELY , ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV . AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE , I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON COMFORT MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE .
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD , IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE , THAT IS A TOO VARIED A CATEGORY .
I am only available in July because I am studying at an engineering school and I 'll work until the end of June .
You asked me which type of accommodation I would prefer between a tent and a log cabin .
I am used to spending summer holidays in a tent and I like it , but why not try a log cabin ?
I would be very pleased if I could do tennis and surfing .
In fact , I soon play tennis and I am quite good at it , and it will be an opportunity to train . Surfing is completely new to me and I hope that I will like it .
Finally , I want to know if I need any money and how much , and if there is a dry cleaners .
We all know what shopping is .
When you go to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that , you look for it but it 's not there anymore .
Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there are too many people .
But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have all your time ( the girls know what it is ) . Finally , when it 's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable , but most of the time it is n't enjoyable !
First of all , I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote to me asking for my preferences about the Camp .
Regarding the information you need , I have to tell you that I can only go in July , for work reasons .
Once there , I would prefer staying in a tent , because that is a way to remember my childhood as a Boy Scout and get a break from the routine .
From the list of activities you sent me , I have chosen what are the , from my point of view , most relaxing activities available : painting and photography .
One of my hobbies is photography , so I think I am rather good at it , but I will take painting to learn , because I am not very talented at it .
I also would like to know if I have to take any money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location .
Please reply me soon .
When I knew this , I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepare the stage before the concert .
The day of the show I worked so hard that I could n't see the show .
And I did n't even get paid .
But it was worth it .
I got my reward when the concert finished .
After carrying stuff like lights , microphones , wires and some other equipment for about three hours , I was exhausted .
But when Britney came off the stage , she passed by me , saw my tired face and invited me into her personal dressing room .
Write to me soon to tell me your thoughts about what happened to me .
I received your letter this morning and I 'm very happy about winning first prize .
It 's a great opportunity for me to participate in your Camp California because normally I work a lot and I ca n't spend money on travel . Moreover , I have to support a big family because I 'm married and I have three children .
I would like to travel in July because before then I have to work with my father because he 's ill .
For the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because it 'll be more comfortable .
I know that I would like to sleep in a tent but at this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it 's better for me to sleep in a bed .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
I have to choose painting and photography therefore . I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think of my health .
In your letter you explain that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life on Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money .
I hope the weather will be good so I suppose I have to bring short clothes .
I 'm very enthusiastic and I wait for your answer as soon is possible .
In our society money is one of the most important aspect to have power .
If we think about it , we will realise that we need money all day .
Not only for the basic needs but also for the rest of our activities .
Sometimes , they have to buy something that they need but , frequently , they buy things only to spend money .
This is a big problem because a lot of families do n't have money to spend going shopping .
We have to teach our children the value of money , to explain the difficulties of earning money in a job , because we have to work eight , nine or ten hours a day , for example .
Educating the youngest is a first step and helps our society .
Money is important but we have to know how to spend it : shopping is not always enjoyable .
I'M WRITING TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK , WHEN I WENT TO THE CIRCLE THEATRE AND I SAW " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
FIRST OF ALL , IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENT YOU SAID THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE , BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM AVAILABLE ANYWHERE .
THE PLAY STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT : FORTY - FIVE MINUTES LATE .
HAD HE BEEN IN A PLAY BEFORE ?
I DON'T KNOW THE REASON WHY ...
AS YOU CAN SEE , IT WASN'T A " PERFECT EVENING " .
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A FULL REFUND .
MY ADDRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE . I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE .
UNFORTUNATELY , PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS .... AND WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THAT MARIA WAS GOING OUT WITH TIM ( A CLASSMATE ) , SHE TOLD EVERYONE SHE MET .
WITHIN A FEW DAYS MARIA 'S FATHER ( WHO IS VERY JEALOUS ) HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR .
HE GOT VERY ANGRY AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW MARIA TO GO OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS .
MARIA TALKED TO HER FATHER AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT TIM IS A GOOD PERSON BUT HER FATHER SAYS THAT SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND .
WHEN MARIA COULD GO OUT SHE TOLD HER FRIENDS WHAT PAT HAD DONE .
NOW NOBODY TELLS HER ANYTHING .
HER FATHER ACCEPTED HIM AFTER A WHILE .
I am very happy that I have won the first prize in your competition .
I am looking forward to my holiday which , begins on the first of July lasting until twenty - first July , so it is possible to travel at this time .
I like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since I have done military service , therefore I would prefer a tent as my accommodation .
My favourite activities are swimming and singing .
It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overweight .
I like to sing a song when I am alone .
Singing is good for my emotion .
So I choose singing and swimming as my activities .
I am a beginner at swimming and also at singing .
Can you tell me what clothes I should take with me for which two weeks .
What kind of weather do you have at this time of year ?
Do I need a lot of money etc . for the different excursions
Yours sincerely
What does it mean , the word " shopping " ? I live and I need different products to survive .
I need things to drink and eat . That is the basic fact that means I must go shopping for food .
It is not enjoyable to see that the price of food is going higher and higher .
My salary is getting lower and lower .
When I have enough money the price is n't important , then I can buy a lot of things without considering my money .
Despite having enough money , shopping is not always enjoyable , because I do n't know which things I will buy in the future .
Also I will buy things which I do n't need .
There are many products the quality of which is bad and because of this the environmental pollution will increase more and more .
It is a fact that shopping is not enjoyable .
I am writing to let you know about the unbelievable experiences which we had when we went to the theatre to see the musical show ' OVER THE RAINBOW . '
First of all , I am a fan of Danny Brook but he was absent because he was sick .
It disappointed me very much .
Secondly , although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre , we could not be given any discounts only because we had booked at a travel agency .
Finally , I am going to write about the theatre , the Circle Theatre .
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
It was your fault .
We would like you to return the price of the ticket and pay us for that hotel as well .
I would recommend you show that the restaurant is closed on Monday .
If you asked the young people what they spend their money on most , most of them would answer ' clothes ' .
These days , new fashions pass by very quickly .
In my opinion , young people tend to wear clothes which can show their skin .
For example , short skirts and tops like underwear .
I think young people would wear smaller clothes which make them look like they are almost naked even in winter .
It could be that people will wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear , like skirts made of leaves .
Next , I predict about patterns of clothes .
The animal - pattern is catching on now .
It might be possible that the fish - pattern will catch on in 100 years .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the three - day programme .
Thank you very much for your excellent programme , and especially for the visit to The National Art Gallery .
It starts on Tuesday March 14 and we can go there instead of visiting the Science Museum or going shopping .
Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have some free time .
So at this show there will be the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and even hairstyles .
All our class and I would like to see this show .
We do n't need to pay . It 's free because we are students .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast - developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rarely .
I think you 'll agree that we have changed your programme .
As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having some free time .
I 'm looking forward to receiving a letter from you .
Bye
We ca n't say for certain how people 's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and create incredible things about life in the future .
Of course there will be differences between today 's homes and future ones .
I think houses will grow from twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy them .
I think more and more people will have at least one flat ; it wo n't matter if you are rich or not .
The rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion , where there will be less furniture and everything will be compact . Even TV - sets will be on the ceiling .
The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now , and you will have up to twenty rooms in your own flat , and even be able to switch on the light by saying simply : " Light " .
If course if you have enough money to let yourself live in such an apartment , then you can afford it .
Now what 's going to be the same ?
Well as I said , if you 're poor , the government will still give you a flat but a very ugly one , probably with rats in it .
The same problem will be with homeless people who do n't have money at all , even to buy food for themselves .
They will have to stay on the streets as the streets are their home .
I hope and I wish that the future will bring us good moments in life where everybody will have a home and warm , friendly family relationships .
Last week , I went to London , to your theatre to see " Over the rainbow " and I had a disappointing evening .
The problems were : firstly , the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were n't there in your show , I was unhappy to constat that there were different actors that evening .
Secondly , the 19:30 show only started at 20:15 ; thirdly , your advertisement said : " Discounts available " ; but it was n't the case .
Fourth , the restaurant was closed for renovation and you should n't have proposed we go .
As you can see , I 'm very disappointed about this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money .
That 's why I ask you to give me my money back .
I ask you to give me Â£ 20 , back by cheque .
Technology is the future , and the present .
For instance , the Internet .
The whole world is now connected by it .
The Internet is the " new " revolution of communications and knowledge .
The Internet has existed for ten years now , but we only used to use it for army and government purposes .
Now , everybody who works in a commercial company uses the Internet every day .
Technology also means all electrical machines , which do n't stop being developed .
Another example , computers , every six months something better is invented .
Modern technology has changed my daily life every day .
For instance , meat - we do n't cook our meals , everything is already done .
Five minutes in the microwave and it 's ready .
Machines have replaced the work of humans .
Every day we use technological machines without knowing .
Our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on their development .
I write you this letter because I want to tell you about my experiences at the festival .
I spent two days at the " International Arts Festival " and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time .
For example , on the leaflet it was written that there would be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries .
Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough room for everyone and you could not enjoy anything !
It was a small offer ; I hope it will be larger the next time .
There were also very good events like the dance shows , the art exhibition and the talks given by writers .
This was a clever way to attract people
Last , I would like to suggest a " pony - ride " for children , to attract families .
Please tell me your opinion about this .
I think there are some opportunities for earning money .
I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils , for example , in maths or English .
Teaching pupils is not easy , of course .
But I think that after a few lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff .
So it will be easier for the teacher then !
Also it is not dirty work . I mean you do not have to clean rooms or other people 's toilets !
And you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers , as you would if you were working in a shop .
To be a good teacher you especially need patience and good nerves !
And the money you get is not less
So , if you like to be with people and help them and if you have the talent to explain things well then it would be best if you offered your help to the people !
Dear Helen Ryan : Thank you for letting me know about my prize trip to Camp California in the USA .
Here I will answer all the questions that you asked me , and I will ask you about other things that you did n't mention .
I 'd like to organize my trip for July because that is when I have vacations , also because it is summertime in the U.S.A . About accommodation at Camp I 'd prefer a tent , because it 's a new experience for me and I 'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure .
In my free time I like to play golf and swim , so I think that I 'm good at playing golf .
I play every Saturday and Sunday , and after that , I usually go to the pool because I love swimming . I think that those are the sports I would like to do at the Camp .
Helen , I would like to ask you how much money we have to take to the Camp ?
What kind of clothing do we have take ?
Thank you very much for your cooperation .
Yours sincerely Teresa Reina
Most of the time when we go to the shopping centre we have a lot of fun . We go to stores to look at clothing , we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries , but is not enjoyable all the time .
Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not good company , we do n't have a great time , or when we know what we want to buy , but when we get to the store they do n't have what we want , in that instance we need to shop also when is an important day like Father 's day or Christmas everywhere we want to go and buy something it is very crowded so we ca n't find what we are looking for calmly because everybody is pushing you in the other direction to the one you want
In that instance we do n't enjoy shopping because we ca n't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping centre .
First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your concern about your customers .
I was absolutely thrilled to receive the news about my winning a competition .
Your letter contains a few questions about the details of my holiday which I would like to answer for you .
The first is about time .
I am only able to go on holiday in July , because for the rest of the time I have college , which I ca n't miss .
I would rather stay in log cabins than live in tents .
I do n't like cold nights and mosquitoes .
I am so glad that I will get a chance to do activities in the camp .
I play basketball and tennis .
I am quite good at tennis .
What about basketball is .
I played in the school team , and was one of the best players by the end of this season .
It is regarding clothes and money .
Should I have any special clothes ? If yes what kind of clothing it is .
Can you inform me how much money I should have and can I have some information about prices of visiting local places of interest .
Finally I would like once more to say thanks for your letter and I look forward to hearing from you by post with all the details about the holiday .
Yours faithfully
I hate shopping but on the other hand sometimes you can have fun doing it .
In my opinion , it depends on your mood , your financial situation , of course , where you are going to go shopping and what you are going to buy .
Usually people do n't have time for shopping .
You 've just finished your long hours at work , you are tired , you had a row with your boss but you are still going to go shopping .
And what do you have ?
There are huge queues to the tills , noise , hassle , poor customer service .
You 've got more stress , you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought .
For example , a lot of people do not like to go shopping in big stores .
There are so many varieties of products , different prices , different qualities .
You will have to walk miles around the store to find what you want .
Yes , there is a big plus with a big store of course .
You can find everything in one place , in contrast to the small shops which specialise in one product .
And people spend all weekend walking around shopping centres and high streets in trills to buy something .
Nowadays technical progress gets close to us , to normal customers .
The Internet is one of the solutions to this problem .
Without any hassle , sitting in your chair in front of your computer , in a second you can get to any shop that has an internet site - most of the big companies have one - get all the information about the product , get a cheaper price and buy it .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning the competition .
I am writing to inform you of my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I can only take my holiday in July . I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July .
I know that staying in a log cabin is more convenient but I just want to have a wilder experience .
While I am at the camp , I would like to take part in swimming and photography .
It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy the fresh air .
Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take as many nice photos as I can in the camp area .
And I want to know how much money I have to bring for personal expenses .
I also want to know if I can have time for shopping .
I have just received your letter which made me so happy . I am writing to reply to your questions .
First of all , I can travel only in July because my son 's school is going to finish at the end of June , so it is impossible for me to travel during June .
Apart from that , I work in an international tourism agency and August is the busiest month of the year , so July is the best choice for me .
I would rather stay in a tent because I used to go camping when I was a teenager with my family .
I took some lessons and after that I really improved .
Besides this , I am very good at playing basketball .
I used to play in the high school team .
Could you please give me some information about it and what kind of clothes I should bring for my holiday .
Besides , I really would like to know approximately how much money I should take with me .
I hope all this information will help you .
I am so sorry that I could n't write to you last week .
As you know , I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked at as a director 's assistant during the last week .
First of all , it was a very successful concert and probably you have heard the singer 's name before , she is called Tina .
As a director 's assistant , my job was the organisation of the audience 's seats and tickets .
All seats were brought from a sponsor company .
Every day I worked for two hours in a shop selling tickets .
It was quite enjoyable because every day I met different people who like listening to pop music so we had lots of things to talk about .
I also helped with some special requests of the singer which were n't so difficult to arrange .
On the night of the concert , I worked as well .
After the concert , I was absolutely exhausted but the thing is I will never forget this experience .
The best thing was of course meeting Tina .
We promised each other to keep in touch and she has invited me to her next concert !
So , that 's all my news .
Write back soon .
Dear Helen
I have never been to the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California .
I can only have some holiday in July from the 3rd to the 17th with my husband at the same time . That is why I would like to travel during those two weeks .
For the accommodation I would prefer to have a tent because I am used to staying on campsites and I love it during summer , just to change the customs ! !
Concerning the activities , I have chosen two of them .
I enjoy swimming and any time I have the opportunity to swim I go .
My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that it is better to do one sport and one " soft leisure " and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I am unfamiliar with during my holidays .
Please could you tell me about the weather , if I need special clothes and about how to change my money , if you do n't mind ?
Yours sincerely ,
" Shopping is not always enjoyable " " Shopping today ! " If you decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a " shopping destination " , that means that you need something special for yourself or someone else . You have the money and the time that you want .
Save some money to go shopping in Paris or Roma and see how the French or Italian fashion looks on you ! And after that you can visit the duty - free shops and buy some cheap souvenirs .
Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping , and it is really nice to go there with enough money to buy what you always wanted to .
But even if shopping can means dream it can be boring sometimes .
If you have no money and a friend asks you to go shopping , it should be boring ! And you may become jealous of him and want him to do it quickly ! Or you may get irritable !
And you can find that there are too many people in the shops , it is too hot or you can not get the right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry ! Or you decide not to spend the money shopping today , but in front of the shop .
So , you 'd better stay at home today ...
Dear Madam and Sir
I am writing to you about your production : ' over the rainbow ' .
It was another actor who played very badly .
Secondly , the musical should start at 19.30 , but we had to wait until 20.15 !
It was boring that nothing happened for such a long time on the stage .
Why do you write things on your advertisement that are not true ?
And finally , I would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought I would go to ' Theatre restaurant ' .
But how could I , it was closed !
There are too many negative points for one evening .
I am afraid that I want my money back .
I hope you do not disappoint me on this point .
Yours faithfully
This is not a taboo subject with me and my friends .
We have discussed it a lot of times .
I had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different .
I think it is very difficult to change clothes and fashion so much again .
We have so many kinds of clothes and fashions from our old generations .
Maybe , the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter , the shoes more modern so that you can not walk in them anymore .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on Mars and then they will have to wear other kinds of clothes .
But I do n't think these clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth .
I am very happy and excited because I have won first prize in your competition .
I am writing to enquire about some doubts and to give the information that you need about me .
I have been working hard here in Portugal and I will be on holiday just next July .
Because of this I believe this is the best time for to me travel You asked me about accommodation at Camp California .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I suppose I will have more contact with natural things than in a log cabin .
I would love to play tennis and basketball , which I 've been playing for six years .
About tennis , I just started to play last year and I need to improve my technique a lot .
Are they included in the prize ?
How much money can I spend during this time ?
I 'd prefer it if you gave me this information as soon as you can .
I am looking forward to hearing from you
I 'm really excited and I have to tell you about a fantastic experience that I had last month .
I suppose you know about the " Portugal Pop Concert " that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month , do n't you ?
I worked as a receptionist in the VIP room and I needed to look very happy all the time , which was n't very difficult .
You wo n't believe how many famous people I met .
It was a dream and she was amazing with me .
I did n't tell you , but I helped at this concert just by chance .
A friend of mine gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressful situations .
However , those days were unforgettable for me .
Hope to hear from you soon
I have just received your letter in which you inform me that I won the first prize of two weeks at Camp California .
I would like to travel in July , since I am studying and that is the only month I have on vacation .
Fortunately , I have heard that the weather is beautiful in California during that month .
I 'd rather sleep in a tent because I want to enjoy this wild experience !
Could you please tell me what kind of clothes you recommend for camping ?
Cordially yours ,
The best way to go shopping is to think in advance about what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend .
The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under pressure or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives .
It may seem relaxing at the beginning , but if they take their credit cards with them , the stress will increase when they have to pay the bills ! !
Wait for a sunny day , take a look at your wardrobe , some money , ask a friend to go with you , and enjoy an exciting shopping trip !
I will be very happy to travel in July because in that month I am going to have my holidays , so I will not have to ask permission from my boss .
At the same time , my birthday is in July , so it would be nice to celebrate it there .
I would prefer to stay in a tent , because in that way I can feel closer to nature , and I can remember when I was a girl scout .
Sleeping in a tent is much more exciting and clousy than in a log cabin .
At the camp I would like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing . I love painting . At university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint because I work in a bank and I have a baby .
So I will be very happy to improve my art at the camp .
The reason for my choice of singing is that I feel embarrassed about my voice , so maybe I could improve it .
I would like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenirs .
Thank you for giving me this opportunity .
You are never going to believe what I did last month . I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus , when suddenly a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour .
We said yes immediately . I nearly shouted with happiness when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert . He is my favourite singer .
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage , doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there .
We were so close to him . I did n't have the chance to talk with him but I do n't mind . I will never forget that day .
Since then , I and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day .
I hope you write to me soon to tell me your opinion .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " that has been performed in the Circle Theatre .
As I was very anxious to see that show , I planned to go to the theatre on my last holiday , and I am completely disappointed with it .
First of all , I have to say that the advertisement promised something totally different from what I saw there .
For example , the actors that were announced as taking part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , the discounts were not available and , the principal point : it started forty - five minutes late .
I wonder if you could explain to me why .
Due to my huge dissatisfaction , I would like my money back , as you do not provide what was advertised .
Every day , the growth of modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody 's life .
The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good things into my life , like the potential to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image on my cab TV and on my computer .
On the other hand , the excess of convenience can lead us , in the future , to a completely " cold " world , because of the distance that can be created between people .
Other bad points can be mentioned , like pollution for example .
Despite the bad things that modern technology can bring , in my opinion , if the governments tried to do their best , and if everybody contributed a little bit , we could solve the main problems and only take advantage of the benefits to our lives .
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show , where everything was completely different from the advertisement .
To begin my complaint I might start with the actor - who was a different one to the one advertised , not Danny Brook .
Tina Truelove performed marvellously , but him , I think he is a " street actor " from Covent Garden .
Even worse was the delay . The Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , which drove me mad .
I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for a discount ticket . I could not get it , it was really unfair . I paid the normal price .
Also there was another problem . I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show , I could not , it was closed because it was being refurbished and redecorated .
Anyway , I expected to have a perfect evening out , however , I just had a terrible time , everything went wrong .
The only thing to do is : to compensate me , send me my money back . I am sending my ticket for that . Hope you 'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further .
The twenty - first century - technology , technology , and technology .
Modern life has been full of science and technology .
I am very pleased that I was born in a time when there is such good technology but my parents did n't have the same luck .
My life is much easier with all this stuff mentioned above - technology and science .
Computers have changed people 's lives . Many of them can work from home , they do n't need to go to their offices .
The Internet is very handy , you can shop , send e - mail messages , or even have sex , which is really funny .
There is an ambiguity about technology - it can create good things and terrible things as well .
One good side is it makes life easier - computers , mobile phones , vending machines , etc ....
The bad side is can we use technology for war - missiles , weapons , etc ....
Indeed technology has changed our lives , we have become more sceptical and cold .
I believe that people should take just good advantages that .
Sometimes I think technology is not a good thing ....
I have read the letter and I was very surprised that I have won the first prize .
About the time when I want to travel it can only be in July , because in the summer it is very busy at work .
People whom I work with are going on holiday in June and August .
So they need me at work in those months .
Also , the accommodation I would prefer at Camp California is the log cabin , because first when I was a little child we stayed in a small house every holiday and I like that .
Second , I do n't like tents and I ca n't get used to them , so I prefer log cabins .
About the different activities , we like them all , but If I have to choose two I opt for sailing and tennis .
In the summer I 'm sailing in races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes .
I 'm not very good at tennis but I can practise on my trip .
What things must I pay for on my trip ?
Everything is fine with me and the pop concert was great .
I enjoyed helping at the pop concert , but it 's very stressful work .
You always walk from side to side moving things and there 's no break .
Some other work that I did was to lead the people to their places .
We worked the whole day and luckily at least we had some food .
The best things were that we saw famous singers and I spoke with Robbie Williams .
He 's friendly and very handsome of course .
If you see the famous singers in the flesh they are different and most singers haven't any time for you .
Another thing I did was the make - up but only for about fifteen minutes .
That was very nice , because I did n't expect that .
There were some people who gave me some advice about cleaning the face etc .
Finally , it was a very nice day and a great experience .
Love
Firstly , I would like to travel in July , because before then I do n't have time to travel .
I have to finish my studies .
Secondly , I want to stay in a log cabin .
And I would like to have a chance to do painting and photography .
I am not so fit and healthy , so I do n't like to do exercise .
However , drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me .
I hope so very much .
Do you like shopping ?
Generally many women like shopping , including me .
However , whenever you go shopping , are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy shopping ?
Perhaps you have an unpleasant experience .
Then you could find the cheapest goods and in that case , you probably buy it needlessly .
Moreover if you bought something then you could find it is a little bit more expensive than the other shop .
Both cases often happen with shopping .
If you do n't want to regret shopping , you have to make a shopping list first before going shopping .
Then you should check the price and the quality of the goods .
One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are only going window shopping .
I have recently been to London on holiday so I decided to spend my free time going to the musical show you were advertising .
It seemed very attractive and the information on the ad pushed me into going to it .
I 'm not keen on liars , Mr Smith , and I think that you 've lied to naive tourists like us : some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different , pitiful ones .
Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed by forty - five minutes .
I ought not to talk about the restaurant which was , closed for no apparent reasons
You had promised a perfect evening but I spent a horrible one there and you ruined my holiday !
What do you take us for , Mr Smith ?
We did not deserve such a bad show .
Otherwise I 'll have to put some other ads out in London saying that your show is just a fraud !
To begin with , I 'd like to underline how the importance of technology has increased in a couple of years .
With the end of the Second world war and the beginning of economic prosperity , many goods like TVs , washing machines , etc . became cheaper and more available .
Nowadays , the Internet and the mobile phone , with the development of satellite , communication seem to take the lead .
As far as I am concerned , the first way modern technology influences me is through my work : the Internet has become such an incredible tool , I can research into everything I want , find information for lectures , for example , or exercises .
Nevertheless , new technology has made me more lazy .
I spend a lot of my free time watching TV , or surfing on the Internet or playing on the computer .
Maybe it will change me into a kind of self - centred person , a loner .
But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in the way I communicate .
But we should not forget that they are only tools and should emphasise human relationships .
You have sent me a letter about the competition and the first prize I have won .
You asked me for some further information .
First , I 'd like to travel in July at any time from the first to the 30th because of my vacation period . I 'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare myself .
Second , I 'd prefer to have a log cabin where I could store some things .
Finally , I 'd like to play tennis and to try climbing .
Is any ability required ?
Could you send me a note about travelling in California which could help me ?
This book remains one of the best in American literature .
It is classed as one of the ten books that should be in your own library .
But it is also the most famous short story by Ernest Hemingway .
Based on a very simple story , the story of an old man fishing , it is a deep reflection on age .
A veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men that he is still able to do it .
Then , Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing and of the great fight between the fish and the old man .
The 24-hour fight is described in such a peaceful , faithful way that it callas a though about life and death .
I recommend this book as a way to discover both Hemingway and American literature .
Before answering your letter ( which I have just received ) about the prize for the competition I recently won , I 'd like to say thank you very much for giving me the chance of going to the USA .
I have been asked to say when I would like to travel .
About the accommodation , I think I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent , since it is more comfortable .
During my two weeks at Camp California , I 'd like to practise climbing and surfing , the basics of which I know perfectly well .
I am quite good at both because I do usually practise them .
Furthermore , I love to do such sports !
In addition to this , I would like to know the amount of money I should bring , as well as the kind of clothes that I could need and the sort of people that I will find there .
It has been so long since I wrote to you last time ...
Hey , guess what : I helped a friend at a pop concert !
It was great , and I got my ticket for free !
I agreed unwillingly , as I could n't imagine what a pop concert would be like ... but when I went in I changed my mind !
None of the groups are known at the moment , but I believe they are well on their way to becoming famous bands .
My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff , and staying there after the concert to clean everything .
This was the best part because when everyone was gone , Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners ! ! !
What was a guy like that doing in such a place ?
I could n't believe my eyes ...
Jane took a photograph of us together .
Lots of kisses from
Dear Sir or Madam
I have recently spent a week 's holiday in London , and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain about a couple of things .
First , I would like to complain about the main feature , which is an actor . He might be well known in England , but on the night , he performed abysmally .
Secondly , a lot of people were not very impressed with the delay , because all of us at least had to wait for almost an hour before the show started .
Also , a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities , which were said to be serve in the advertisement .
For example , the discount for the tickets was not available , and in particular a lot of people were disappointed that they could n't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed , due to the cleaner forgetting to clean up the mess from the previous party .
Lastly , I do not think I would call this my perfect evening , so I would like to ask for a refund , and I hope as the Manager of London 's newest theatre , you will handle the situation favourably .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . Although he 's one of my best friends , sometimes , he 's a real pain in the butt .
Pat and I knew each other very well , because we are neighbours , so since we 've met , Pat and I have always got on very well .
We always go to the same school , and he often makes more friends than I do , and every time he introduces me to them .
Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality , he 'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone , even himself .
Although , we are great friends , sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes , and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight . It all started when once I accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house , and there were lady 's knickers inside . I was so nervous and embarrassed , so I told Pat and off he went : he told every single student in the school that I 'd stolen a girl 's knickers , and everyone started to call me a pervert .
Anyway , Pat eventually apologized to me and we are still best mates as ever .
Firstly , there was a different actor / actress whose name I have never heard before .
It was going to start at 19.30 .
After all , I missed my return train after the show .
Thirdly , there was no discount on my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired .
It was a perfectly terrible evening out .
So , I want you to give me my money back .
If you do n't do that , I will tell the public that you are wrong in your advertisement .
Yours sincerely .
When I was a young child , I used to be interested in reading science fiction .
Interestingly , nowadays , I live in the scientific world which I read about in the books .
Probably , I started using a mobile phone 5 years ago .
Before using a mobile - phone , if someone wanted to talk to me immediately , they could n't find where I was .
However , nowadays , it is easy to find me because of the mobile phone .
However , after the appearance the of Internet , I send e - mail to my friends .
It takes just a few minutes to send e - mail to someone .
I just check my e - mail before going to bed every day .
In conclusion , because of modern technology , I 'm very comfortable and can do something efficiently with my computer and mobile phone .
Dear Mrs Ryan
When I received your letter , I was very surprised and happy because I do n't remember entering this competition .
First I can travel only in July because I will finish school at the end of June and I will sit my exam in September ; so I have to revise for it a lot during the month of August .
To answer your second question , I choose to sleep in a tent because I like to sleep outside .
For the activities , I choose the golf and the surfing ( it was n't easy to decide which activities I will do , because almost every choice interested me )
I have tried golf twice . I 'm really bad but I hope to make much progress quickly .
I have never tried surfing , but every time I see surfing on television I find it magical .
How much money will I have to take with me ?
Thanks for everything
I 'm sorry I can only write now because last week I had too much work .
As you asked me I will tell you about the pop concert last month .
With my friend Miko I looked for a little weekend job and one evening we met a guy who wanted to sell drinks at the pop concert and so we told him that we agreed to help him at the bar .
It was a wonderful weekend : we were opposite the singers and we saw every concert without buying any tickets ! ( We were part of the staff of the concert . )
At the end we had 1200 in profit and each of us took 400 for himself
I particularly liked seeing all those people , and I met a lot of new friends there .
For next year we are searching for a new barwoman .
I would like to travel only in July because I would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea 's temperature is less cold than in winter .
I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip , which would be annoying ? !
And when the sun is shining you are relaxed and you feel good .
I would prefer a tent to sleep in at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents and to compare to sleeping it in a house .
You are in communication with nature and you can hear the insects .
It is very nice to stay in tents which are strong and comfortable .
From the list below , the two activities I will choose are tennis and sailing .
Tennis because I play tennis and I am classed 15 - 5 .
I like tennis very much because it is a technical and physical sport .
And you need a strategy to win the match .
It is nice to play tennis outside on the court when the weather is hot .
But you ca n't play if there is too much wind , because the ball becomes uncontrollable !
Windsurfing because I have done it for a long time .
I like windsurfing because it is a sport of speed and slide like skiing and surfing .
You need techniques to control the surfboard .
You must know how to use the wind and you have great sensations !
I would like to ask you questions : must I take my clothes with me ?
Do I need some money to pay for the meals !
You have recently had a class discussion about shopping .
Now your English teacher has asked you to write a composition giving your opinions on the statement : " shopping is not always enjoyable "
In fact , shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy things but you do n't have enough money !
You can hesitate before choosing an item .
Which is the best thing to get ?
The shop assistant can be not very nice and watch you all the time .
You do n't find the item in your size or the right colour .
The item can be too expensive .
It looks fragile and it could break easily .
You must try several shops and compare the price and the quality of the items .
So you must walk all day or go by car .
And the weather must be fine if you walk in town .
Shopping is not always enjoyable if there are a lot of people in the shops because you ca n't move or find the article and stay cool !
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country .
The best time to travel for me is July because I am working and only then can I have holidays . I would be pleased if it is possible .
About accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I would like to try it .
It will be very interesting for me because normally I do not have a lot of time to do activities .
I would prefer swimming because I really like it and I am trying to swim whenever I have got some time , and painting because I have finished a painting course and I have some practice with this .
That is very nice that all costs are paid for but I would like to ask you how much money I should take with me because I do not know anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me , so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activity .
Thank you for the letter and I am looking forward to an answer .
Thank you for answering my last letter , I hope your sister 's health is better than last time and she is all right .
My life is a little bit changed after that concert last month .
I will try to explain to you why .
As you know I was helping to make all the decorations before and during the concert .
It was a really wonderful new experience for me .
I have never before met so many people and I did n't now that is so hard to keep everything in order during a concert .
Now I know that everything needs patience , time and hard work before someone sings any record on stage .
The people were wonderful , they were helping each other with everything and it was a lot easier to do .
It is a very nice feeling when you need help and there are so many people who want to help you .
I am writing to you , because I would like to disagree with your advertisement for the show ' over the Rainbow ' .
I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening at your theatre .
At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage , but there was a totally different actor .
As it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes , because according to the programme it started at 20.15 , but that is not the end of the story ; in your advertisement it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets . That was not true !
I was still not very disappointed , because I hoped that I would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant , which I could have according to your advertisement , but what I did not realise , it was closed , because the chef was in hospital .
I did not have a perfect evening at all and I would like to ask you to return my money .
Every day we keep in touch via technology .
We have microwaves that help us to make our meals quickly , we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes , we have different things that make our lives easier .
I use different technological things every day .
Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world , even if I am not at home ; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music ; I use tapes , CDs , hairdryers , etc .
I think that all these things have made my life much easier .
Many years ago people did n't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot .
I am very happy that with all the technology that we have we do n't have to work as much as they did , doing things like washing plates and cups after meals . My dishwasher will do that for me , and I do n't have to wash my clothes , my washing machine does it better .
Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over from humans and of course it makes me lazy .
However , now I have more freedom , free time , and privacy .
This is just a note to confirm for you that I have received your letter .
I am so happy to have won the first prize in your competition . I will be happy to be for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I understand from your letter that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me , including transport to and from the airport .
To answer your questions , I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July , because I will be studying for the Cambridge exam till 1 July .
Would it be possible to have accommodation at Camp California in a tent , because I haven't had a chance to sleep in one .
And would it be possible to do swimming and surfing .
I am very good at swimming .
I have been doing it for as long as I can remember .
At surfing I am not good at all .
I have been dreaming about this activity since I was 10 years old .
I would like to know how many people will stay with me in the tent , and do I have to take with me any special clothes for surfing .
I will contact you , if I have more questions .
I look forward to being at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Yours sincerely
I like shopping . I love to go shopping .
But only if I have money ! ! Or some money . Shopping ca n't be enjoyable if you do n't have money to spend .
I think going shopping in a big space like Harrodss is not a pleasure .
Because it 's crowded with people .
I like to be in small boutiques , and I would rather go shopping along and during the weekend .
Because I do n't like to give some advice it 's can be really boring .
And going shopping after the weekend is not for me .
I do n't know what more I can tell you .
Drop me a line or give me a call if my writing is not so good for you .
And I 'll miss your lessons .
I am sending you this reply with the information that you need .
I would like to travel in July because I am a student so I only have holidays in this part of the year .
About the accommodation , I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to staying in them when I travel .
The activities that I want to do at the camp are Basketball and Surfing .
Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall and I used to play it very well .
On the other hand I know almost nothing about surfing but I would like to learn and to do the sport because I think it is cool .
It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend on food and that kind of thing .
Yours sincerely
There are people that love going shopping .
They are addicted to buying things .
Some doctors say that shopping without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsive shopper .
He ca n't stop buying things . He spends all his money buying things that he sometimes does n't use .
I think this is one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem .
Sometimes , shopping can be really boring , especially on important dates when the shops are absolutely crowded and you ca n't see anything you wanted with careful .
13th June , 2000
I received your letter this morning . Thank you very much for your kind letter and for choosing me .
I can only travel in July because I have already booked and fully paid for a holiday in the Middle East , from 25th July till the end of August .
If you can arrange my departure time for 1st of July it would be convenient for me .
I would like to stay in a tent , because I had many great times in tents during my previous holidays , if it can be arranged .
I want to do these two activities while I am at the camp : sailing and photography .
I have great experience of sailing . I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey .
And I have a certificate in using a radio ( VHF ) .
I have knowledge of navigation , engine , ropes and knots , and sails as well .
My other passion is photography , I especially like black and white photography . I have a camera , it is a Minolta X300 .
It is a manual camera . I know how to develop films and print photographs .
I am not sure about clothes , money and the immigration rules of the USA .
Please could you tell me what the weather is like there , what kind of clothes I need and how much money I should bring .
Yours sincerely .
I like shopping but I had a bad experience on a recent shopping trip .
I went out to get some shopping and to get some ideas about new computers and products .
First of all , I went to a local shop but they did n't have a big enough selection of products .
It was very crowded , I could hardly move in the shop .
I decided to buy a CD - ROM drive for my old computer .
When I approached the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone .
My money , travel card and credit card had gone .
It was a nightmare , there were pickpockets in the shop .
I went to the shop 's customer services but it was useless .
As soon as possible , I phoned my bank to cancel my credit card but they had already used it .
It cost me about Â£ 500 .
This experience has changed my shopping habits , now I do all my shopping on the Internet .
But I 'm not sure whether it is safe .
But you must always be on your guard against pickpockets .
Dear Helen ,
I have received your letter , which makes me happy .
For the first time in my life I have won a competition . I would like to take you up on your invitation in July .
I am only able to take my holiday in July . The rest of the year I work .
I would prefer to stay in a tent .
I do n't know why but I have feel toward to tent from my childhood .
When I was a kid I used to ask my mum to buy me a tent for my bedroom so I would be able to sleep in there instead of my bed .
I 'm crazy about tennis and swimming .
I used to take tennis and swimming lessons when I was in high school .
I have good talent and skill about them .
Most of the weekend I go swimming and play tennis .
That is the fun for me to doing it .
Do I have to bring some cash with me ?
Do you think traveller 's cheques would be more safe ?
I would also like to get some information about the weather .
What is it like in July over there ?
Yours sincerely ,
Can you imagine Friday night ?
Most people get paid on Friday night then they go shopping .
I ca n't stand in long queues .
You have worked hard all day . On the way home you want to pick up some milk from the shop and you have to wait ten minutes on average .
Your time has been stolen .
I prefer to go home without any milk .
There are a lot of tills in the shop but most of them are closed .
It is annoying .
There are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult .
It is hard to decide which is best for you .
After shopping you have to carry a heavy bag a long way home
I did n't have a good time !
There was another actor , James Kee , but I did n't like him ! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he was n't there .
In addition to that , the show did n't start at 20.15 ; so it ended at 23.45 and I could n't go to a meeting .
I 'm very disappointed by all these problems !
The ticket 's price was Â£ 20 and there were n't any discounts !
I did n't have great fun , so I ask for that money back .
Yours faithfully
In fact , some days before Karin , a friend of hers , had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John , her science teacher .
Pat was astonished , and did n't know what ( she ) should tell Karla .
This age difference was too big !
So she decided to tell Hill the whole story .
Hill liked Pat very much , but only as a friend .
He was 19 ( years old ) , so Pat thought that he would know what was the best thing to do .
But the situation was n't simple , so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary , the teacher 's cousin .
So they went to talk with her about the situation , but when she knew that they knew her feelings for Mr. Beek , she decided not to tell Pat anything ever .
I am writing to you to complain about the dreadful evening I had when I went to see your show at the Circle Theatre on the 9th June .
To start with , the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did n't perform as advertised .
They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed in a musical .
If I had only one reason to ask you for my money back ; it would be this .
But to add to this I had to join a long queue to get a full - price ticket when I had brought my student card for the purpose of getting the discount which had been advertised but did n't in fact exist .
The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore I and my friends were n't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed for sanitary reasons .
For this disappointment and your inaccurate advertisement and for all the given reasons , I ask you for a refund of five pounds per ticket .
This trait did n't allow you to tell him much about yourself .
He was n't really wicked , he merely did n't understand when to keep his mouth shut , especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so - called " private life " runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and did n't even know .
But a small drama can grow out of proportion as children are very sensitive .
I believe this is a rule of society , it 's a sort of group behaviour , and belongs to childhood and the teenage years .
In my opinion what is more regrettable is when we grown - ups continue this bad habit .
The critical spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets .
What allows us to reveal parts of someone else 's private life ? Nothing .
Thank you very much for awarding me the first prize - Camping in California .
I would like to have my two weeks with you in July , as it will be during my summer holiday . In addition to that , it is said to be the best season there .
I will join in with the swimming group and the photography group .
Both of them are my hobbies . I have won some prizes in my school competitions in them .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because I have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothing and also how much pocket money I need .
The concert I helped at last week was the greatest experience I 've ever had .
You know , although I 'm a pop music fan , I 'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening .
I left the hi - fi system on the left side ( it should have been on the other side ) .
Before his opening , the pop star noticed the mistake . Otherwise it would have been a disaster .
The performer , Paul , is a big name at the present .
But I 'd never seen him before .
I told him I loved his songs . He was very happy .
Then , we had a lovely conversation .
Afterwards , he gave me his pen for my enthusiasm .
Write soon . Tell me how you 're getting on in your new job .
Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , thinking that I would have a perfect evening , as its advertisement promises us .
At first I became worried because there were n't any discounts available , though your advertisement says there are .
And I became even more angry when I had to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin .
It 's necessary to start on time , and your paper had informed us that it would begin at 19:30 .
To complete my sadness , the main actor was replaced by another one who I 'd never heard anything about , and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement has .
It is n't fair not returning the money to a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great , but actually was a disgrace .
And because of that , everyone at school got to know that Ali was dating Nick , who was Caroline 's boyfriend at the time .
Pat was Ali 's best friend , and because of that , Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline 's boyfriend , but asked her to keep it secret .
Caroline discovered everything , and argued with the unfaithful couple .
It was a big quarrel , people that were many metres away could hear it .
Pat entered the fight , and it became more loud and aggressive .
One more week passed , and things became calm : Ali decided never to look Pat in the eye anymore .
They have become big enemies .
So , it 's very important to be a person who can keep secrets , even your own secrets , or a friend 's one .
One of the most beautiful things in the world is true and loyal friendship .
Then , we have to be the best secret keepers possible , or we will end up like Ali and Pat .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which I saw last Saturday .
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely disappointed by the show .
I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to have a drink before I went to the hall so I got there earlier .
It was about fourty five minutes later than the original starting time .
I was just a bit upset but I was n't that upset at that time .
The actor should have been Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before .
I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you did n't even mention that that actor was going to be changed to another man .
This thing should n't have happened .
After I finished watching the show I went to the restaurant which you advertised .
It was about 21:00 , I thought it was a bit later but it was n't my fault anyway .
I 'm too upset to say anything anymore and I want to get my money back which I paid for the show .
I look forward to hearing from you before I do my futher reaction .
Yours faithfully
Nowadays , we have millions of styles of fashion and every single person has their own fashion .
Fashion has become a part of our life and some people think that what clothes you wear is the most important thing .
We spend lots of time choosing clothes or shoes .
100 years ago , people dressed differently .
Women wore dresses and men wore suits in England .
I think people will wear metal clothes like in Robotcap .
The environment will be very polluted and finally we 'll get diseases . We will need helmets to cover our heads and we will also need air - supplyer .
Maybe , science will be developed and make our environment clean , and we will not wear anything at all ! ! ! ( except underwear ) .
I hope that the environment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be .
We should try hard to create new fashion and suitable fashion in future times .
I went to the international arts festival which you organized .
You had better invite more nationalities .
And some concert halls were too small , so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films next year than this year .
Because it is not complex , also we do n't confuse .
If you can improve these points , your festival will be better than this year 's .
Yours sincerely
We are allowed to do a lot of things .
For example , we can wear any clothes and shoes - whatever we want .
And it does n't matter if we enter the classroom at any time we want .
Of course we can go out of the classroom at any time .
But some schools in my country do n't allow a lot of things .
One of the rules at my friend 's school is you are not allowed to drink or eat anything during a class .
And the students have to wear uniforms , so they ca n't choose their clothes .
It is that I have to come back to my house by 11 o'clock at night .
The advertisement promised there would be my favourite star , Danny Brook , but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook . In addition , the performance started 45 minutes late , so we could n't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already .
Moreover , when I was buying our tickets , there were n't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and I are both on a pension .
As a result , our evening was completely spoiled .
So I am sure you will understand why I am so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incident .
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future to offer me a partial refund .
Two days before , her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to divorce . Maria was so upset that she could n't keep it to herself .
Her father had met another woman who was not as pretty as Maria 's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary .
All her father 's things were missing .
They could not believe their eyes .
They read the letter and slowly went into the kitchen .
Maria had bought his favourite food and she threw it into the bin .
How could he have done it to them ?
She went to school , but she could not follow the lessons as easily as she used to .
Now everyone knows about her sad story and that makes her feel even worse .
I am writing to complain about your music show entitled " Over the Rainbow " , which I saw during my holiday in London .
Firstly , I expected to see a performance by Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor .
Secondly , according to the advertisement , the show should have started at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
Moreover , the theatre restaurant was closed for maintenance .
You should have let us have that information in advance .
Finally , although I heard a student discount ticket was available , the ticket salesman said I should have bought one at least one day before the show .
Therefore , I think you should pay me some money back .
Please let me know what you think of my complaint and request as soon as possible .
I think modern technology has changed my daily life , especially when it comes to communication with my best friend , who is studying in Britain .
We saw each other once a week before she left Japan for Britain .
I feel no distance as if I was speaking with a friend in Japan .
Without a computer and a telephone , I could n't contact her easily and I might lose touch with her .
In addition , I can go to Britain by plane to see her .
Before the plane was invented , I suppose it might have taken several months to visit Britain by ship .
At present , it takes just 12 hours by plane .
Thanks to such modern technology , I can improve my relationship with my friend , even if she is living far away from me .
I am writing to you to thank you for the prize you 're giving me .
This is the first time in my life that I won anything like that .
When I received your letter , I could not believe it .
I am glad to reply to your letter .
Unfortunately , I will only be able to go in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for that month .
On my last holiday in a tent I had a very bad experience , the mosquitoes nearly killed me .
I would prefer a log cabin .
I am a lover of danger sports .
I am a really good singer .
I enjoy karaoke a lot .
I am in doubt as to what kind of clothes I have to bring with me .
And may I also ask you how much money I have to take with me .
Please , if you could help me with this I would be very glad .
Yours sincerely
I had the best experience in my life .
I 've to relax to this to you very well .
The company I work for works for Los Svaves . It 's a very famous group from my country .
Can you guess who they chose for the job , " me " , yes , me , I could n't believe it .
At the moment just I went just to one concert .
My job basically was to , before and after the actuation , make everything ready .
I got used to doing it very quickly .
To be honest the most exciting part of all this was getting to know the group .
The singer is a very nice guy , as are the rest of the group .
If this happens again I 'll write to you to tell you more .
I am writing to you to give you the suitable information you need about me .
But also I would like to thank you for the very nice prize .
Here is some of the information : I would like to travel in July because the school year ends then and I will be able to go on vacation .
I would be very pleased if I could practise basketball and swimming . I am very good at basketball and I play in my school team .
Of course there are some things that I would like to ask you . If possible , I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take with me .
And finally how much money I will need to have with me .
Thank you again
Yours Sincerely ,
You know that last month I helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it very much .
First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the concert would take place .
It was amazing !
I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators . I even met some very interesting people with whom I became really good friends .
What I liked the most was working with the singers , teaching them how to dance and follow some steps .
This was an experience I 'll never forget .
First of all , we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three - day trip to London .
Indeed , we are especially interested in the sightseeing tour by bus .
How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city , so famous for that !
Besides , as there are more girls than boys in the class , they would certainly enjoy attending on live make - up and hairstyles .
So , instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon , we could go to the show .
We could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon , as we should have some free time .
Yours Sincerely ,
On the one hand , I think that some famous people are looking for media attention .
The more they are in the media , the more famous they will be .
In my opinion , some of them need to be appreciated by fans , they need to be loved and see themselves on television .
Besides , I think that some stars sometimes call journalists to tell them where they will be , in order to have free publicity .
Moreover , in my opinion , it is also a good way for them to earn money .
Famous people are so often asked to give interviews , either in the newspapers or on television , that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it .
In my opinion , it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they are under to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photographer .
They can not go to public places , unless they disguise themselves and they are ready to sign autographs .
They would really like a normal life , either because of their temper or out of regard for their children .
Nevertheless , they are never left alone , which is a shame .
We have to respect them as human beings , which we often forget they are .
Dear Mrs Clark
I am writing to you to " help " you with your festival next year . Last year was n't very good so maybe we can make it more attractive this year .
First , I think we should rent bigger halls so that we can make a better sound and give more space for the audience !
If we will offer one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events we can make more people interested .
We can invite stars and artists from around the world who will play and presentspresent all kinds of music like jazz , rock , classical etc .
It should be done so people can see how people in every corner of the world have fun .
Art exhibitions are a good idea too , to explain how the music is made and show how the instruments work .
Afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so they could get to know them personally .
If you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone
Yours sincerely
Dear Simona ,
Thank you for your letter . It was so nice to hear from you again and I am glad you have mentioned this subject .
It 's believed that English schools look different and have different rules to Polish schools but maybe we might find something in common .
First of all , it depends what kind of school it is :
Primary , high school or university . I think that now Polish schools are making progress but they still have lots of bad habits .
Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have fewer practical lessons , and sometimes it 's hard to get books or other things needed for studying .
The relations hip between students and their teachers or principals is very poor !
During lessons we are not allowed to have food or drink , and we ca n't be late to school
School is supposed to be our second home but it 's not . We work hard and at the end of our education we still have nothing .
You ask me what would I change ?
I would make schools less stressful , with added fun 'cause that way it 's easier to learn and I would give students more chances to share their fantasies at school .
Maybe the Polish system is not bad , but it 's comfortable too .
I know that this letter will not change anything but you can see how complicated a Polish student 's life is
Yours
Dear Helen
I was very pleased when I knew that I had won the first prize .
For accommodation I would prefer log cabins because they are more comfortable than tents .
For two activities , regarding the first one , can I do Tennis , please .
Because I 'm very good at tennis .
Regarding the second one , can I do Photography , please .
Because this is my hobby .
So this will be my first chance to use it .
Can you tell me what sort of clothes I need to bring , please .
I 'm not sure about the weather in California in the daytime and in the nighttime .
And do you have any idea how much money I need to bring ?
Thank you very much for your offer .
I hope to hear from you .
Thanks for the letter asking about the pop concert .
My responsibilities were selling the tickets and making sure that everything was alright .
It was good to work with a lot of people and to share experiences .
I would feel sad if I had n't gone there .
They gave me a concert T - shirt .
I 'll show you my photographs .
From that time I had a lot of friends also some of them were old friends from college .
So we still keep in touch .
And the next concert we were promised we 'll be there again .
I wish you had been there with us .
Because sometimes you would n't have known the experience until you had had it .
Anyway , I will send you some photographs .
Please give my love to your family .
I am writing this letter to remind you of some faults of your theatre .
From my point of view , your organisation has to be careful to organise an activity .
I attended your activity .
I 'm sorry but I did n't have a good remark of your activity when I left .
That 's why I wanted to write to you .
The first time , when I saw the advertisement in the newspaper , I really appreciated .
Coming an hour earlier is the proof of my feeling .
Because I believe that if you want to get satisfaction you have to sacrifice a little bit .
But that was n't all .
On the other hand , I could n't see the same actors whose names were written on the advertisement . I was really shocked .
Because from my point of view the buildings of a play are the actors .
It was unpleasant for me to see different actors on the stage .
In addition , you did n't keep your promise which
That 's why she came across with so many problems .
Beatrice thought so .
When she came to school , at first , we wanted to warn her .
On the other hand Beatrice and her family were our next - door neighbours .
Her father never let her have a boyfriend .
Yes , it was strange behaviour .
One day Beatrice came to me with some tears on her face .
I could n't believe it .
Because I had got used to seeing her always cheerful and laughing .
But this time the situation was inversed .
She asked if we could speak a little bit .
She had told Pat that her father would n't let them be friends anymore .
After that , Pat had told everyone that Beatrice 's father
I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment with your theatre .
In the advertisement that I received , it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept waiting for it to start for half an hour .
And there were no discounts available either , unlike what was written in the same advertisement .
Another disappointing point was that I wanted to see Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show , but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him .
Because of all these reasons , which I have listed above , my evening , which should have been perfect , turned into a disaster .
Yours faithfully ,
And now the situation was becoming harder to put up with .
On the one hand it was her best friend who wanted her to keep this secret .
But on the other hand it was her best friend 's family that she must lie to .
Her best friend was going out with a boy that night , and she had told her parents that she was going to stay at Pat 's house , in order to get permission .
She did not trust the boy , and it was very hard for her to lie to people that she liked so much .
And she realized that if something happened to her best friend , it would be her fault and her best friend 's parents would blame her for it .
Of course , her best friend would never trust her again and never share any secrets , but she was doing this for her best friend 's sake , was n't she ?
I am writing to you about my complaints about the musical show at your theatre that I watched a week ago , during my stay in London .
That evening , the problems started with the tickets ... Unlike what was stated in the advertisement that was published in the Guardian , there were no discounts available , although I had an International Student 's Identity Card .
Secondly , the show started after a delay of 45 minutes , and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed .
Another problem was the male actor who starred : the well - known and talented actor mentioned in the advertisement was replaced by another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theatre restaurant , which was supposed to be open and available for meals after the show , but it was closed .
I think you owe me an apology and a full refund .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Do we ever see a naked person in the streets ?
Except in some very extraordinary cases , no .
Tell me , why do people care so much about what they wear and what others wear ?
Because clothes play a crucial part in our everyday lives .
Maybe because of this , just like living things , clothes evolve .
What about the clothes of people in a hundred years ' time ?
In my opinion the clothes of the world , in a century time 's , will be styled in a Japanese way : minimalist and naturalist .
Throughout history , we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural , such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be " out " .
Of course , technology will change too .
Maybe new kinds of fabrics that are capable of insulating light or heat will be used .
Actually , some clothes like that are being developed today , but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future .
Finally , it seems to me that the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalistic and minimalist and also , the fabrics that are used will change too .
In fact , we can not know what time will give and take away , so let 's wait and see the clothes of the future .
I appreciated this big news .
This is because my college will finish at the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Second , I prefer to stay in a log cabin .
I usually stay in a tent during camping .
Actually , I do n't like tents so much .
Therefore , I am interested in staying in a log cabin .
I learned painting when I was a school student .
In particular , I like water painting .
Also , I belonged to a golf club when I went to university in Japan .
Finally , I would like you to advise me about clothes and pocket money , which I will take . Thanking you for your time .
In particular , I prefer to go to department stores . They are heaven ! I can spend all day in there .
In fact , they have many kinds of products which make me happy .
To be honest , I do n't always buy these products , but I can be satisfied with just looking at them .
Some people do n't like to go shopping with a friend who takes a long time to decide .
I believe there are a lot of ways to enjoy shopping .
I think many people , especially women , have the same experience .
But the most important thing to enjoy shopping is not to spend all the money which you have .
It really took me by surprise , this prize . I did n't think I would be so lucky as to win .
First of all , about your enquiries , the only time suitable for me to travel is in July .
The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefore I need to be here .
Secondly , I would rather stay in a tent . There 's no further reason than that it would be a new experience for me and I 'm very excited about it .
I am very keen on photography so I definitely will choose this as one of my activities at the camp .
I have got some experience already and I 'm used to any weather conditions , furthermore I simply love water sports and their challenges .
Finally I 'd like to ask you some questions , which are mainly about small details .
I am not sure whether I will need some special clothes . If not what sort of clothes should I bring , and also how much money roughly will I need for my daily expenses . I would be very grateful for your help and advice in these matters .
My dear friend , I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am . You must remember me telling you about the pop concert . Well now that it 's over I have time to tell you everything about it .
The concert was a huge success . Lots of people came and enjoyed the music .
Especially when the musicians arrived . They can be very demanding people and sometimes they come up with very odd requests .
For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label which was impossible to get .
My tasks were very specific .
I had to help with the layout of the stage , which was very complicated , because there are so many cables , and weir and things going on at the same time .
After that part was fully functioning I moved on to work backstage .
I really enjoyed working with those people . They are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes .
However , what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing , jumping and enjoying frenetically something that I had been part of and helped to make happen .
I was spending some days in London and liked the idea of seeing this show a lot .
My disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets , but as we wanted to see Danny Brook 's performance , we decided to buy them anyway .
We got really upset when we realized he had been substituted .
Besides the boredom of having to wait for forty - five minutes , we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show , since it was already closed by the time the show finished .
As it was not our perfect evening out , as you promised in your advertisement , we would like to know if it would be possible for us to get a refund .
Its name is " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " , and I really was impressed with the coherence of the stories .
Agatha Christie presents situations that make us break up our minds .
The crimes she describes seem so perfect that we think a lot trying to find out who is the criminal .
I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place on a Detective course .
Agatha Christie 's stories are simple , but very well written , and , as I told you , very coherent .
It 's stimulating to read them .
I 'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately , and find out there are many challenges in your new career .
I would like to congratulate you on the excellent programme that you have prepared .
I think that it is such a good programme , especially because the places that we visit , like the Science Museum , are very interesting .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London and where the latest fashions will be shown .
There we will have the chance to be made up or to try new hairstyles , too .
And it has free entrance for students .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place during our visit to London , on the 14th of March .
We think that , if you do n't have any problem , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure show .
We are waiting for your decision and we will accept it whatever it may be .
In my opinion , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today .
I think that it will have a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights in the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa .
Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like a UFO , in my opinion the changes wo n't be very great , they will probably consist of making the housework easier .
The clearest example is to compare a house from the beginning of the 20th century with our houses . Both are very similar but now we have new technologies .
On balance then , I think that the houses that we see in films wo n't really exist .
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have received your letters and I am going on the trip .
I would like to go on the trip in July because my school , which is Berkeley International School , is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students .
The other reason is , I think in July the weather is not so cold .
The weather conditions will be suitable for camping .
I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabin because sleeping in a tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to nature .
Every night I would like to go out of the small tent into the nice environment outside the tent .
Also , staying in a tent is more comfortable .
I 'll have to be careful about insects so I 've bought so many insect repellants .
I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and go swimming .
When I was in the fourth form , I got the first prize in a swimming competition and third prize in tennis .
I was a bit disappointed with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or second prize .
Lastly , I would like to ask you some questions .
And do I have to bring some money ?
It would be very kind of you if you could answer my questions .
Yours sincerely ,
How are you ?
I have an interesting story to tell you . I 've been asked to help by the well - known band Westlife .
At first I was surprised but a few seconds later , when I realised that I was n't allowed to go , I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go .
Eventually , she allowed me to go .
I had to help them behind the stage , while they were getting dressed .
I had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly .
Although the work was not hard , I gained a lot of experience .
They gave me their autographs and when the concert started , they told me to come up on the stage and dance with them .
I was really embarrassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that was the very best experience I have ever had .
I really enjoyed the concert .
The thing that I particularly liked about the concert was I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert , which is another well - known band .
Tell me yours . I want to know what experiences you had when you were in England .
I am writing to you in connection with your programme for spending three days in London .
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March between 10.00 - 19.00 .
I would be grateful if you could include this show in your programme .
It is very thoughtful of you to take all of us to London .
This is a great opportunity for me to explore and experience London myself , especially The London fashion and leisure shows .
Most of the shows are about fashionable things for students my age .
I think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of show , for instance latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , how to put on make - up and how to have appropriate hairstyles .
In my opinion , I think you should have this event in the afternoon instead of going shopping and move the shopping slot to the afternoon on Wednesday .
I hope this information will help you to understand and include it in your programme .
I trust you to pay immediate attention to my suggestions .
Yours sincerely ,
I closed my eyes , took a deep breath and jumped out of the tower .
There were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this test .
I was very afraid of the height and was very nervous .
I was given the list of activities while I was taking part in the adventure school schemes at the soldier camps in the north of Thailand .
There were many tasks that I had to complete ; for instance , climb the mountain , learn how to use various kinds of gun , and how to survive if I got lost in a forest .
The last task I had to do was jump out of the high tower .
The assistants were the real soldiers and they were very kind and helpful , even though they looked very strict and unkind .
It was the hardest time for me because I lived in the city most of my life and I had never known how to survive in a forest and how difficult to work as soldiers .
I eventually managed to complete all the tasks that I had been given and I was very proud of this .
I think I would like to travel only in July because I 'll have just finished my course at that time , and I can have a short holiday in these days .
Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins . I think I like both of them , because I 've never been there before , and never heard of these two places .
I am very interested in both places but , I can just choose one place . I think I will choose log cabins ; they sound good and if I have time , maybe I can stay in tents next time ( maybe next year ) .
When I am at Camp , I will choose singing and photography . I can sing classical music and pop music , seem like rock & roll .
My mum likes me singing this song .
And I can also take very good photographs , because I learned to do this in China two years ago .
Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about the stay . What 's the weather like ?
What kind of clothes shall I take ? And how much does it cost per night to stay in a Hotel ?
A lot of people enjoy shopping very much . Me too .
Firstly , I am a student . I do n't have a job , so , I have to ask for money from my parents .
I ca n't ask for too much . That 's very bad for my parents .
When I go shopping ,
I always feel ashamed because I spend my parents ' money .
( Although I have got a part - time job , it provides just enough to pay my rent . )
Secondly , if you live in a big city , things are always expensive .
You spend more money on buying clothes and food , you think you will be very happy when you shop , but when you come back home and take out your purse , you will be sad . Your purse is nearly empty ( when you do n't have enough money ) .
Sometimes , when you shop on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy them once , then maybe you will feel very sad .
And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things what you like so funny , is n't it ?
Another thing is when you shop on a busy street , like Oxford St in London , a lot of thieves are there . They will steal your money . That 's so dangerous .
This will stop when I get a good job .
I am writing this letter to you to point out the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and what happened in real life .
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you wrote in your advertisement .
I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose to see Over The Rainbow , but I did n't even see him on the stage .
Moreover it was written in the advertisement that the musical was between 14.30 and 18.30 .
Surprisingly the show started at 20:15 .
Then I decided to have dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show , but unfortunately it was closed .
I think all of these disappointments are too much for one evening .
All in all I am sure that you have understood it was n't my perfect evening out and you will give me my money back .
I am looking forward to hearing your good news
Yours faithfully ,
That was also my fault . I do n't know why I told Pat this .
Yesterday Larry suggested going to the cinema after school .
Going to the cinema with the boy I love .
Of course I accepted immediately .
I was walking in the clouds for the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me .
I suddenly remembered that I had promised Pat that I would help her with her history homework .
She came up to me and said " Ready for this evening ?
Do n't forget to bring your history books . "
I told her that I wanted to tell her something .
Then I explained what had happened that morning .
She was going to cry .
" I see . You are choosing Larry , but I thought that I was your best friend . "
I told her not to tell anyone this .
After school Larry and I went to the cinema , but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us .
When they asked me the reason I told them that I promised my Mom to stay in with her .
When I closed my bedroom door I burst into tears .
Everyone at the school knew about my love for Larry including him .
Pat was the only person who had known about it .
I 'm very surprised to win this prize .
About the information , I would like to travel in July because it 's only the month when I have a vacation .
About the accommodation at Camp California , I would prefer tents because I like the countryside and I like to listen to the birds .
At the camp I would like to play tennis and golf .
My level in these two activities is medium . I never practise them both .
I would like to ask you some questions .
How much money should we take ? Or is n't it necessary ?
What kind of clothes met it ?
In the first prize you include a second person like my husband ?
Is it necessary to wear special clothes for the activities ?
Thank you again for this first prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I 'm very happy .
When we arrived at the shopping centre , I saw a lot of people .
I do n't understand why there were a lot of people .
My friends and I went to a clothes shop - " Mango " - to buy some clothes .
Nobody in the shop came with us to help .
There were four guys , in this shop .
We asked them if one of them could help us .
Finally , a very friendly girl came with us .
My friends bought some things like red trousers and white tee - shirts .
But it 's not always the same story because I like shopping and I think I 'm enjoyable .
The people in the shops are not unfriendly all the time .
I , as a head member of the students who participate in this year 's trip to London , would like to thank you for the excellence of the programme you have planned for us .
In particular , I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries in the world .
London being one of the most multicultural , multiracial cities , we can not avoid the fact that in these days The London Fashion And Leisure Show takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall ( Tuesday March 14th ) 10:00 - 19:00 . ) .
Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes to the fabulous Programme you have offered .
These changes will not affect the contents of the programme itself .
I also would like to remark that this change does not increase the cost of the trip , because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students .
I want to thank you , Sir , for your time .
" Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger was knocking at your door every day .
It was 20 years ago and we had been friends since we were 10 .
In those days we decided to be friends forever and work for NASA .
Of course we had n't got enough points in the test to do it .
So , we decide to access our school 's Main database and change our test results .
This way we could obtain rare places at NASA university .
The task was not easy , at 18 you do n't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it . There was nothing to lose .
Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure systems and new encryption algorithms .
I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days of our stay in London and would like to thank you .
We have been told there are a lot of interesting paintings and ancient sculptures , there which we are all keen to see .
A couple of days ago , my classmates made the suggestion that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London , at the Central Exhibition Hall , which was advertised in a school magazine , and there is free entry for students .
The show includes the latest fashions , sportswear for spare time , make - up and hairstyles .
We agreed in the class that we would like to visit this show on Tuesday 14 March in the afternoon after lunch instead of going shopping .
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hear from you soon .
In my opinion , most of these people are aware of the consequences of fame , like not having a " private life " anymore .
As soon as they are famous , they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place .
I can imagine how annoying it can be sometimes .
Just imagine that you 'd like to go shopping , clubbing or to a restaurant with friends .
There 's really no way to be together simply with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by the paparazzi .
It is the way they earn money , of course .
But on the other hand I have to mention that they go too far sometimes to get a picture .
For example , Lady Diana . Do you think she would still be alive if she and her boyfriend had n't been followed by those nosy paparazzi ?
Well , this is an open question to anyone .
I am amazed about the prize in your competition .
I am looking forward to going to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information .
About accommodation , I would prefer to stay in a tent because it will be a new experience for me .
I like to have new experiences , especially when I am on holiday .
I am pleased to have the opportunity to do sports as well .
Will Camp California provide the clothes for swimming and playing tennis ?
In my opinion shopping is a very good practice that gives you more opportunities to enjoy yourself .
I do n't understand why men do n't like shopping , at least they say that they do n't .
Despite the fact that I love shopping I have to agree that it is not " always " enjoyable .
It 's annoying .
You should n't go shopping when the shops are so busy because it 's so annoying .
Another point is that now you do n't need to go out shopping .
You can buy a lot of products over the Internet .
In conclusion I think there are boring times and enjoyable times when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring times .
During my stay in your city , I had the opportunity to attend your show named ' Over the rainbow ' after having read an advertisement in the magazine ' Going - out ' , the 1st of June issue .
The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre : my 6-year - old son had to pay the full price .
Then , even if we could enter the theatre , the show did n't start before 20:15 , which is 45 minutes later than expected .
Indeed , we are still waiting for Danny Brook who was not in the play .
And last , at the end of the performance , we would have liked to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant , but it was already closed due to the poor attendance .
As this evening was for my family and a wasted one , I permit myself to ask you for a refund .
You do n't have to be a genius to notice that technology has evolved so considerably during the last few decades that our everyday life has changed .
From my point of view , modern technology has permitted me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer .
In this domain , you have to afford , every day , the development of new technology .
The advantage of this is that you need to an take interest in everything if you do n't want to be left on the shelf .
And so , your life is not boring at all as you learn new things every day .
On the other hand , you can not rest for 2 weeks as some new inventions come out every day .
Finally , new technology has a great influence on my life as it permits me to live on .
But , who knows , may be one day I will develop a technology that will send me straight to the unemployment office !
I was so happy when I found out that I won first prize in your competition .
I hope that it will be a good gift for me from your organization .
You asked me when I would like to travel ?
I would like to travel only in July because in August I must go to my grandmother 's and help her to gather a harvest of fruit .
I 'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent . And with the tent I can go to another place in the camp .
When it rains it is not comfortable , but I like it .
I want to do activities like basketball .
Because I think it is a teenager 's game .
And I like painting because I like to paint nature , sea , mountains .
I often go to exhibitions of paintings of modern artists .
But I like different styles of art . I think I 'll enjoy this trip .
I want to know some information about it .
Can I stay more then two weeks if I like it ?
What day can I start my trip ? In what conditions will it be spent ? And the last one .
How much money should I take there ?
I 'm really looking forward to your answers . And I hope to see you soon .
Yours sincerely Gubin .
I abolutely agree with this .
Because I have my own experience of shopping .
For example , recently I was shopping at the market , which is located in the centre of our town .
And what do you think ?
When I was there I saw a very beautiful T - shirt .
I asked my mother to buy it .
But my mother said : " I haven't enough money to buy it " .
I was upset about it .
Our government is very bureaucratic .
Our ministers are really criminal . They often break the law , stealing money .
For example , Paul Kozin stole 800000000 dollars .
Because of it our state ca n't pay workers in schools , hospitals , on building sites . In our country there is a high number of unemployed .
Often people ca n't buy a piece of bread . And they ask for money from other people .
My parents ca n't buy me all what I want our society our full .
Each man thinks only about himself .
The quality of life is very low .
But I hope that there will be a time when each person can buy himself everything that he or she wants and shopping will always be enjoyable .
I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won , in which you requested some additional information .
I am very happy to have won a two - week trip to Camp California , but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work .
As I am an expert camper , I would prefer to be put up in a tent rather than in a log cabin .
Concerning activities at the camp , I would be highly delighted if I could play basketball and tennis .
The former because I am an excellent basketball player and the latter because I am interested in taking up a new sport and I am a complete beginner at it .
I am a little unsure about some things and I would be very grateful to you if you could answer my questions . I would like to know if I will need to take some special clothes and how much money would I need to bring with me .
After our English class 's decision to make a short film about daily life in my school , I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed .
Therefore , to show the good aspects , I suggest filming Mr. Clark 's English classes , because they are highly educational and because the students participate a lot .
On the other hand , to show less pleasing aspects , it would be sufficient to film Mrs. Morrison 's French classes , as they are extremely boring and sub - standard .
One event that should not be missed is the weekly football game between teachers and students , which shows how well they get along with each other .
Another event that should definitely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen .
In conclusion , I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video . Because the above mentioned events are the ones most praised or criticised by all students .
I have just seen the letter this morning and I am very happy about winning the competition .
I believe I have the appropriate qualifications to stay two weeks at camp California .
It would be wonderful to see you as soon as possible .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July only because I have not finished school .
I wish that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in a tent .
I had experience of this last summer .
Secondly , I am very keen on sports .
Specially sailing and swimming .
Anyway I am working hard at sailing for the world cup .
Finally , I would like to know how the weather is in July ?
Because I have to prepare all my luggage and I am sure it will be a great experience despite the cost of living .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Thank you for my birthday present .
Sorry about my last letter but I 've been travelling .
I did n't tell you about my last job . You remember last month I helped at a pop concert .
Anyway , it was fantastic . You ca n't imagine what the concert was like ?
I was responsible for checking tickets at the entrance , then I had to give a seat to everyone .
Anyway I enjoyed it so much .
I haven't been to a concert before so the atmosphere was really good .
I wo n't forget my experience in my whole life .
Do you remember the computer course that we took together . It was very useful to classify each person at the concert .
Lots of love ,
You had picked unknown but talented directors ' films and they were really worth watching .
In particular , I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore .
However , I found some things which I think I should point out .
Some concert halls were not big enough to hold the audience .
For next year , I think you should take this matter into consideration . And I think it would be much better if you had more plays and films .
To make it more enjoyable , I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments about it .
A Japanese folk story : " The Bamboo Princess "
One day , the lady went to a river to wash their clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees .
In a bamboo forest , he found a shining piece of bamboo .
She was named the bamboo princess .
The princess grew up to be beautiful .
Some princes proposed to her .
But she said to them , " If you want me , you have to do this , " and asked them to do impossible things because she did n't want to get married .
When they asked her about this , she said , " I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon " .
But , one day , the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her .
I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to enjoy the trip I have won .
To be honest , the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only at the end of June .
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been camping for years and enjoy it very much .
As I have a chance to do 2 activities while I am at the Camp , I will choose singing , which I am very good at , and swimming , which I am fond of but , unfortunately , not a professional .
Finally I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also what sum of money I will need ... during my vacation .
A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men in the world would never believe that in my opinion shopping is really not always enjoyable .
In particular , I ca n't bear to go shopping with my mother : it takes so much time that later I regret agreeing to go with her .
When I am on my own , everything is fine : I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours choosing what I really want either for myself or someone else .
Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way of doing it .
Some go just to kill time ; others to look at something new . I am in the third group - beforehand I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need .
But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day with my mother looking through a huge department - store .
I saw your advertisement about the International Arts Festival now . I think that 's a great idea
as we need some good activities . The advertisement states that you invite stars and artists from around the world .
This is incredible but you wrote down artists from only six countries .
I think you should invite people from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world .
If you invite stars and artists from more countries , your festival will be unbelievable .
The second point is there are some jazz , rock and classical concerts .
Because of this , people are bored quickly .
I congratulate you because that 's perfect .
The most important thing is dance shows
as most people like dance shows , including me .
That 's real knowledge for us , art exhibitions and talks by writers .
I think we will know a writer 's life or how he is writing about it ?
it 's a very significant thing .
Lastly , you said ' one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events ' .
If you can pay attention to my small suggestion , next year I hope it will be an unbelievable festival .
I miss you very much and sorry I haven't written you any letters .
What are you doing nowadays ? How is your school ?
However , today I am getting used to my school , I have met two sweet girls .
But this school has got a lot of rules and in our class we have been talking about rules , both at home and at school .
For instance : you must not argue with your friend or you must not argue with workers .
I feel very bad because what you are allowed I am not allowed to do at home .
Do you understand me ?
Please will you write me a letter quickly .
Love !
I am writing to you because of the musical show , " Over The Rainbow " , I saw in your theatre last week .
I looked forward to a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had .
Firstly , you did not tell the truth about the lead .
The advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook . Unfortunately there was someone else - an actor who I do not like and if I had known that he was going to be there I would not have gone to see him .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 .
Forty - five minutes later !
You also had mentioned about the discounts and there were not any .
Lastly , the restaurant which was going to be open was in fact closed without a reason being given !
Keeping in mind all these complaints , I want to ask you for some money back .
I think it could be your nice apology for all my problems and disappointments .
Yours faithfully ,
Modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives .
It affects our lives - mine too .
In fact , modern technology was already very popular and commonly used when I was born , so I can not say that it changed my life suddenly .
But I am also sure that my life would be different without it .
All these products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day .
For example , I am woken up by my electronic alarm - clock , then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water . Next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio .
All these things are the results of technology .
On the other hand , I am aware of all the disadvantages of modern technology ; pollution and the dangers it brings .
But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my century - the age of modern science .
Finally , I think that we can not talk only about the changes which modern technology has brought to our lives .
That 's because I think that we are the ones who change the technology as well .
I think that our lives are lives with technology . They sometimes mean the same as science and affects not on at each other but together .
So how has modern technology changed my daily life ?
I do n't know what it would be like without the technology .
I am writing to answer your invitation which I have received as a first prize winner .
I would be really delighted to visit Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks .
This would be an ideal opportunity for me to visit the United States to learn about the American way of life .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment , so my boss said I can have my holiday only in July .
Secondly , I 'd prefer to stay in tents . That would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California .
And I would like to choose as my activities Golf and painting .
I used to play Golf several years ago and I like to paint the composition .
Last , I have no experience of travelling abroad .
Therefore I 'd like to know about the weather in California in July .
Maybe there are some occasions when I have to pay for myself .
As mentioned above , please take care to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
Many people say : " When you have a son , send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance of the best opportunity .
There are all kinds of facilities which you can imagine .
Most of the people like to go to the centre of the City , that 's Meong - Dong where the underground arcade is and several businesses have their headquarters there .
There are also many kinds of take - away restaurants , where I can taste my favourite foods .
If I go to visit my family in Korea , I usually walk along the Meong - Dong streets , and enjoy window shopping .
But there is always a lot of traffic at all times , and the air is so polluted that I ca n't even breathe .
I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfriendly people who are too busy .
First of all , I am writing to thank you for organising the school 's trip to London .
However , the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which is going to take place on the 14th of March at the Central Exhibition Hall .
Visitors will be able to see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear and also get some help with make - up or hairstyles .
It would be a great opportunity to see this show , because we are all very interested in the subject of fashion .
What is more , admission for students is free .
In our opinion we could attend the show on Tuesday , after visiting the Science Museum .
Yours sincerely ,
These days , when we can see a picture of a famous person on the front page of almost every newspaper , it 's quite a common topic .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have a private life .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to get an interview or take an ' interesting ' picture .
I think that deep inside famous people are just ordinary people and like all of us , having a private life is important for their psychological condition .
On the other hand , we could say that they decided to have this kind of life .
However , everyone needs to keep some part of his life secret .
I am writing to you about the trip to London .
Thanks for your programme , we are all especially looking forward to Monday 13 March because we will see all the monuments in London .
However , we have got a suggestion : we saw an advertisement for " the London Fashion and Leisure Show " which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00 .
For all of us , it sounds like a great opportunity because we thought that this event would teach us about the way of life in London and English style ....
Our request is to change the programme , either you can cancel all the Tuesday and we can enjoy all the exhibition or if you can not cancel the Museum , we can go there right after because we will have plenty of time to go shopping during our free time on Wednesday .
Hoping that you will think about it carefully because we are all very excited .
Yours sincerely
Since always , medias has been keen of famous people life and it 's becoming worse and worse , you can find everything in " gossip " newspapers .
Do famous people deserve to keep their private life secret ?
In my opinion , you do n't deserve to have a private life when you 're famous because when you start your career you know that the media will be hunting you everywhere and the more famous you get the worse it is going to be because that is the lifestyle people want to know everything about , for instance , about their favourite actor or about their president . They saw them many times on T.V. or the in cinema .
And famous people like it because if you 're a star or whatever , it 's because you like to show yourself .
Therefore , even if I agree sometimes the media go too far and write really bad things ,
if you 're famous you can not have a private life because all of this is a part of your job .
And if the media are too awful they have got the law to protect themselves .
I was pleased to receive your letter recently .
Now I 'm going to give you some information you asked about .
I 'm sorry to say this , but the only time I will be able to take this trip is in July , according to our team 's schedule .
The next thing - I would prefer to spend all the nights in a tent , so I can move it to the place that will suit me best . I like to wake up with a view of mountains , which reminds me of my 5 years ' experience of climbing .
I have filled two albums with birds and flowers .
So , is it possible ? I would like to continue doing my favourite hobbies in the Camp .
Do I need to bring any special clothes or gize ?
Shopping is not always enjoyable
If you need something you have a choice of borrowing it from friends or the library , or buying it .
Let 's talk about shopping .
As with everything there are some advantages and disadvantages .
Do you think it 's an enjoyable way to spend time ?
If you were to ask me , I prefer my friends to do all my shopping for me .
Because I am aware of the big queues at the checkout , crowds of people , noise ...
And of course not all shops have good air conditioning .
In my opinion the best time for shopping is weekdays , preferably in the morning .
Otherwise , you will either not find what you are looking for , or you will , and spend the rest of the day in a bad mood , because of the bad manners of sales people , who do not give you advice every time you ask for it .
It can be boring , it can be interesting .
To summarise everything , I would recommend spending less time indoors , shopping during the weekdays .
But everything was terrible and different to your advertisement .
You wrote ' discounts available ' but they did n't offer any discount .
You advertised my perfect evening out .
But it was unpleasant because of these things .
I think there is nothing not to be influenced by science and technology affects in our daily life nowadays .
I would like to describe how modern technology has changed my daily life as a housewife .
I have a lot of housework to do from early morning until late evening .
I always use many electric appliances ; washing machine , dish - washer , vacuum cleaner , blender , juicer , fridge .
I think I can have my spare time thanks to these things .
For example if I do n't have a washing machine , I would have to wash all the clothes myself .
while the washing machine is whirring , I can have my time .
Also I ca n't imagine my life without a car .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortably .
These things provide me with every convenience .
I am writing to you because I received your letter concerning the prize of two weeks in California that I have won .
I would like to travel in the first two weeks of July because in June I will be working and at the end of July I am planning to go to Paris to attend a French course .
I would prefer to be put up in a tent because I love camping but also I do n't mind the second possibility .
In your letter you wrote that I will have the chance to do two activities ; first of all I would like to play tennis because I have been playing for seven years . Secondly I would like to attend a surfing course but I have just some elementary knowledge .
I would like also to have more information about the cost and what kind of clothes you suggest I should bring with me .
I am looking forward to your reply
Yours faithfully
First of all I would like to say that I think it is important in this video to concentrate a on few interesting parts of our daily life at school
It will be interesting to show how the lessons are organized , showing that we are never doing just one activity during the class .
We should speak about our library , that it is well furnished with many books , tapes and videos .
After that we have to make sure that we explain about the relationship between teachers and students , showing the times that we have been out together .
In addition I think that some personal opinions about the school should be reported by asking students and teachers .
Finally we should give some information also about our tourism , business and computer courses .
Thank you very much for your letter .
It is great that I could win the first prize in your competition , which means that I will have the opportunity to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am sure it will be an exciting experience for me .
As requested you will find the information you need below .
First , I would like to travel in July because my company is going to close for the holiday at that time and it would suit me very well .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in a tent because I enjoy being outside close to nature .
Thirdly , concerning the activities which I can choose , it is a little bit difficult to decide because I would like to try all of them !
I have won various little tennis tournaments in my country and abroad ,
and I am able to swim in every style .
Please let me know what clothes I need and how much money in cash and travellers cheques should I take with me .
Sometimes the bad characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones .
Recently I have read a short story written by Agatha Christie .
Its title was : " The Mystery of Hunter 's Lodge " .
The character whom I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering , the mistress .
It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time : herself and the housekeeper .
Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it ,
I think that her husband only followed her orders .
She was the boss in this story .
The plan was almost perfect and the police could n't have discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot .
In my opinion Mrs. Havering was an extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense .
Moreover she must have had an " ice blood " and strong nerves to handle things in that way .
As far as I am concerned I would appreciate having some of her characteristics myself , like take a decision and handle .
I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called " Over the Rainbow " , and I was very disappointed by it .
First of all I would like to say that it started later than it should have . I had to wait for about forty - five minutes .
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show , which was very diappointing for me because I like this actor very much , and I think that I was not the only one who was upset .
Another disappointing thing was that the discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
I think that the most disappointing thing was that the theatre 's restaurant was closed . I would add that I was hungry after the show .
I would instead say that it was a very disappointing evening , and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet in court !
Yours sincerely ,
First of all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much .
Every day when I get up I check if there are any messages left for me like e - mail or SMS on my mobile phone .
They are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive .
Modern technology has a big influence on our life .
It is easier . We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones , which are the best things ever made .
I watch about four hours of TV a day . I even eat my meals in front of the TV . We can see PEOPLE 'S LIFE in other countries , which is very interesting for me and my friends .
Also the Internet has an influence on my daily life , because I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world , which is exciting for me .
I think that life without modern technology would be simple and boring . That 's why I am using it in my daily life . I am happy that there is such a thing as modern technology .
Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to spend at Camp California
Secondly , I will be able to travel in July because I am a manager so I can not travel another time .
I would like to sing and take photographs . I 've done a course in photography and I think that I am very good at it .
On the other hand , I can not sing very well but I would like to do this activity there .
I would like to know what type of clothes I should wear there . Would you check the weather forecast for me , please ?
And how much money am I going to need to have there with me ?
A long time ago , when I started working , I received my first paycheque and went to a shopping center to spend my money on my credit card .
Finally the day to pay my credit card arrived and where was my money ?
I started to look everywhere .
I asked my mom and my friends and nobody knew where it was .
' You told me that you were going to put it in your wallet . '
I started to look for my wallet and I could n't find it , lighter .
It was an old woman asking who Maria was .
' That 's me ! ' I said .
That 's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the seat at the eating - place at the shopping center that I went to that day !
All the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for three days .
This trip would give us the chance to see London and to improve our English .
We all like the daily programme for the three days .
In the morning , we will have the chance to see some of the sights of London by bus , for example , the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery .
In the afternoon , the river trip to Greenwich will also be a fantastic experience for us .
The reason I write to you is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , for a few days .
It would be exciting if we had the opportunity to go to the show .
The show includes the latest fashions in sports clothing and the most fashionable make - up and hairstyles .
We all think that the London Fashion and Leisure Show will be a great opportunity for us .
The show is free for students and we can see the show instead of having free time on Wednesday in the afternoon .
Nowadays , with the help of the media , famous people , like politicians or filmstars , play an important role in our community .
It is also normally true that the journalists are after them .
They want to get from them all the details of their life , especially regarding their private life .
Who got married , who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion , these are questions that most journalists are interested in .
But what kind of life is it when you ca n't even go to a restaurant because you are afraid of the journalists who will be waiting outside for you ?
Famous people also deserve to have a private life .
It is a right that everybody among us has .
It is normal when you are a star that everybody wants to know all about you .
We should n't forget that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media !
I think nobody has forgotten where the curiosity of the journalists leads .
For example there was , the hunting of Princess Diana and her friend .
I hope that they will be punished for what they did !
I am writing to complain about a musical show called ' Over the Rainbow ' that took place in the Circle Theatre .
There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement .
In the advertisement it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play the main roles .
The advertisement said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
I was waiting for the show for half an hour !
The third problem was the discounts .
The advertisement said that they would be available but they were not .
It was written in the advertisement that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show , but unfortunately it was closed .
To conclude , I was not satisfied with the show I watched in your theatre and I would like a full refund .
But the most developed creature is the human .
He has lived for nearly 10 000 years .
During this time men have developed and now are the leading creatures .
They built huge cities , destroyed forests , went into space .
The modern technology , on the one hand , has made our life easier .
We use different electric kettle .
We build big cities , there is hot and cold water , electricity , gas in practically every home .
We use different transport that makes our travel faster , it speeds up our life .
We communicate with other people by telephone and mail , we read newspapers , we watch television , and get different information from the Internet .
But , on the other hand modern technology is destroying our life .
Factories have polluted the air we breath , shops have polluted the water we drink .
Many different incurable diseases have appeared .
For example , cancer occurred in Africa after American nuclear tests
All in all , technology has made our life better by destroying the environment .
In future , possibly , the technology wo n't destroy the environment , but we have to do something now , because tomorrow could be too late .
I am writing to reply to your letter in which you let me know I have won the first prize in your competition .
I would like to travel in July as it is the only month this year when I do not have any exams .
Regarding accommodation I would prefer a tent , as I love nature and I like going camping a lot .
Regarding the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball .
I have only done it once .
But , on the other hand , I am a good basketball player , and I play three or four times a week as I play in the University team .
There are some things I would like to know first of all : the kind of clothes I should take with me .
And finally , if you could tell me when I would be leaving and coming back .
Yours sincerely
I got it two weeks ago at a concert , but although I 've been to the doctor , I ca n't get over it !
But I do n't regret going to that concert .
A friend of mine was organising the pop concert , and as he knew me well , he asked me if I 'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show .
Of course , I accepted immediately , very pleased .
It was a marvellous experience . I really enjoyed working with such a nice team , they were really kind to me .
And , as if that was n't enough , I was doing what I love !
And tell me , are you planning to come back to visit me ?
Please let me know if you have some days free so we can organise a little journey together .
Well , I think I 'd better finish now .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I 'm writing with reference to your letter . I was really thrilled , when I found out that I won first prize in your competition . I always dreamed about going to California and now my dreams are coming true .
If it 's possible , I would only like to travel in July , because my school wo n't be finished earlier .
I could n't go in August , either , because I promised to go to Masurian Lakes with my friends .
If I had a choice , I would prefer to stay in a tent then in a log cabin .
I would be very grateful , if you gave me the possibility of singing .
I 've always wanted to learn to sing professionally , but I 've never had an opportunity .
Normally , I live by the seaside and I could n't live without this sport .
Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters .
I would like to ask you , what clothes should I take with me ?
My mother told me , that when she was there two years ago it was really hot .
Thanks for your last letter . I 'm sorry I haven't replied sooner , but I was very busy .
Well , it was the best time of my life ! I worked all day , but I did it with pleasure .
We lived here in rush , but there was a lot of fun , too .
I was very surprised , when I saw that singers are n't so sophisticated and self - confident as they are described in the newspapers .
One day I was talking to Stenkovska , because I had to go to buy something to eat for everyone , so I had to ask her what she wanted .
When she tried to answer me , one small child took her picture with a flash .
Imagine , she was n't angry !
If I were her , I would kill that boy , but she was nice !
Truly , my work here was n't very important , but I really enjoyed it .
I 've met so many new people here !
Sometimes somebody should on me , but I have to say they are often right .
Well , I made a couple of mistakes .
But , luckily , it was n't achieved with success of our concert . You have to admit , that the show was magnificent .
I hope you had great fun when you were watching us on the TV set , did you ?
I 'll write to you again tomorrow , because now my Mom is angry , the I am not sleeping yet .
I can hardly wait .
I 'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London .
I see that you have already organised the programme .
So I 'm writing this letter , asking if you can change the programme .
The London Fashion and Leisure show is a special event that is organized once a year . There are the latest Fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles - all things that young people want to see .
There is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anything .
I 'm suggesting how the programme could be changed .
The fashion show starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be held on 14 March , so we can change the shopping with this event , which is held in the afternoon , and do the shopping at night .
It will be a great success !
Yours sincerely ,
That was my situation at the time .
The story had begun two days before ...
" The Honorable men 's group " - Dick , Nick and I have formed this group .
Our mission was to steal women 's panties . I think that it was very stupid , but it is the most difficult thing that man can do .
It proves our bravura to be a man .
Our first challenge was stealing Dick 's girlfriend 's panties , but we failed .
And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we came to the conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult .
So we tried to steal adults ' panties .
Nick and Dick could prove their bravery stealing their mother 's panties .
I was the only one that could n't steal any panties .
So I decided to go to my grandmother 's house and try to steal some panties .
" It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it " , to prove my bravery to everyone .
I had quickly entered my grandmother 's room and started to get some panties .
I was very nervous and I forgot my shoes .
Next day my grandmother came and she gave my shoes to my mother .
I'M WRITING THIS LETTER TO SAY THAT THE RESULTS CATCH ME ABSOLUTELY BY SURPRISE !
I WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY TRAVELLING IN JULY BECAUSE I HAVE TO TAKE MY LITERATURE EXAMS BEFORE THEN AND I'M TAKING THEM IN JUNE .
TO ANSWER ANOTHER OF YOUR QUESTIONS , I'D PREFER TO HAVE A LOG CABIN , BECAUSE OF MY BACK PROBLEM , WHICH WON'T LET ME SLEEP ON THE GROUND ( OR IN A SLEEPING BAG ) .
I'M REALLY KEEN ON KEEPING TO MY TENNIS AND SWIMMING ROUTINES DURING MY STAY AT THE CAMP .
I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A BACK TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ME TO FOLLOW .
ALSO , IF I HAVE ANY LEISURE TIME BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PIANO LESSONS , I PLAY TENNIS .
SO , IF POSSIBLE , I WAS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING MY ROUTINE THERE .
LASTLY , I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAVE TO BRING SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS SO I CAN PACK MY LUGGAGE , BRINGING ONLY THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHES .
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU
ARE YOU A SCIENCE FICTION STORIES LOVER ?
DO YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF KNOWING HOW A MARTIAN IS ?
IF YOU REALLY FIND READING THIS KIND OF BOOK INTERESTING , YOU SHOULDN'T MISS THIS BOOK .
DURING THE LAST MONTH I'VE BEEN READING " A WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE " , AN OXFORD BOOKMARKS COLLECTION BOOK .
THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WERE WRITTEN BY WELL - KNOWN WRITERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY .
BUT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS TO ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW LIFE IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE , WHEN , PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE RULED BY MACHINES .
I THINK THAT THIS IS A MARVELLOUS BOOK TO READ , BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT YOUR MIND UP AGAINST THEMES LIKE " THE EXTINCTION OF THE HUMAN RACE " AND ALSO TO MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE HUMAN MIND AND COMPUTERS .
SO , IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A " REALLY SPLENDID SCIENCE FICTION BOOK " I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ " A WINDOW .. " AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU FINISH READING IT YOU WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN , AND AGAIN ... !
Dear Helen Ryan :
I am only available in July . Is that okay for you ?
This is because the only time I can take a holiday is July .
I would prefer log cabins . I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents .
Regarding the two activities , I choose swimming and painting . I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much .
I took swimming lessons for four years .
And the reason I choose painting is it 's very exciting for me . I am not very good at this subject but I will improve my painting .
I would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities .
Do you recommend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
Is it a very expensive area ?
Thank you very much for your interest
I look forward to hearing from you
It 's been a long time since I wrote to you . I 'm really sorry but I was very busy .
I worked until midnight every day .
Actually I do n't work , you know . I have been decorating a concert hall for a pop concert .
It was very enjoyable . I made lots of friends . We were together all day , painting the walls , cleaning and putting up some balloons and other stuff everywhere .
And at the time of the concert we wore big funny costumes , and danced with people .
Everybody liked it very much . Anyway we worked for that .
What I liked most was meeting the band .
Oh , my God , they 're such nice , talkative , funny , people .
I am a student in the FCE class and I am writing to you on behalf of my class to thank you for the programme for the three - day trip to London that you have prepared for us .
We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that , especially because we will have the opportunity to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Last week some students in our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March .
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear on show .
In addition we will have the opportunity to see the newest make - up and hairstyles .
For these reasons , I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday afternoon .
You can give the opportunity to the students to choose between going shopping or going to the show .
The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be open until 7 .
I hope that this change will not cause you too many problems .
In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private lives of famous people .
In this instance we can say that the journalists have , of course indirectly , caused her death .
On the other hand , famous people have to understand that people are interested in their lives .
If one is famous , one has to accept also the disadvantages of being famous .
Famous people must understand that the journalists are doing their job .
After this break he continues to ski without being annoyed for the rest of the holiday .
In conclusion I think that there must be more understanding and respect between famous people and the media .
I am really pleased to hear from you that I won first prize in the competition .
Now I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter .
First , I am afraid I can only travel in July .
I 've got a three - month holiday from June to August but I 've already promised my aunt , who runs a small nursing home in Andover , to help her during June and in August .
Second , regarding accommodation , I 'd like to stay in a log cabin .
And I would love to learn surfing and painting .
I am quite good at swimming but I never tried surfing .
I expect you have lovely countryside in California for me to draw on my canvas .
What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take ?
I am really looking forward to going there and to your reply .
For example , all shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends .
What 's worse , there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall .
So I prefer shopping on weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment .
However , people ca n't have a good time even on weekdays while shopping .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it can be very annoying unless shops have facilities for them .
Otherwise they can have lots of problems and it is difficult to live .
Thank you very much for the letter you sent me .
I am very happy to win this prize and I hope my stay there will be great !
First of all , I can only travel in July because I have exams at school and they are very important to me and I hope you will understand my problem .
And I would like to stay in a log cabin , because I do not like sleeping in tents , because of the bugs and insects .
For the activities I would like to choose the tennis , which I am not too bad at , and climbing , which I have never done but which must be interesting .
I would like to know if I need to take any clothes , and , if so , what kind of clothes ?
I also want to know if I should take any money , or if all the expenses are paid by you .
For example , when you buy something , you might lose it and never see it again , or you could be robbed , or if the product has something wrong with it , then you have to swap it and that takes time .
And sometimes the cashpoint machines do n't work , or they do n't accept your card or you have exceeded the limit on your credit card .
Another bad thing is that people want some things very badly , and they ca n't afford them .
That makes those people frustrated and they do n't enjoy themselves .
Firstly , I was asked when my trip would be and I have come to the conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during that month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go .
Regarding accommodation in tents or log cabins , I would enjoy much more being in a tent as I believe that is the right type of accommodation for going camping .
I actually have a lot of stamina and balance so that will help me in both activities .
I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will help towards the preparation for the weeks in question .
Men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favourite pastime .
However , that impression is not always true .
Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes . However , do we really like the process of choosing them ?
At times , it is not only a matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something which can waste a lot of time and especially when your taste does n't fit in with the fashion .
Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable , and many times they find , for example , a dress they like a lot but they can not buy it because it is terribly expensive .
Then , I consider it a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress .
Finally , you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts . etc .
I 'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organised last 21 and 22 of November .
I want you to know what an extraordinary time I had with my friends at the festival .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world for only that reasonably priced ticket we bought for the whole weekend .
The festival was very well organised with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
In my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small . You have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend .
In my house rules practically do n't exist because I am 18 years old now so my parents ' only wish is that I study for a university degree and be a good man .
They only want to know where I am and when I go out and at what time I came home .
At school it is completely different because the teachers do n't forgive you anything .
You have to be quiet and attentive in class if you do n't want to be punished .
I would n't like to change anything because we all need some discipline to do the right things .
When I 've time I will write to you again
I 'm writing to you to complain about last evening 's musical show .
At first my favourite actor Danny Brook did n't perform , without any explanations being given , and the show should have started at 19:30 instead of 20:15 ! !
I was sure that discounts were available because I had read that they were , but at the ticket office they did n't offer them .
So I paid for the ticket .
Jim 's mum did n't want him to take her suitcase , but he did .
So one morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and took the train for the countryside where he had to work .
But when he walked out of the station he realised that he had left the suitcase on the train .
All this story was a secret but Pat revealed it to his mother .
She was so angry and confused because Jim had n't told her the truth .
I am writing to you because I am really disappointed about " Over the Rainbow " which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized .
In your advertisement it said the show would start at 19:30 but it began at 20:15 .
Even so , I ca n't understand why the actors of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did n't appear in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook .
After all this , I wanted to make my evening pleasant but to my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because of some sanitary problems .
I explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and I want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there .
I hope to hear from you as soon as possible and thanks for understanding my situation .
Yours faithfully
Many years ago human beings or whatever we were called were another animal species but when we tried to use rocks to make a fire we changed everything .
Modern technology changed our lives in many ways : when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock , if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little toothpaste .
I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and emsamblish by machines more powerful than handwork .
Even so , this is not enough and technology created a better means of communication , first there were letters , then telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through the Internet .
It is not necessary to imagine things , you can travel all around by just making a click with your mouse and you are there .
If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take food and cook it with a microwave .
When I have a headache I swallow pills , made by technology . I think everything around us is thanks to technology but we ca n't forget that these things were made by us .
If we create guns to protect our homes , others will use them to burgle our homes , and take advantage of the defenceless people .
However , the technology never stops , we always search for new things because we are made to compete , discover , think of things which we do n't know .
Because it is the only time I will have free .
And I would prefer a tent to a log cabin .
Because I have had experience of staying in a tent and I like it very much .
Thank you for the chance to do two activities .
I have played tennis since I was ten years of age .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever played .
Another activity which I have chosen is photography .
I have just finished a professional photography course and I would like to continue my education in this activity .
First of all what kind of clothes do I have to take with me ?
Also , how much money do I have to take ?
I look forward to hearing from you .
Like I said , I helped at a pop concert .
It was very interesting and enjoyable .
The pop concert had ten pop bands .
Each of them had to sing two songs .
After that they chose the three best bands .
At this concert I saw a lot of popular singers .
I knew you love them and I got two autographs for you and of course for myself .
I was shocked because I had already spoken with them and I had got two autographs .
Another part of my experience at the pop concert when we meet each other .
I went to the Circle Theatre , three weeks ago , to see " Over the Rainbow " , the musical show that was playing at the time .
First of all , the actors mentioned in the advertisement were not those who performed in the show .
Then , if the show had started on time , it could have been much better , but it started forty - five minutes late , which is too much for me !
Plus , it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available . In fact , no discount was given to me , though I am a student and as a student I was entitled to get a discount but I paid Â£ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show .
Finally , I think that this evening was very far from being perfect , and I ask you for my money , which I spent on this horrible evening in your theatre , back .
Yours Faithfully
We can go faster with new technologies , from one place to another , for example , we can use a car or public transport such as the trains or buses instead of walking or riding as we did in the past .
Our everyday activities or family activities are simplified too . Washing the dishes or clothes by hand is rarely done , some special machines are made to do this stuff , it helps us to spend much more time in extra activities like sport , relaxing ...
New technologies allow us to work more efficiently ; with computers complex operations can be achieved in a short time and with the assurance that the result is correct .
The Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us , we can also inform ourselves about what is happening in the world , or search for a special hobby to get a quick result .
But firstly , I want to congratulate you on organizing such a huge festival , people need this kind of event .
Secondly , I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it .
As it said so in your advertisement , artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented . I was quite disappointed .
However the concerts were great , but unfortunately , some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as an oven inside .
The plays and films were good and I liked them , but there were only a few , I hope there will be many more next year .
One of the most positive aspects of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket .
As a student , the low priced ticket certainly attracted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists .
Finally , I would like to make one big suggestion : you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way do n't have to spend money on accommodation .
Young people always need money , especially students who do n't earn their living .
They need money to pay for their studies or for going out , but how to find a job which is good and not underpaid ?
Furthermore , department stores are always looking for students who would like to work .
Unfortunately , it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
If you are a really good student in one subject , you can provide private lessons , which is one of the most prolific jobs , but do it only if you like teaching .
The main thing to remember is that there are many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say : " I want to work and earn money " .
I am writing to thank you for the well - organised programme you have organised .
It will be a good opportunity to visit London and interesting places like the Science Museum .
In addition it is proper to mention that all the students in my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure Show , which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is an amazing show because there are parades with the latest fashions . We could see some famous top models . Also there will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs .
Also we could see the latest trend in make - up and hairstyles performed by important coiffeurs .
Maybe we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon and on Tuesday we could go to the show .
We would like to have a reply so we are able to begin making the arrangements .
Yours sincerely ,
I never imagined I would have to face this situation .
I joined an expedition in order to explore the Rocky Mountains .
We planned a route .
We arrived at the place in the morning and started to walk .
Everything was marvellous . I got on well with all the partners .
The landscape was the most beautiful that I had ever seen .
The weather was delightful , except for this afternoon when it started to rain and we decided to stay the night inside a hole in the face of the mountain .
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it , when a shower of stones covered the entrance of the hole .
I was terrified , I knew that the only solution was to ask for help .
I walked alone a long distance until I found a telephone . I called the police and they ask for a rescue .
Thank God , everything finished in a good way . And my companions were successfully rescued .
I 'd like to explain to you the problems I had when I went to the theatre .
The main problem I had was with the actor , because he was n't Danny Brook .
Another problem I had was with the time of the performance .
It was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining .
I 'd like to explain too that I did n't see you give any discounts to anyone .
I was queuing for a long time and I did n't see it happen .
And I went with a lot of friends and we did n't get any discount .
Another problem is that in the advertisement you said we could visit your restaurant but as it was closed we could n't .
And those are all the problems I had .
And , because of these problems , I 'd like to have my money back . If you do n't mind , of course .
We went to the same school and were in the same class .
I told her that and she assured me that she would n't say anything to him .
When we finished at our primary school we went to the same secondary school too , but we were in different classes .
We went out every weekend .
And when we finished at the secondary school , I decided go to a foreign University .
I spent five years there , although I came back every summer and we continued going out as we had done before .
When I finished I returned to my city to find a job .
one day , Pat told me that she was talking with this boy and that he told her that he liked me and immediately she told him that I liked him too .
A week after that I found him in a cafe and he asked me if I would like to be his girlfriend and I accepted .
Secondly , the show was really late starting .
It started at 20.15 , not at 19.30 as it was supposed to .
And , although you had promised them in your advertisement , there were no discounts available .
To make things worse , the restaurant was closed .
The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show on that date .
And , I would appreciate it if you gave me a refund .
I look forward to hearing from you .
In my opinion , the clothes will be more colourful , fun and comfortable .
I think that we will not wear formal clothes anymore .
People will prefer to wear comfortable clothes , even to go to the office .
The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more fun .
We will not wear black clothes as we used to .
People will wear yellow , pink and green clothes .
However , the clothes will not be like those teenagers wear nowadays to go to " raves " .
They will be more beautiful and clean .
They will wear an item of clothing only if they feel good wearing it .
Actually , I think that the clothes will be really simple in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then .
Now all the town knows my secret .
This is a very embarrassing situation .
This story started when I arrived in this town with my family .
We came here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires .
My mother suggested coming here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us .
I had n't met all of the family ( my uncle , my aunt and my beautiful cousin ) before that day .
My uncle , called Paul , invited us to stay with his family until we had built our house .
Coincidentally my cousin was the same age as me , sixteen , that 's the reason we started our friendly relationship .
We spent all our time together .
This " friendly " relationship was starting to get hot .
I had never had a boyfriend and I fell in love with him .
I felt that I had discovered other ways .
In fact , I had .
I am writing to express my pleasure about the successful programme that you have prepared for our school , especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery .
We are really interested in the latest fashions and new hairstyles , and also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and the girls especially enjoy seeing the different kinds of make - up .
Furthermore , we have been informed that students are allowed to visit this exhibition free .
This event takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall in London , on Tuesday the 14th of March .
If you agree to a visit to this exhibition , we will spend the day there , thus we should cancel the shopping , but we will be able to purchase some presents the next day , as you have not organised a specific plan .
I had to hit a human being and unfortunately , although I respect every form of life , humans , animals and plants , I managed to hit a burglar .
Three months ago , I can not forget this day , my parents visited my aunt in hospital as she was ill .
A short man was standing in front of me !
Without any warning , he pushed my arms .
I shouted as it hurt .
I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him , I found a hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him .
My name is Yakimo Nashoto . I study in France and I went to London just to see " Over the Rainbow " because all my friends told me that it was " great " .
However , when I saw it , I was really disappointed and I must ask you for some money back .
The reasons why I was disappointed are as follows :
First of all , Danny Brook was not there . I was very upset because he is my favourite singer and that was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show .
Then , the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
My Euro Star was at 22.00 .
On the development , they also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty - five years old but that was totally wrong because I paid the full price , which was Â£ 20 .
Finally , I wanted to buy something to drink , but the restaurant was closed because it was a bank holiday !
In conclusion , it was the worst evening I have ever had in my life so I must ask you for my money back .
Yours faithfully ,
Modern technology has changed my daily life a lot .
First of all , the Internet makes my life easier .
Some of my friends live overseas . We keep in touch with e - mails . It is a very good way to communicate because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re - read e - mails and keep them forever .
Also , nine people out of ten have a mobile phone in our society . I have one too !
when I want to call someone , I do n't need to look for a phone box ;
people can phone me at any time they want from anywhere
when I go out , sometimes my parents are worried so they phone me to see if everything is alright .
Finally , there is a TV in my parents ' car .
We can watch TV . There is also a map so when we get lost , it is very easy to find out the place .
In conclusion , I agree that modern technology has changed my daily life but I am sure that , in the future , my life will not be the same as now because more modern technology will appear .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " .
First , the advertisement said that the show was starring Tina Truelove and Danny Brook . That was not true . Danny Brook did not act in the show , there was a different actor and I was disappointed with him .
Regarding the times of the performance , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 . Nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenery .
The advertisement said that there were discounts available . That was false , there was not any kind of discount .
After all that I just wanted to go to the theatre restaurant and have something to eat , but it was closed because the police had closed it .
They had closed it because they had found the food in a bad condition .
Just to finish , the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out , let me tell you that it was not .
I paid for a full - price ticket without discount to wait 45 minutes , to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all that could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed .
I think the theatre should give me my money back and I hope you do .
Technology has changed , is changing and it will change our daily lives .
Now we can cook in an easier way than ten years ago , we can talk with somebody who is 10000 kilometres from us and we can know what 's happening in another part of the world .
Another thing that is changing our lives is the computer , especially the Internet .
More and more people are connecting to the net .
Soon we wo n't need to leave our homes .
Now we can buy everything via the Internet , we can see what 's happening on Wall Street , we can send mail in an easier way , by e - mail , and many people have started to work at home with their computers .
Technology has changed our daily lives so much that we wo n't be able to live without it .
Nobody can imagine living without a TV , a computer , a microwave , a telephone .
There are machines for everything , writing , cooking , going from one place to another , talking with somebody who is not with you .
Our lives are very different from our grandparents ' lives and that 's because of technology .
I am writing to complain about a musical show which is called " Over The Rainbow " and ask for my money back .
First of all , the poster told me that this show starred Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there were different actors .
Secondly , the show was meant to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
I was waiting for 45 minutes .
As you know the show started late , so , I was not able to go to the theatre restaurant because it closed before the show finished .
Thirdly , there were no discounts available but it was printed on the poster .
If there are no discounts , do n't write it on the poster .
I got confused and was disappointed again .
Finally , I would like to have my money back . I am looking forward to your prompt reply and improvement .
So , modern technology is needed to meet the requirement .
Every single day , a lot of modern technology is produced and it really affects our daily life .
The most important development is the Internet , which is connected to the whole world 's computers by telephone lines .
You can send a letter to your friend by e - mail instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post .
How convenient it is !
There are also many more advantages . You can buy something in a supermarket by only a mail order . You do n't need to leave your home .
Other than the Internet , there is also a lot of modern technology which is changing our daily life .
For example , we can go to Mars and do some research .
Some modern technology is also put into the transport system .
Modern technology has changed our daily life .
It aims to improve our standard of life and allows us to live more comfortably .
Dear Sir , I 'm writing this letter to you because I 'm very disappointed and I believe you have to give me some money back .
Before I bought my ticket and made train and hotel reservations I 'd read a lot of good reviews of that show and I thought it would be a great event to share with friends .
Firstly , your advertisement is a real lie .
Then the show was late starting , we had been waiting for a long long time before it started .
I saw a young actor who I 've never seen before and who did not seem to know his role by heart !
After that " show " we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurant but what a surprise !
It was n't at all a perfect evening . I 'm not pleased .
To summarize , I want you to give me my money back and very quickly .
Yours faithfully ..
Modern technology had changed the daily lives of human beings long before I was born .
Nowadays , in my opinion , the most important revolution is connected with new technologies .
Let 's take the mobile phone .
Our parents used the phone to make important appointments .
Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is " mobile " .
And I 'm no different , I 've got one and it has changed my everyday life .
I can always be reached , I can phone friends when I know I will be late and thanks to that device I feel less nervous and now I 'm sure I could n't live without it .
It 's the same with the Internet and that 's a very new thing .
I send and receive more e - mails than letters !
I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I 'm working because it takes just a few minutes .
With the Internet and , in my opinion , the world is becoming smaller and bigger at the same time .
Yes my daily life has changed and it 's a good thing .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about your fake advertisement .
You are the theatre 's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain to .
First of all , in your show advertisement it says that Danny Brooks stars in the play .
But a different actor was starring and that was very disappointing , not only for me but for all the people there .
The show began late , much later than your advertisement says , at about 20:15 .
The show started 45 minutes late .
This made me feel bored .
You also say in your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there were n't any .
At the end you said that the theatre restaurant after the show but it was n't .
It was closed because of the late start of the show .
Finally , because I did n't have a perfect evening but a very disappointing one , I have the right to ask for my money back .
Modern technology has changed not only my daily life but also the lives of many people .
First of all , I do n't have to worry in the morning about missing the bus because I have my alarm clock to wake me in time .
Usually , when I return from school the food is a little bit cold so I put it in the microwave to make it hotter .
When I go to sleep after I eat my lunch ( in my country , especially in summer it , is too hot )
I turn on the air conditioning with a timer so when I go to sleep it turns off by itself .
When I wake up , if I do n't have homework I sit at my computer and play different games to occupy my time .
In the evenings before I go to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV via satellite .
When I go to bed , because there are many mosquitoes , I turn on a special machine with a battery - like thing in it which kills them .
I believe that modern technology has positively affected our lives .
I am really pleased to hear from you that I won the prize .
As regards your questions , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am a student and my summer holiday will start on 27th June so I can go to the U.S.A in July and I prefer staying in tents because I have never experienced camping in a tent .
In the case of swimming , I am really good at it but I just started playing tennis 3 weeks ago .
However , I am really enjoying playing tennis .
Actually I have never been camping so I really have no idea about that .
Do you know if there are some occasions to spend money or not ?
I am really looking forward to going camping
We would like to thank you for this London trip and your programme for it .
It is a really good programme , and in particular visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery would be a great opportunity to learn about art and the the latest advances in science .
However , my classmates and I saw the advertisement regarding the London fashion and leisure show , which is enclosed , and want to take this opportunity to visit it , if you allow us .
It takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March .
It will be a great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear , new hairstyles and make - up .
Although according to your programme , we will be visiting the Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon , we would like to make a suggestion which can allow us to do both .
Would it be possible to visit the Science Museum and go shopping in our free time on Wednesday in the afternoon , and instead of that to go to the London fashion and leisure show , because it is between 10.00 and 19.00 hours .
Thanking you in advance , we very much hope that you will give your attention to our request .
We look forward to hearing from you regarding this matter .
One of the most important aims of the media is to inform people about famous people such as politicians , films stars or successful musicians .
In order to fulfil their readers ' requirements they constantly follow them .
It is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not . They just try to find the best pose .
After taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them , they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission .
This is the most contentious point .
Do they have to ask for their permission or not ?
However , if they asked , obviously they could not take the kind of pictures which show them naked or when they are having a shower .
Maybe they would have to pay for these kinds of pictures .
On the other hand , famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures , because although they are famous they also have their private life .
Unless they do not want to share it , we must accept this .
It was said that they had that accident while they were trying to escape from the paparazzi , which ended their lives .
This should not be the way in finding information for the readers .
Thank you very much for your programme , but we have another plan - to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which unfortunately is on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum . So we would like you to change the plan a little .
Your programme is very good , especially as we can go to visit the Science Museum , which I heard is very good , but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles and it is free for students too .
So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and doing the shopping after the show .
I climbed up the tree .
If I had n't borrowed it from him , I would n't have been there .
No , it was n't the time to regret it , just get it and it would be all over .
I stretched my arm , the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg .
It was badly hurt . My friend rushed to me , then ran back to my house and called Mum .
Mum came in , looking very angry . I prayed for a short conversation .
I want to complain about your advertisement for the production ' Over the Rainbow ' ; I had a very disappointing evening .
First of all , I wanted so much to see my favourite actor Danny Brook as he was supposed to be in the show , but he was n't .
Secondly the show did n't start until 20:15 but it should have started at 19:30 so we had to sit and wait , which was very boring .
There were no discounts on the tickets available either .
After the show we wanted to have something to eat in the theatre restaurant but it was closed for refurbishment .
She had always been like that , my best friend Ann said to me when I told her that I had told Pat a secret the day before .
The secret was that I was in love with Peter from my course .
Yesterday when I arrived at college , I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strangely at me and laughing .
In the classroom it became even worse .
People started to write things on the board and to point at me .
In the lunch break I went to Pat and asked her why she had told him the secret , but she just ignored me like she did n't know me .
I am writing this letter to complain about the musical show that the Circle Theatre company put on a few days ago .
Nothing the advertisement said was done properly .
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty - five minutes we were waiting for the show to begin .
It is a great failing of responsibility for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one .
Secondly , another thing that disappointed me was the actor that played the main role .
He was not Danny Brook , and the main reason that I went to see this show was the opportunity to see him acting .
I am a fan of his .
When I went to get the ticket , and the woman told me that the discounts were not available I knew that it would n't be a good night .
Finally , the restaurant where I would have liked to have dinner with friends after the show was closed , contrary to what was announced in the advertisement .
Nobody told us the reason for these problems .
These are the reasons why I am complaining , and I would like to know if there will be any refunds .
I will be waiting for news from you .
Perhaps , modern technology has changed my lifestyle but I do n't think so because I was born in the period of modern developments .
Since I was born I have lived with technological instruments like personal computers , mobile phones , television , etc .
And the development of them does n't worry me , as it does people who are against technology .
The only thing I can say about technology is that it has driven my life .
Modern technology captures my imagination , and this is the reason why I have chosen a career in electronics .
I do n't think technology changes lifestyle .
It is the lifestyle or needs of people that make technology develop .
All kinds of industrial machines are created to solve problems , improve other machines or to save time .
But these machines bring new problems that must be solved by others .
I 'm writing to answer your questions but , first of all , to thank you for the prize .
I would like to travel in July because it is the school holiday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel , so I have no preference for which weeks .
I do n't mind staying in log cabins , but I prefer camping because I want to be really close to nature .
Well , about the activities , I love Photography . I did a course and I would like to take beautiful photos of the Camp .
And I always was good at swimming . Now I 'll be at the Camp during the summer I think it is a good idea .
I do n't know how much money I 'll need for the trip or what kind of clothes I 'll need .
Do you have any night plan , like going to discos or nightclubs ?
Can you give me this information ?
I 'm looking forward to receiving your letter .
Yours sincerely
Nowadays shopping is one of the activities that makes our society live .
The cities are the main commercial centres , our streets are full of billboards advertising many things , as does TV either .
Despite this shopping culture , shopping is not always enjoyable . When you need to buy something you have to look for the best price , which is always a work of time , and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper , it must be crowded .
The solution could be an alternative way of making shops like the Internet .
You can buy anything without any problem . This is a good thing although it prevents poor people from shopping , because you have to have a computer .
Anyway , other alternatives to shopping are being created and we can choose not to waste our time shopping .
The Manager of the Circle Theatre .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you concerning your advertisement for the show at the Circle Theatre .
I have to say that I am really disappointed with your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true .
Firstly I 'd like to complain about the actors in the show .
In your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appeared on the stage that night .
Secondly , another problem was the starting time . According to your advertisement , the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at 20:15 , this is almost an hour 's delay .
Moreover , there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount , something that was n't true .
Furthermore in your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play , but the restaurant was closed and I 'd like to know why .
I am very disappointed with the whole situation and I am not happy to ask for a money refund .
The 21st century is also known as the golden century of high technology and science .
Many things have changed within the last 100 years .
Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into an ever - growing monster .
Every single day we hear about new products , new methods , new technological miracles which have turned our daily lives upside down .
The simplest example of modern high technology is the introduction of the computer - better known as the PC .
Research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC . Some people use them for their job because they need it , but others , like children , use it just for fun .
Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the TV , the microwave , the video , the satellite dish , the CD player and hundreds of others .
All these play an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them .
We have all turned into pathetic , technological robots .
Those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable , but they take us away from our friends , our families and moreover they lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive .
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00 . I was really amazed by the news that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
With regard to the date that I would like to travel it must be July 15th because my classes will finish at the end of June and I 'm going to have some free time from this date until early August when I will start to work .
I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in a log cabin .
I think that is going to be more comfortable for me due to the fact that I am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I ca n't take the risk of catching a cold , because as you know , I 'm going to start to work .
The activities that I would like to do there are the following:- Singing ( I 'm a very good singer ) ; swimming , I 'm not good at all at this one , but I enjoy spending time in the water , I really do .
Would you be so kind as to let me know what kind of weather you have in July in order that I can choose the right clothing to bring . And also I would like to know approximately the amount of money that I should bring for the items that are not included .
How are you ? I 'm fine and I am writing to you because I know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert ; I have to tell you that I did help there and it was very hard work . You ca n't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert .
I really enjoyed the opportunity to talk with well - known stars and to learn how to set up everything for a concert .
If you have the opportunity to do this do n't miss out .
I hope to see you soon to give you more details .
I am writing to you to complain about the last Saturday evening performance at your theatre .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook , but a substitute , and the theatre had not notified the audience about this change before the performance .
Secondly , the show started 45 minutes late . We could not get any discounts on the price and no worker wanted to give us an explanation for that .
After the show , we decided to go to the restaurant for dinner , but it was closed for repairs .
Everything was completely different from what you had announced in the advertisement
I am sure you understand why I am so upset and you will do your best to give me satisfaction , I mean , refunding me exactly what I paid for this terrible evening .
Modern technology has changed my daily life , making it easy , with less effort and time spent on .
A simple example , we can , at the same time , wash our clothes in a washing machine , record a TV programme and talk to someone on the other side of the world .
All this in one morning , and the day has just begun , what is to do next ?
Technology allows us to have more time for leisure or for other things we really like to do . We can take care of those we love and give them more attention ; time is not really a problem .
We will see people differently , more calmly , because we suffer no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
We will be more understanding with others .
It is the first step towards a true fraternity .
All this modern technology increases the level of waste products that can not be easily destroyed .
Living better , people live longer and it is necessary to produce more food , but more food means chemical agents on the earth , the circle never stops .
In conclusion , modern technology allows me to live better and to have more time to do what I really like , although , I know , all this has a price .
Thank you for sending me this wonderful news . I was really happy when I learned I won the first prize .
I am writing to give you my details and ask for some more information .
I am a college student and I am going to study at university this year .
I will take my exams in June and have the results in August .
Secondly , I prefer staying in log cabins so that I can have more chances to be with other people , then I can make more friends .
During the camp , I will do singing and climbing activities .
I enjoy singing all the time and I want to share my music with others .
Finally , I want to know what the weather is like in California in July .
Do I need some special clothes for the camp and how much money shall I bring for other expenses ?
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
To : The teacher of the English class
Subject : The lessons that should be filmed
Date : 13 June 00
Introduction :
The English class is going to make a short video about the school 's daily life .
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about which lessons and activities should be filmed .
The Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students to talk about some topics they choose and discuss them with others in order to improve their speaking and listening skills .
The topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up to date .
The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals , sports , museums , etc .
It is popular with the students .
The canteen is the place students get together apart from class .
Quite a lot of students spend their free time there relaxing and talking .
Basketball is the most popular activity , which takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week .
Not only the students who have activity play but also a lot of students watch .
The lessons and activities above are what we suggest should be filmed .
I have received your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize .
I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time for me to go on holiday because the 12th of July is my birthday .
I want to sleep in tents because I think it 's more adventurous with better scenery , and atmosphere .
You also asked me about the two things I 'm good at . Well , the first one is basketball .
I have been playing basketball for roughly 4 years .
I have been playing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 's U.S open tournament last summer .
Will I have to bring many clothes i.e. will we do a lot of outdoor activities , get dirty etc ?
Will I need a lot of money ?
Looking forward to seeing you soon .
People today shop seven days a week with their family , friends etc .
This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are producing in the world .
The more stuff we buy , the more we throw away .
Therefore you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy .
For example , you can do sports , which are enjoyable and good for your health .
Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports , which are good for you .
You must think about your children , who will be living in the world you helped to destroy .
I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping is n't always enjoyable and change your views regarding shopping .
I 'm writing to complain about your theatre and its show last night .
Firstly I would like to say that I was very disappointed with the show and that I did n't have the perfect evening out , as advertised .
I do n't know where to start .
The main character of the musical show , who I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " , was awful .
His acting was not good and he did n't seem to like acting . Even my son could act better .
After the terrible acting of your star , comes the starting time .
I was sitting waiting for forty - five minutes until the play started .
You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15 , as it did .
And then , when I arrived at the theatre , I expected to have a discount but unfortunately I did n't .
On top of all this , the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef and the waiters were on holiday .
You could hire other staff to do the work .
I was very disappointed , what else can I say .
It was supposed to be my perfect evening out .
I am asking for my money back .
In conclusion , I 'd like to recommend that you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it .
Yours sincerely
Helena
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I should n't have told her that my dad had psychological problems .
I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell my brother .
It all started when I was about 10 years old , as my brother is now , and I overheard my mother talking about my father and his problems to my aunt . I was hurt inside and cried till my tears ran dry .
All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accident .
I was living a lie .
Now at the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake of mentioning this problem to my " friend " Pat .
I knew that she was close to my brother and that she loved him a lot , so I never thought that things would turn out like this .
When one day Pat came over to my house , we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up .
Pat started shouting and screaming , saying what was really going on .
He stood outside my door and heard every single word .
When I realised , it was too late .
The secret had been revealed .
And now I try to help my brother because I 've been there , in his place , and I know how it feels .
I am so grateful and I ca n't believe I am so lucky to receive your letter in which you said that I have won the first prize in your competition , of two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A.
I am writing to inform you that I can only go in July , the summer holiday , because I have got a place at university and it will start in August .
Is the time I request available ?
I would also like to ask accommodation you offer is in tents or log cabins .
If I can choose I would prefer tents .
I ca n't wait to do my painting of the rising sun , and ca n't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers will be .
Finally , can you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me , and how much spending money will be needed .
Sometimes when I 'm bored and ca n't find something else to do ,
I go look round the shops .
When I see some clothes in the window I like , I go in and try them on .
But I always find they do not look nice on me .
The other thing I do n't like going shopping is at the weekend .
All the shops are full of people , and people treat the items like rubbish , hanging them everywhere after they have tried them on and found that they did not suit them .
Also with weekend shopping , you ca n't find somewhere to sit down comfortably to have a cup of tea .
Mc . Donnals , K.F.C , are all full of people .
However , shopping is a nice way to spend your leisure time and give yourself a chance to relax sometimes , but I suggest that you never do it at the weekend .
According to your advertisement , it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE , but surprisingly , was performed by a different actor of whom I did n't even know the name .
In addition , the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started half an hour later , at 20:15 .
To make matters worse , I had expected to get a discount on the ticket , but when I went to the ticket office , there was not any discount available .
You can imagine how disappointed I was , spending money on such a terrible evening .
I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insist on getting some money back .
Nowadays , we use a lot of modern technology both at home and the in office but it has its advantages and disadvantages .
The first and most important thing is that modern technology has made our life easier , for instance the rice cooker is a great invention , all you have to do is put rice in it and switch it on , it makes cooking more efficient .
Furthermore , we use the computer and telephone a lot .
It is often suggested that modern technology makes the gap bigger between people , they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings .
To sum up , I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not always rely on it .
Spending a week in London on holiday last week , I decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show .
Unfortunately , I had a really disappointing evening !
Indeed , first , the performance did n't start at 19:30 as it was meant to according to the advertisement but 45 minutes later ( 20:15 ) .
Then , the actors ( Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ) who were mentioned in the advert and were supposed to perform were n't present .
There were different actors who took their roles .
I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are such great actors and I was very excited about seeing them .
Furthermore , in the advertisement I got , it was written that the theatre restaurant was open .
I told myself , I could eat over there and maybe have a better evening than I was having at the beginning of the show but I was n't lucky because the restaurant was closed !
No reasons were given .
As you can see , the perfect evening I had expected was a nightmare ; that 's why I would be pleased if you gave me my money back because I can not tolerate such a thing !
From the beginning of the century to now , modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier .
Indeed , modernisation helps us to lead a more comfortable and better life than before .
For example , cars and planes are wonderful inventions ! A few centuries ago , it took many hours ( even several days ) to go from one city to another or to travel abroad .
People could n't think of such innovation in our world and yet , it was created .
Mankind became more and more clever and built wonderful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands .
Communication has made many advances too .
Everyone has a television at home . "
Although there are new machines etc , medicine makes many discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer .
Thus , modern technology seems to be a positive way to improve our daily life .
I have won the first prize ! I am extremely happy about this .
I am writing because of some information that you need .
I can only take a holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginning of August .
When I was a child we often camped .
Staying in a tent will remind me of an unforgettable time .
There are a lot of interesting activities and that makes it hard to choose only two .
Given the circumstances , I would like to learn more about photography and painting .
I have some skills in landscape drawing but I have no idea about photography .
Taking pictures is a new experience for me .
I have never been to California .
Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I take travellers ' cheques ?
Yours sincerely
I could n't write to you because I was very busy .
I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hoped to see a lot of different people .
Given the circumstances , they asked me to help in the kitchen .
But it turned out to be a fun and interesting job .
I had to prepare the ingredients for every meal .
That meant I had to read the recipes very carefully .
And I had to check that nothing was missed .
The best thing was that I got a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks .
I had a lot to do and I was never bored .
The time went quickly and it was a great experience .
Warm wishes
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you to complain about the show " Over the Rainbow " at your theatre " The Circle Theatre " .
I am deeply disappointed with the service and the unreliable information at your theatre .
I attended your show one evening , during my stay in London .
I am very disappointed by this .
You also mention that your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at 20:15 and that meant forty - five minutes of waiting .
It also mentioned other services would be available to the audience .
For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show , when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance .
Lastly , your advertisement stated clearly that this would be " Your perfect evening out ! " but sadly it was a real waste of time for me .
And I would like a refund . You have wasted my evening and money .
Yours faithfully ,
In the past 100 years , fashion has changed a great deal .
Nowadays clothes are designed to be more comfortable .
The material and colours of your clothes have changed since the early 1900s .
Synthetics have been created by scientists .
Clothes are now mass - produced and designed by designers .
Designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes .
It is hard to imagine what people will wear in 100 years ' time , because since the 1900s clothes have reduce into smaller item and more practical .
Maybe it would continue reducing in 100 years to come .
Scientists might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde .
It could be that you will carry a small round box .
It would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you want to wear by pressing buttons .
This would be very easy to manage but it would mean no more shopping for girls .
It would be scary to live in the new 100 years , but it would be interesting to see what will happen .
Hopefully everybody would n't be walking around naked .
Thank you , it was great to hear about my prize .
You ask me for some information - here it is .
First I can travel only in July , because I ca n't get any free time in any other month .
The next thing is that I would prefer a log cabin .
About the activities at the camp , I can tell you that I like to play tennis and I play it very well .
Another thing I want to try , if possible , is to play golf .
It 's a very popular sport in our region ( area ) also , but I have never found time to do it .
I 'm a beginner at golf you have to know .
Now a question from me to you : is it possible to pay for the different things by credit card ?
Another question - what sort of clothes shall I bring with me ?
Is July a hot and dry month or does it rain sometimes ?
I think this will be all I want to know .
If there are any other questions on your part , please call me or write again .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you ,
yours faithfully
Sorry , I 'm late I know , but now I will tell you something about my experience last month .
The concert started on the 15th of May and it was a really great session in our valley .
I was so happy when they asked me to help them with the organisation .
I was responsible for the advertisements and I also had to invite the " important people " from our government .
It was really a new job for me , but I think I did well .
I 've learned a lot about management and especially how stars live .
One evening we all went out for dinner and after we went to a new disco .
Now Kim , I will finish my letter but I promise to write again as soon as possible . Maybe if I 've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the ....
A good idea at least - you come here and I will tell you some other stories .
In the meantime enjoy your life -
Moreover , the show started late : instead of 19.30 ( the time in the advertisement ) people were allowed in at 20:15 , resulting in a waiting time of 45 minutes .
There were two other problems : there were no discounts , contrary to the information in the advertisement , and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repair work .
We are living in a technologically advanced world where we are surrounded by all sorts of devices which would seem fantastic to our ancestors .
I would rather type some course work up than hand - write it .
This makes my life easier , and at the same time saves some trees in a rain forest from being cut down .
When I am too tired to go out but want to meet some new people , computer technology provides me with the opportunity .
Using the Internet , I can meet people from all around the world without going anywhere .
First of all , I would like to say thank you for this good programme , especially for the decision to visit London .
All of us appreciate this opportunity .
Because most students have never been to London before . Also we can visit some famous places which we want to go to .
However , we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show as well .
This show takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 .
At this show , not only can we see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make - up and hairstyles , but we can also enter for free .
If you accept and would n't mind this idea , we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday .
Nowadays , quite a few famous people suffer in their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters .
I would like to discuss how the media affect famous people .
A few years ago , we had the terrible news of the death of Lady Diana .
She was always being pursued by the media .
Finally , after being chased for a long time , she was killed in a car accident .
It must be a good example of a media disaster .
However , she definitely deserved to have a private life as a citizen .
Human rights must exist for all people .
On the other hand , there are a few famous people who desire to be watched by the media .
If the media stopped focusing on these people , they would think that they have been put in a bin like rubbish .
Moreover , many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or in a magazine .
It is one of fun in our life .
Thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition . I also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition , thanks to which I have the opportunity to go to California , a place that I always wanted to go to .
About the trip , I think it would be preferable to do it in July , which is a holiday period and so I wo n't have any special obligations .
While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent , so I can be closer to nature .
Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do , especially during a holiday !
Moreover I would like it if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball .
Any little tournaments of this kind would be great .
Before ending my letter I would like to know in particular what kind of clothes I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine into dollars .
I look forward to hearing from you
As you know last month I went to help at a concert , the one that I told you about in my last letter .
I wanted to go there very much and so going there to help was for me a unique opportunity .
Moreover instead of buying a ticket I went there for free , as a helper .
From the first moment that I got there I understood that I was going to have a great night .
OK , in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do , such as cleaning the stage and some decoration work .
But when the concert started and we finished what we had to do , we were free to do whatever we wanted .
The pop concert was excellent and I had a lot of fun .
Do n't ask the time when I came home because I do n't remember !
Best wishes
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE PUT ON .
I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME . UNFORTUNATELY , THINGS WENT VERY WRONG .
FIRSTLY , IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE STAR WAS DANNY BROOK , AND THAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR .
SECONDLY , THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON , BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT ,
THAT IS FORTY - FIVE MINUTES LATER ! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE . HOWEVER , THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE .
LASTLY , AFTER THAT AWFUL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT , OF COURSE , I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
AS YOU CAN SEE , IT WASN'T MY PERFECT EVENING OUT ( AS YOU PROMISED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT ) , SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK .
UNFORTUNATELY , PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED THAT TOO LATE .
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE , I WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HER THAT I HAD FAILED MY MATHEMATICS EXAM .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH MY MOTHER .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , SO MY EXAM RESULTS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD .
AFTER THAT PAT INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CHARLY GARCIA CONCERT .
THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY , WHICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS .
I REALLY WANTED TO GO , AND I KNEW THAT MY EXAM HAD GONE BADLY , SO I TOLD MY MOTHER THAT I WOULD GET MY RESULTS THE NEXT MONDAY , SO MY MOTHER ALLOWED ME TO GO .
THAT FRIDAY , I KNEW THAT I HAD FAILED THE EXAM , AND PAT KNEW IT TOO . OF COURSE , I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT TELLING THAT TO MY MOTHER , BUT PAT CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD MY MOTHER , WITHOUT ANY INTENTION OF DOING SO .
Dear Mr. manager of The Circle Theatre :
I 'm writing to you to describe some problems with your theatre 's show . First I have to say to you that there was a different actor to the one advertised starring in the play .
I expected the star of the play to be Danny Brook and there was another man .
I 'm very disappointed with the time that the play started .
About the price , the paper that I have at home states that there were discounts available , if these discounts are real I could n't use them .
When the show had finished I could n't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed .
The reason they gave us was that they had n't got any waiters .
For all those reasons I have given you , I ask for the money I spent back .
I 'm sorry if I cause you any problem , but I 'm very angry and it was your fault .
I was fourteen years old and I was with my best friend , Pat .
We were in a private school , which looked like a castle , in London and we had been staying there for two months .
Our parents took us there because they wanted us to become good polite girls .
Life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to have fun there .
One day I discovered a secret path in the school . This path went from our bedroom to the director 's room .
I thought it was a good idea to tell Pat because we could use it to look for exams , and then we could pass all of them .
When I told her , she promised me that she would keep the secret .
But in a few days she told the secret to all the class . All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic secret path to look for exams .
Then somebody told a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents .
Nowadays , I remember this story as a bad experience .
I am writing this letter to you in order to complain about the musical show ( ' Over the Rainbow ' ) that was performed at your theatre last week ; concretely on Friday evening .
These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion of your company , which is said to be the best producer of musical shows in Europe .
With all these considerations in mind , I attended your theatre on the referred day with the aim of having a perfect evening .
However , nothing was further from what really happened .
To start with , it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts , even though I presented an official ISIC card .
Then , the audience had to wait 45 minutes past the announced time of the performance for the show to get started .
And finally , when they came on , we realised that it was not Danny Brook performing , which was really disappointing .
Actually , whereas they used to talk about how their daily lives had changed in comparison with previous generations ' , we remain astonished , looking at how our lives are changing frenetically .
We have hardly assimilated one piece of new technology when it is replaced or modified by another .
Electronic devices and ' gadgets ' make our daily lives more comfortable and easier , but does that mean that we live better than ever ?
Of course , they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines , giving us the chance to have more free time .
However , instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity , people have become hooked on technological advances , feeding back their development in an accelerating , non - stop race .
Machines now do most of the hard work , but this does not mean that we are working less .
People spend more and more time working , searching for new inventions that will make life easier , but then fail to profit from all the benefits obtained .
Thank you very much for taking us to London .
However , a few of us would like to consider the " London fashion and leisure show " .
This is going to take place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Could you , if we may ask , reorganise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping centre .
However , none of us wishes to miss all the attractions planned in the schedule .
Perhaps we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shopping centre .
Every one hopes to enjoy himself and come back with a lot of knowledge .
I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologise for any inconvenience it may cause .
I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show " .
On behalf of all the students ,
Yours truly ,
What do famous people want ?
Or do they want to be persecuted by the media ?
You are rich and loved .
Perhaps we could call it the " rough of the smooth " .
However , to have your photo taken and shown on television and the in newspapers increases your popularity .
It is the way you may consider magnificent wages as it should fit your fame .
I might also be missing the point .
You might be a princess , a politician or a footballer but are not doing it for any fame .
You were born with the talent or with the title .
You never wished to be so famous .
Whatever you do , journalists should not follow you every second .
Everyone deserves to be given the right to a private life .
I am writing to you to complain about the problem that happened in the play called " Over the rainbow " , and why I would like to get some money back .
The problem is that most of the advertisement was misleading .
First of all , there were no discounts on the tickets ' prices , and they were advertised .
Secondly , the play was advertised as starting at 19.30 , but it started at 20:15 .
Despite this fact , which I did not care about at first , when the play started I did not see Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor ; I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook .
But the main reason for my complaint , is that in the advertisement it was said it would be my perfect evening out , and it was not .
Therefore , for all these reasons , I would be happy to get some money back .
Technology has affected my daily life so much .
If I did not have it , I could not do most of the things that I do today .
First of all , if I did not have it , I would not be able to get out of the city because I would not have a car .
But we have it , and the thing that has changed my life most is the Internet .
Nowadays , with my computer , I can travel anywhere in the world , just by having it connected to a modem .
The Internet has changed my life because , with it , we can do everything at home .
For example if one day I forgot a book , I can find the book on the Internet , and more information too .
Another thing apart from the Internet and the car that has changed my life is the TV .
With the TV I can get all the information , moreover I can see films on it .
And the best thing is that it entertains me alone or with people .
In conclusion I think that without technology we could not live as well as we live now , and our lives would be so very boring .
I have just received your letter and I thank you for your invitation and congratulations .
I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction with your perfect organisation .
About the information requested from me , I have to say that I can travel only in July because of my job ; I am busy until the end of June .
As regards accommodation , I prefer a longer , Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting .
My favourite sports activities are playing tennis and basketball .
I like competitive and challenging sports . I enjoy comparing my skill with other players and , if possible , I would rather not do indoor sports activities , but open air ones .
I would like to know if special clothes are needed and what the weather is like that time of year .
I have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy .
The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaining problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject .
Also the sports activities should be filmed ; they express an aggregative and social way of living school life and can be useful to show the movements of the bodies during the school athletics events .
The dancing lessons should also be filmed , especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their movements .
I hope that these suggestions can be accepted and appreciated .
We bought tickets for the second show , which was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15 !
We were interested in seeing the actors that appeared on the tickets and I was very disappointed when , in the show , we saw other actors .
The tickets were more expensive than we had expected , but we did n't care because we saw on the tickets that there would be discounts given , but , they did n't give us discounts !
With all these problems , the only thing that kept us going was the thought of eating something .
When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because the staff did n't go to work that day .
So it was the worst evening that I had ever had .
I ask you to consider all my reasons and to return my money . I think that is the only thing you can do .
Thank you for your understanding
It was Saturday night , and I was with my sister Pat alone in my home .
That night I was invited to a great party , but I was being punished , and I had to stay at home with my sister .
My parents were away for the weekend .
When it was time to go to the party I decided to escape without telling my sister . Unfortunately when I returned she was waiting for me in my room .
When I entered my room she was very happy , because my father would punish me again . Of course , she would tell him , but I decided to pay her if she stayed quiet . She accepted and I paid her a lot of money .
On Sunday night , when my parents arrived , they asked her if I had stayed at home on Saturday . My sister stayed silent for a minute and then started laughing ; so my parents , with her laugh , knew that I had gone out that Saturday ; and punished me for a year .
You had a really great idea to create this sort of festival .
I had a lot of fun there .
I would come next year with great pleasure .
I hope you will not be angry if I give you some advice .
First , I would like to talk about your section " Stars and Artists " .
This section is really great and attracts a lot of people .
Because the spectators will probably be more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities .
The concerts are fabulous but the problem is the halls .
Could you do something about these problems ?
All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of " Plays and Films " . I love films and plays also , and I hope to have more films or plays next year .
It is a good idea to have reasonably - priced tickets for weekends .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
My exams start next month , that 's why I have a lot of work .
In your letter , you wanted to know about my school rules in France and you also wanted to know what I am or I am not allowed to do at home .
First ; .
You are not allowed to smoke , drink or to take drugs in my school .
You must be outside during the break .
You must sign your notebook to your parents every week .
You are not allowed to argue with your teacher after you receive an exam .
You must be on time at school or you get a punishment .
At home , I 'm not allowed to watch television after 8 p.m. I must do my homework when I come back home .
I must also help my parents with home activities .
For example , clean my room and the other rooms , or cook , etc ....
I hope this information will help you ,
Keep in touch .
Love ,
I am writing to you in order to answer your questions and to get some information I would like to have .
First of all , I want you to know I am really happy about the prize .
The only problem is that as I am a student I can travel only during the holidays , in July . Regarding accommodation I would rather stay in a tent because I have never been camping and I would like to try it .
I am not really keen on art . That is why I would prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing .
If I had to be honest , I would say I have never done either of them .
Yet , I would like to try them because my city is far from the sea so I do n't have many opportunities of doing them .
I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take .
Besides , I wonder if I will share a tent or not and if I have to bring it or if it will be provided by you .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
If I did n't tell you about my experience at the pop concert in detail in my last letter it was because I did n't have time .
A few months ago I chatted , via the Internet , to a nice guy from Buenos Aires who happened to be one of the members of " Los Pericos " .
They had to give a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me to where they were preparing the concert .
The problem was that one of the technicians was from England and nobody there spoke a word of English so I was asked to be the interpreter .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
I have just received your letter and I 'm very happy because of it , especially because the competition was so hard .
Being at Camp California was one of the dreams of my life and now I can realise it .
Firstly , I could spend these two weeks during next July only , because , before and after it , I have to work as a waiter here in my town .
However , about accommodation , I 'd prefer a log cabin , because it is more comfortable than a tent .
All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing , because I 'm used to playing tennis every weekend and I 'm very keen on surfing . I 'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too .
Lastly , I 'm interested in the law schools in California . They are very famous here .
This is a precise letter that I write to you now .
Last month I visited Tom , another old friend , and he told me I could work with him as a musician at the XZY pop concert .
Firstly , I was very embarrassed during the concert , but all the staff were very kind to me and Tom too .
This was the most important experience in my life , I knew all the people , in particular the famous singer " Kos " .
He is funny and easy going .
During the concert , I was near the and opposite there was " Pipe " the biggest in the world .
It 's very difficult describing all the emotions I felt .
I can only tell you that it had been an important experience for me and for my new songs .
Excuse me Kim , but I 'm so nervous that I wo n't be able to write even this letter .
I hope to hear from you soon
TO THE MANAGER OF " THE CIRCLE THEATRE " AFTER FINISHING A STRESSFUL YEAR AT SCHOOL , I TOOK A SHORT HOLIDAY , AND ITS " SPLENDID ENDING " WAS A WEEK IN LONDON . WHILE I WAS THERE , I SAW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SIGN : " OVER THE RAINBOW " THE MUSICAL WAS PLAYING AT YOUR THEATRE , MOREOVER , THE WONDERFUL DANNY BROOK WAS THE STAR IN IT .
WE ASKED ABOUT " THE DISCOUNTS " THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING THE TICKETS COULD SAY WAS :
WHILE WE WERE WAITING , WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT , AND THEN WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED .
I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T A PLEASURE FOR US TO SEE THE SHOW , SO I HOPE YOU CAN GIVE ME OUR MONEY BACK , IF YOU CAN'T , PLEASE , AT LEAST GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION .
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS THE HISTORY OF WORLD CONQUEST . THAT SAID , TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN 'S EVOLUTION . FURTHERMORE , DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES , THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION . WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM ENGINE , FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB , THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US NUCLEAR ENERGY ( AND SADLY ATOMIC WEAPONS ) , THE COMPUTER , THE INTERNET AND TELEVISION .
TODAY , I CAN DO MOST OF MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK WITH THE COMPUTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND IT DOESN'T WEIGH MORE THAN AN APPLE !
I CAN READ ALL THE NEWS AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS IN THE VIRTUAL NEWSPAPERS AND I CAN TALK WITH MY FOREIGN FRIENDS THANKS TO THE ICQ PROGRAM . I HAD NEVER USED THE INTERNET BEFORE , BUT IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE , AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE .
A few days ago , as I was having a week 's holiday in London , I read your advertisement , which convinced me to go to see your show : Over The Rainbow .
First of all , I was very disappointed by the fact that the actors who performed were not the ones who were supposed to be there !
I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , as was written in your ad !
Finally , at the end of this very disappointing evening , I decided to go to the theatre restaurant - which was also mentioned in your ad - but I was told that this was closed for a private party !
To put it in a nutshell , contrary to what was described in the advertisement , it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back .
Actually , even though she was seventeen , she still behaved like a ten - year - old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret , for example .
Thus when Sally explained to her that she had fallen in love with Kevin , Pat felt very awkward .
It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not , she would have preferred not to know it .
Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret , Pat ran away , went home , and locked herself in her bedroom .
13 June 2000
I 'd like to tell you that the best month for me to travel to the U.S.A . is July because I will be on holiday in that month .
I do n't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California , but if I can tell you which one I prefer I 'll choose to stay in a tent .
This is because it will be more exciting and fun than not in log cabins .
From the list of activities at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next July .
I am looking forward to hearing from you very soon .
I am so glad to know that you and your family are well .
It was so easy . I mean we just carried all the instruments of the musicians to the Club and we put them on the stage .
After this , we helped at the service bar , putting all the drinks and refreshments into the fridges .
I enjoyed doing this a lot and at least the gig was free for all of us .
The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out . Marvellous !
Well , Kim , I hope to see you soon and take care .
Two days before I read an advertisement for this show , which said that Danny Brook was starring .
Unfortunately , last evening there was a different actor and that was very disappointing .
Apart from that , the show started at 20:15 , not at 19:30 , as it said in the advertisement and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished .
I am in London for a week and I have to say that last evening I had an awful time , so I want some of my money back .
I am looking forward to receiving your reply with my money .
Yesterday afternoon , when I went home , my mother wanted to talk to me about something , so I went into her bedroom to speak to her .
She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went to a party without asking her and that she had to punish me for that .
She told me that I had to stay at home at the weekend and not go out with my friends .
When I went to my bedroom I realised that Pat had told my mother about the party , because no one else knew that my mother did not know that
Pat is not a reliable person , so he is not my best friend anymore .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show the , name of which is Over the Rainbow , which I saw in your theatre recently .
I like this musical very much and while I was spending some days in London I saw your advertisement so I decided to go to see it .
First of all , I had problems with tickets because I could not get the discounts that you mentioned in the advertisement .
It was a pity but it did not annoy me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay Â£ 20 for .
So I entered the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight ( three quarters of an hour late ) .
Then I got irritable and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained to us the reasons the show was late starting why .
In your advertisement his name was in big letters and in the musical there was a different actor .
After the show I decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarette to try to calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman 's day off .
I am very indignant because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you to return my money and take note of all these problems .
A long time ago technology was n't an important thing for people because they did n't appreciate it .
Change was n't common and Governments did n't invest enough money in it .
My computer is faster and it is able to do a lot of things that I wasted a lot of time on before .
Not only are computers useful for storing information but also computers can give you a lot of information thanks to the Internet .
On the other hand , I realise that modern technology is not as good as people think : I hate mobiles .
I know that some people need them to work but I ca n't understand why teenagers need them .
Maybe it would be a nice idea to analyse these changes and to put limits on technology , because I think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it .
Firstly , the show did not start on time but forty - five minutes late .
This made me a little bit angry because I already had trouble buying a ticket earlier : although it was proclaimed in the advertisement , there were no Â£ 15 and Â£ 10 discounts available .
That was why I was really shocked to see that there was another actor playing his role .
This actor was not nearly as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paid so much money if I had known this before .
Like everything that else had gone wrong that evening , the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill !
I am convinced I have the right to some money back from you because none of your promises was carried out .
I heard somebody say , " Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations " .
The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular : an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea , fighting with a strong fish he has caught .
What makes the situation difficult is that neither of the two characters wants to give up .
It becomes a life and death struggle .
He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and nature .
So he bears everything : the days and nights on the sea , without any food or water , the terrible summer sun , being injured from keeping hold of the line on which the fish is caught .
The reader feels for him , wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up .
Although this situation might not be very difficult or important for anybody else , it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until quiet , sad end .
17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir , I am writing to complain about various things which I am very disappointed with .
I went to the theatre to see the musical show called ' Over the Rainbow ' .
There I met with many problems .
First of all , I bought four tickets for Â£ 20 each and discounts were not available .
Secondly , I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the time of the performance was 9:30 .
However , the show started at 20:15 . I was fed up with waiting .
The worst thing of all was that at the beginning of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised .
They were worse than the previous actors .
After the show , my friends and I were very furious because of all this .
I am really annoyed .
In my opinion , you have to give us back us money because everything that you wrote in your advertisement was not true .
I hope to get your answer soon .
Finally , I want to tell you this is the last time that I come to your theatre .
I have gone out onto the street and I have asked people this question .
I have recollected all the answers and I have written this article .
Most people think that character , person and clothes are of a piece .
They believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing , amusing , etc .
I really think that living in the future will be like living on the moon - very exciting .
And people will wear cybernetic clothes but at the same time comfortable clothes .
From my point of view , they will enjoy themselves more than people do now because they will have many things to do .
On the other hand , most people in the future will wear glasses .
That is because sunlight is very bad .
In the end everyone will be short - sighted .
In conclusion , I would like to live in the future to see exactly what clothes they will wear .
It is a very interesting subject .
I received your letter recently , and I am really happy to learn that I have won the first prize .
First of all , I have to tell you that my only chance to go there is in July ; the dates do not matter , but it is important for me to be back before the 1st of August , because that day I will start a summer job .
About the accommodation during those two weeks , I would rather stay in a log cabin , as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little close room .
Your next question is about the activities that I could do at the camp . After browsing through the list , I would like to take part in climbing and photographic activities , as these are my favourite hobbies .
I had an induction climbing course two years ago , and I still climb regularly . I can do a V+ level climb .
On the other hand I took a photography course five years ago , and I took part in several competitions .
Looking forward to your answer .
Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular . The shopping centres are always busy , with people going up and down carrying bags and looking in shop windows ; it seems everybody is happy .
Sometimes things can go wrong and the situation changes and becomes a nightmare .
Firstly there is the parking problem . If you go shopping late at weekends for instance , it 's really difficult to find a place to park your car , and when you get a place , to you have pay for it !
Then the search for a nice item of clothing starts , and when eventually you get it , it is n't your size , and also the colour that you like is not available .
Finally you 've found something really wonderful - time to pay !
In the hurry you 've forgotten to bring any cash , but you can use your plastic money . The shop assistant passes the credit card through the machine , after a few seconds he does it again , and does it another time . Suddenly his face changes and he tells you that the card is faulty !
No choice : you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad .
To sum up , shopping is not always enjoyable , but do n't worry , the shopping centre is still there waiting for you !
Dear Helen Ryan ,
I can only travel in July because this is the month when I have holidays .
I 've already talked to my manager , and she said that that 's the only month I can have my holidays .
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it must be cold staying in a tent .
I have some problems with my kidneys , so I ca n't stay in one of the tents , and also it must be very comfortable staying in a log cabin .
I 've been playing Golf for five years , and I 've a handicap of sixteen , but the problem is that I haven't been playing Golf for a long time because I work every day .
I 've been playing tennis since I was seven , and I 've been studying how to play tennis for a very long time , nine years .
I would like to know what kind of clothes I need to take with me , and can you write to me about what kind of weather it 's going to be there , for the time I will be staying there .
Also I would like to know how much money I should take with me , because I 'm not sure how much I 'll need to spend there .
See you , Mrs Helen Ryan , and please write back .
I wish you had been there with me helping at a pop concert .
I just loved it . I was working with this music system .
You know how good I am at music Anyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds . At the beginning I was connecting all these wires into speakers , music system , guitars etc ... The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us .
I asked one of the cameramen when they 're going to show this show on tv , and he told me they 're going to show it on the 10 of June , so turn on your tv on this date , channel three , and you will see me there playing this guitar . AH , it was lovely .
These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see this pop concert . Believe me , you 'll love it and you might play the drums . I told them that you 're really good on drums so they want to try you too .
I 'll write to you soon Kim .
Say hello to your parents !
I would like to thank you for the first prize in your competition : two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I am pleased to accept this prize .
First of all , I would like to travel in July . At present , I am doing an art course at college .
I have some trouble with my back . Therefore I ca n't sleep in a sleeping bag on the ground .
Furthermore , I would love to do basketball and painting activities while I am at the camp .
I am a member of the college basketball team , which became the best basketball team of last year .
Secondly , I want to do painting , which I am really interested in as a student at art college .
Lastly , I would like to learn what kinds of clothes I have to bring with me and how much money ( American currency - dollars ) I 'll need to have while I 'm there .
I would like to thank you for your letter , which I received yesterday , and I wanted to reply as soon as possible .
I know you want to hear about what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
My friends and I were taken backstage where we met the members of West Life , Elton John and Robie Williams .
I even got a bunch of flowers from them with a " thank you " letter .
What we all did was make many cups of coffee and help to find their missing socks or any other clothing .
What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebrities .
I particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano , clarinet , drums , violin etc .
Which was really great , and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want .
Firstly I was very disappointed to find out that unheard - of actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected .
I 'm very sorry to let you know that not only was the show really boring , but it also started 45 minutes late -
this should n't happen !
In addition to this , I listened to bad singers and noticed a numertable lack of variety in the dancing .
I know this is not your fault , but it was very annoying .
This show might be the newest in London , but is it at all the best .
Finally I do think it would be fair to give the audience their money back - so I am asking you for a complete refund ( cash ) of the ticket price .
We all know that she is n't good at keeping her mouth shut at all , but it should have been better this time .
Their parents were so happy that they decided to give him a fantastic present : the brand new car he had always dreamed of .
This should have been a big surprise for him : the car was bought and everything was prepared in a very hush - hush atmosphere .
Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car , but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend : " It will be delivered on Thursday !
Can you imagine Philip 's face when he sees his favourite car out there ? "
The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual level of activity all over the house .
" Are you looking for these ? " asked Philip , showing the keys to the car .
And disappeared , heading for the rear door .
Dear Helen ,
I 've been thrilled ever since I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently .
In response to the letter , I am sending mine to state the choices that I have made concerning the date of the trip , the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen , along with some questions .
Firstly , I wish to travel in July as I already have plans for June , which are to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacation commences .
Secondly , regarding the question of lodging , I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much .
However , as this will be my first time surfing , I am willing to take classes for beginners .
Lastly , I 've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would like to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of the amount of money I will have to spend in the camp .
I am looking forward to being received at camp California .
I was glad to receive a letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert , I started writing as soon as I could .
I think it 's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer !
I had so much fun helping my friends ' band putting on their concert .
I 'm not sure what part you 're interested in , but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best , and I suggest that you try doing it too .
I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that took place yesterday evening .
None of the conditions were fulfilled : firstly , Danny Brook , who was going to perform in the show , was changed for another actor .
Furthermore , the show started at 20:15 while the advertisement said that it was going to begin at 19:30 .
Furthermore , there were n't any discounts on the price of the tickets .
I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all the promises that were made in the advertisement .
Of course , what was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening , and I would be very grateful if you could refund me the price of my ticket .
I imagine they will be very different .
Scientists will invent new materials that will keep the body 's temperature in a suitable range .
In that way people wo n't feel cold or hot , they will always be at the same temperature .
In addition these new materials will weigh hardly anything .
As well as that , people wo n't be as worried about fashion as nowadays , however , it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport and everything you have to do .
For that reason clothes will be simpler and more practical .
Besides , everybody will be able to afford to buy them then . That 's because the price of this sort of material will be very affordable .
Of course , the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the environment because people will be more aware of the necessity of taking care of the world we live in .
I write this letter because I think there were too many problems concerning your musical show : " Over the rainbow " .
First , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but she must have been replaced since the actor was different .
I also want to put the emphasis on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm .
It was really a shame !
In fact , if I had known , I would have probably stayed at home .
We see on the advertisement that discounts are available .
And , we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant because it was closed .
Indeed , there was a little note on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness .
Consequently I ask you for some money back , seeing that I think : it 's not worth the bother to lose money for such a show . ,
I think that modern technology changes my daily life .
For example , if I want to buy something , I can go on my computer and buy it .
On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we 've got more and more opportunities to enjoy ourselves since it invents a lot of products .
But on the other hand , technology 's products are sometimes expensive and I ca n't afford them .
In fact , I like technology but sometimes I wish it had never existed since there are too many things on the market .
Indeed , when you want to buy a television , for example , there are a lot of different makes .
And it 's all the more tiring since you often wait for two weeks before getting it .
I 'm bound to feel tense .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about some aspects of the musical show " Over the rainbow " , which was played in your theatre .
The first problem we had was that the discounts announced in the advertisement were not available and we had to pay the full price .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking for my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
Yours sincerely
Fashion news is followed by lots of people .
People have always looked for the most comfortable clothes for their daily lives .
I think that this tendency will not change but what will change is life .
We tend to be a society that wants more free time so people will need more comfortable clothes to enjoy it .
Scientists are looking for new materials that will make our clothes more comfortable and stronger .
Clothes will have a strong relation to the new technologies , and modern devices will be included in our everyday clothes .
Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected to technology and society .
Dear Mrs Clark ,
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisement , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and make some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take into consideration .
The International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea .
I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent , considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money .
In your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world , unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented .
I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the festival if it is possible .
It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kinds of music and to discover different cultures .
Hoping that I have not offended you in any way and that you might take into consideration my suggestions , I wish you all the best for next year 's festival organisation .
Yours sincerely
The night he came into this world was one of grater for the inhabitants of the country and also of the town where he was born , it was an ordinary night .
The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars lit up all the land .
Only the ones who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king had been born .
When the three men saw him , they fell on their knees to worship him .
The mother was proud because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins .
This little man from Israel died as the hero of all times .
His message is still as impacting today and will always be , even if this story happened a long time ago .
To begin with , according to your advertisement , discount tickets are available .
So I could not get a good seat .
To make matters worse , although Danny Brook should have starred there was a different actor .
I was really looking forward to seeing his performance , but on starting the show , I found it disappointing .
Finally , I would like to ask you to give me some money back .
I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply by return of post .
In my opinion , modern technology has changed my daily life significantly .
When I meet my friends somewhere but can not arrive there on time , I can tell them about it using the phone .
On the other hand , when I do not want anybody to disturb me , the phone annoys me .
With the Internet and E - mail , I can get lots of information from everywhere , and I can get in touch with my friends who live abroad .
Since I bought a computer , I have been checking for E - mails from my friend almost every day .
Finding them , I feel happy even if there is only one .
On balance then , I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it advances too rapidly for me to catch up .
Last week , I was on holiday in London , and having read the advertisement for your musical show , I had planned ( as it said ) " a perfect evening out " .
But as it turned out , it really was n't a pleasant evening , and I did n't enjoy myself .
On top of this , the advertisement was n't right at all , or I must have been to the wrong show !
That 's nearly an hour late !
The tickets were rather expensive , and the discounts mentioned in the advertisement were n't at all available at the theatre .
I was a little hungry after the show , but then again , I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information given .
Pat was my friend , I trusted her and we got on very well until she repeated to everyone the secret I had told her .
There was only one thing I did n't like about her : she would do anything to have friends , even betray me .
He 's travelling around the world , " I would say , and everyone would admire him .
But I knew Pat knew , and because of her , so did everyone else : he was in prison because he had killed a man .
I know , now , why I wanted to hide the truth .
I 'm very happy to have won your competition .
I 've never been to the U.S.A so I 'm very excited to visit Camp California .
I can come only in July because I have to work the other months of summer .
Regarding accommodation I 'd prefer to sleep in a tent because I like being outside and hearing the noises of the sea .
My two preferred activities are climbing and surfing .
I used to climb and I want to try it again because climbing is a good way to keep fit . I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing make similar sensations , but I have never tried it .
I have one question to ask you . I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take him with me .
He does n't like to stay at home alone .
I propose that we should film five subjects :
a maths lesson , an English lesson , a swimming lesson , the break and the staff room .
- In the maths lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher teaches his students .
We could film the classroom too .
- In the swimming pool we could be in the water and doing a party of water - polo and then Allan could done acrobatics stands , because he enters competitions .
- We could show the activities of the students during the break . For example , students who play football or volleyball .
We could ask some students about the school .
We could find out what this room is like and what the teachers do in this mysterious room .
At the end we could have a comment from each student in our class .
I am really pleased that I have won first prize in your competition at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I think it is more interesting than a log cabin .
I can be closer to nature and I have never used tents before .
When I was a child , I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend , having a chat , making a barbecue , playing games .
My parents were very proud of me .
Could I ask you some questions ? I would like to know what kind of clothes I should bring to the camp .
How much money should I bring and can I use my credit card at the camp ?
I 'm sorry that I 've taken such a long time to reply to your letter because I 'm really busy and I have to study harder .
Last month , I got a part - time job .
Before the concert I was really excited . I could n't sleep well and I did n't know what I had to do at the concert .
There were lots of singers and a band .
Of course , there were lots of spectaculars .
I was really excited .
My hands were trembling but I did it very well .
After that , I went back stage .
I 'm sorry that I did n't ask if I could take any pictures of them for you .
I had to take care of them and did everything they wanted .
For instance , taking them to the toilet , making coffee for them , helping them find their stuff .
I learnt lots of thing there that I could n't learn from school .
I met lots of people with different jobs .
I had a great time .
I 'd like to say something that I felt during the festival , and give my opinions that would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival .
First of all , I congratulate you for organizing such an exciting festival .
It was a great idea , and I enjoyed myself at this festival very much .
By the way , according to the advertisement , lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival , but I was able to meet them from only six countries .
And another thing is that some concert halls were too small , so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded , and during the concerts people felt suffocated .
I hope you 'll get much bigger concert halls next year .
On the other hand , the plays and films were excellent .
I expect that much more varied kinds of plays and films will be on next year .
Finally , I 'd like to mention the reasonably - priced weekend ticket .
It was brillient , because if I had to pay for all things individually I would n't have attended it , because it was very expensive for me .
Thank you very much for that .
A long time ago , there were two brothers , whose parents were dead .
By the way , the elder brother , Nolbu was a very greedy man .
He did n't want to share the money with his brother , Hungbu , so he took all of the money , and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything .
Hungbu had nothing but his family of twelve .
But , even if he was very poor , he was very good and had a lot of affection for the people who were much poorer than his family , so he looked after them .
One cold day , Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing , so the bird could n't fly to the warmer country during the winter .
He cured the bird with love , and the bird was able to fly .
The following year , when the bird returned to his house , he gave him a message .
It was a kind of map that showed the location of a lot of money which robbers hid .
People believe that the bird was sent from heaven .
So in order to keep myself occupied for a while , I went to the restaurant but it was n't open .
The show itself was quite disappointing .
Anyway , after watching the musical , I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with the hope that it might be open , but still , nobody was in .
He said it was because the manager of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day .
So I am going to ask for a refund ... I hope this is n't offending you too much ...
When it comes down to colour , I think it 'll be much brighter and maybe glittery .
Like shiny and plastic kind . Maybe silver and gold , glittery red , purple and blue .
Colours to match the clothes .
I think I 'll be fine in the clothes we have now ... I mean , I wo n't get sick of them !
First of all , I would like to thank you for doing such a good job organising the competition which I luckily won . I have been really very impressed .
Unfortunately I received your letter two weeks late so I can travel only between the 5th and the 20th July .
In fact I will finish my university exams only on the first of July and after the 20th it is impossible because I am going to do four weeks ' voluntary work in India for UNICEF .
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollen .
So a stay in a log cabin will probably save me a lot of problems .
Choosing two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing , a sport in which I have many years of experience , and surfing , despite not really having any experience .
Unfortunately I have never been to the US so I do n't have any idea about how much money I will probably need or about what kind of clothes I have to take with me .
Thank you very much for your attention on my behalf
Yours sincerely
If you ask twenty women what their favourite hobbies are probably most of them will answer " shopping " .
Why have so many people been infected by this " psychological virus " ?
We are always trying to have more things , which lead us to neglect our family , our future , and other things which are probably more important than a new perfume .
More and more people , everywhere , are becoming shopping addicts .
Maybe you think I am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous .
Certainly only the fact of having something can help people to be more sure of themselves .
In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein product to a certain kind of person you are cool , but is it really so important ?
Probably when Oscar Wilde said : " Superficiality is the supreme vice " he was right .
Dear Mr. Smith ,
I am writing this letter to let you know about the bad points of the theatre .
It was written in the newspaper that Danny Brock performed in the play .
If there had been a problem , we should have been told .
I wanted to see him but I could n't see him .
But in the newspaper there was said to be a discount . I paid Â£ 20 to the cashier .
Because I did n't enjoy at the theatre .
I hope you will not continue like this .
But if they were n't made , we would have to walk or go by horse or donkey .
With the help of technology , we do our work in less time .
For example , in the past , people used horses to go to another place .
And their life passed in the ways .
But now we use planes to go to far away places .
And computers are the most important product of technology .
In the world , people spend the whole day playing with computers .
They use computers for their work .
They communicate with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers .
They write their secret notes on computers .
But in the past people had to use lots of notebooks and they also had to find places to hide them .
But it also has bad points .
For example , wars .
Using technology , scientists make lots of powerful guns .
It is bad for world peace .
I think we should use technology for peace and use it for our benefit .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the show you put on two weeks ago at your theatre .
As I was spending a weekend in London . I took the opportunity to see the performance of one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook .
Unfortunately as soon as I got to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore .
Besides , since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we had n't had any dinner , as we had been thinking of having it at your restaurant .
You can not imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast - food restaurant .
In conclusion , I would like to have the two tickets refunded , considering also that there were no discounts available , in contrast to what was stated in the advertisement .
In fact this was the main reason for Mr White 's resignation and suicide .
Pat was not a very clever teenager and while she was attending Secondary School she had many problems with Chemistry .
I could actually say that if it had n't been for Mr. White she would never have passed her exam to enter University .
Mr White came to our school when he was 40 years old but still good - looking and all my female school - mates fell suddenly in love with him ; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girl felt herself loved by him : Pat certainly was one of them .
Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her classmates and she ran away as fast as she could .
She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any hesitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen .
The next day Mr White was charged with abuse and obliged to resign .
The trial was long and received wide coverage from the media .
We live in a small and old - fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster : losing his job was hard for him , but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him ; so , on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died , terrified by the darkness which was nearing .
