In addition to this , after the show , we looked for the theatre restaurant which has been closed for repairing since one month ago .
In conclusion , last night definitely was the worst experience about entertainment I 've ever had in my life and that 's why I ask you my money back as a compensation .
faithfuly ,
Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship and the ways to comunicate to other people as well as our life expectancy .
With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access Internet to comunicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from ourselves .
Despite of the distances , we can keep our friendship closely and with a cheaply way .
Besides of this , the information goes faster than it used to know and it 's avaiable in the same time to every part of the world .
On the one hand , our time is taken to learn how to deal with the new technologies .
On the other hand , we can feel more comfortable with them providing us support to our hard tasks and letting us free to apply our attention and efforts to more important things .
For instance , we can research new manners of improving our quality of life .
In conclusion , we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware about how they are introduced in our lives to avoid the dangerous side of the TECHNOLOGY .
Dear sir ,
I 'm writing to you , to complain about the musical show " OVER THE RAINBOW " , that I came to see during my holiday in London , at your theatre .
First of all in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part at the show .
But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking part .
And the worst was that he was n't so good in his role !
Another thing was that the show I went to was starting at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 !
The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they were waiting for too long , And I absolutely agree with them .
Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available , but they were n't , And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show , to eat some thing or to have a drink .
But when I went there , it was closed . I do n't know why and I 'd like you to tell me , the reason .
Well it was n't and I ask for my money back .
I 'd like you to return them to me .
I 'll wait to hear from you soon ...
So , the next day Pat went and told to his sister Sally that her friends were organising a suprise party for her birthday .
When Sally heared that , was very suprised and very excited .
But because she did n't want to disappoint her friends , she was acting as she did n't know anything .
She let them to organise it !
But although she was acting like this she was very ungry with her brother Pat , because he did n't keep the secret .
All her friends were going to meet there , while she was at her swimming lesson .
When that day arrived they all went there as they planned .
When the clock showed 8:00 they hide themselves under the tables and the furnitures .
After a while the bell rang .
Suddenly they all shouted " suprise ! " .
Sally although she knew it , she seemed very suprised !
So her friends did n't understand that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the suprise party had succeed !
It was an unforgetable night ! ! !
I am writing to complaine about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting " Over the Rainbow " .
Then , they were not any discounts available for the tickets as it was written on the advertisement .
On top of everything Danny Brook , the star of the night , was absent and his role was performed by a different actor .
I would like to ask for some refund because the whole evening was very disappointing and it did not worth the money given
As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century , the style of dressing changes rootly through the years .
So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be like 100 years from now
If humans turn to be more free from social rules , I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited .
Everybody will wear anything he / she likes , choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange .
On the other hand , if human society turns to be stricher and more limited , there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing , formed by the needs of the society .
All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around .
Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too .
This is how I think fashion of the future will be like .
The most exciting about this is that people wo n't think that their clothes are strange as we do n't think about ours .
A few weeks ago , I went to London , and I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show , called " Over the Rainbow . "
I 'm very sory to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening .
First , I got there at 7:00 pm , because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm , and I need some time to by the tickets , I by two tickets of £ 20 and when I ask for a discount , they did n't give it to me , then I keep waiting for the show to start untill 8:15 pm .
Then when the show finally started I got very disappointed because , I really wanted to see Danny Brook , but instead of him there was any other actor .
Lately when the show finished , I planed to go to the restorant and get some food , but I was close , because it was being repaired .
I will be very thankfull if your could return me half or some of my money , or even to make the corresponding discount .
Your faithfully
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , every time I tell something to her , finally everyone knew about it .
But this time it was something more important that any other time .
I was in love with a friend 's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair , but when I made the big mistake of telling me little and terrible secret to Pat , everithing started going wrong , Katrin my friend , and the one I was being bad with , was very upset with me , and she was right , but I really do n't know what to do , I was in love with Brett , but I love my friend too .
So I decide to talk to Brett .
We both decided to finish with all this stupid affair .
It was difficult , but I was the best for everyone .
Then I decide to talk to Katrin , I was very sory of all I have do , so I apologize with her and promise her that this will never would happen again .
Now I 'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the hole world .
I 'm writing to complain about the performance , Over The Rainbow at The Circle Theatre on the 14th of June .
It is always a great opportunity to enjoy a musical when you go on your holiday to London .
London is one of Europe 's biggest centre and you can always get the best in show business .
Rescently I decided to watch Over The Rainbow , a very famous and wellknown show .
Firstly , the night performance was 45 minutes late and there were no discounts available as the advertisement told .
Furthermore , I was shooked when one of the main persons entered the stage .
He was n't Danny Brook , one of the resons for my choice .
Finally , the Theatre Restaurant was under reparation so we had to find another one for the evening supper .
This was n't " my perfect evening out " , as said , and I 'll make a claim for half the money back .
I 'm looking forward to receiving you reply as soon as possibly .
How has modern technology changed my daily life .
A century ago , when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plouge behind them , we 've got the word " time " .
Why not talk about the social life just sitting around a table without no rush .
In modern days we have to wear a mobile phone .
I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner , I could see those busy people always on their way .
I heard the different phone signals , and what a miracle you can change them on the train when you are restless .
A new word has appeared in those days , a technical proof of this is the computer . I can send and save information and the possibilities are uncountless .
In nearly every home you can find it and the users now and in the future are the new generation .
I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role , exspecially today when fuel is so expensive .
Watch out highly advanced technologies are appropriate and helpful for me and others if we only remember the importance of time to be together .
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement of The Circle theater said about the musical show called '
First of all , the most annoying thing for me was the absence of Danny Brook because in my country I do n't have the chance to enjoy his excellent performance .
Another actor standed for him , without any advice .
Another thing was the confirmed hour of the show which it started forty - five minutes later without any factual reason .
In addition to all this , there was no discount in the price of the tickets , for students either , contrary to what I was told by phone when I asked for more information .
Moreover , as I had read the advertisement carefully , I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theater 's restaurant .
But for our surprise , it was out of order .
At the end of all these circumstances we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint .
So , due to the things I have mentioned , I think I shoul be given some money back .
I look forward to recieving information from you .
When this technological aspect changes so quickly , I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields .
I would say that the worst thing of this development for me is that more and more I experience stress in almost every aspect of my life .
There is no enough time to do a lot of things ; and if I want to do them , I realize that my life passes devoted in my duties without time to pleasures .
Apart from this , another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities , being able to breath fresh air several days a month when we go to the country .
In addition to this , there is less comunication between members of my family , because when we arrive at home after an exhausted day racing with the time , the only thing we want to do is lying in the sofa while watching television .
Apart from this , computer 's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to , while five years ago when I did not have a computer , I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact with people .
On the other hand and as a conclusion , I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with differents functions .
I am writing in order to complain about the Musical Show , OVER THE RAIN , I went to see to the theatre .
In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook , and to my surprise it was a different actor , and it realy disapoint me .
Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15 , more than half an hour later .
I cuold read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there were nt .
And the restorant of the theatre was being pait , so I could not go as you said in the advertisment .
As you may undertand it was not a perfect night and I am not pleased with the show on eaven with your services .
That is why I am going to ask you my money back .
I am look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible .
Tecnology , are we prepeared for those advances ?
It change every days and I do not know if we will be able to understand it .
Tecnology improves our lives , we have tecnology for cook , for work , for study , well hardly for everything .
Mostly all of us , today know what is internet about , but one or two year ago we did not .
And when we understand internet , we thought that meeting people from other countrys and could " chat " with them , was the top of the tecnology .
But now we can eaven watch his face , Internet is amaizing .
and now of courese there will someone trying to improve it .
Tecnology change our daily life , it makes our life easily to live and of courese more confortable like with computers , televitions , radios etcetera and some times more secure like in medicine .
Definitly we should try to understand tecnology , if we know how to use it , tecnology will improve our way of life .
Thank you for organising the school trip in London .
According to the advertisement I have seen , it is supposed to show the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with strongest motivation .
Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show , we will be able to go shopping at a free time on 15th March .
First of all , they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrity .
Therefore , they should deserve to lead a normal life as we do .
Secondly , noone has the right to look at anyone 's private life even if they are journalists .
Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of the human rights .
However , I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right of privacy .
To sum up , famous people are the same as we are , and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to break into their privacy .
I am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has presented recently , and , I want you to know , it has really disappointed me .
To begin with , the actor the advertisement showed did not come , which I found it in very bad taste , disappointing .
Moreover , the show started at a quarter past eight , forty - five minutes later than it might have been .
I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because , as you may know , there were not discounts available .
It is for this reason , I think you should return me some money back .
To sum up , I would like to make my point about what happened in the restaurant after that .
I think you would have to take it into consideration to avoid it happens again .
If I had know it before , I would have never told her , because then , that was really important for me , but , anyway , presently , it does n't really matter me .
By the time , Pat and me had a close relationship .
I explained her everything it happened to me and vice versa .
We had many points in common and we knew each other as if we were sisters .
However , one day our friendship was broken down .
I told her I was falling in love with my best friend and she decided to explain it everybody in our group , despite knowing that must be a secret .
When I met Caballos , my best friend , I felt embarassd and disappointed and I could n't say anything .
Now I wish all of this had never happened , while I try to forget it laughing with Caballos and Pat .
I was very glad to receive this great notice .
I entered in this competition because I have always wanted to do these kind of things .
In your letter you asked me when I would rather travel , I will be able only on July because I have to work and I can take some days off on this month .
If it is no problem I would rather stay in a lab cabin because I do not like much sleeping on the floor , but if you can not put me there I will be fine anywhere .
About the I have to choose I would like to tell you something .
I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to practice new ones , if it is possible .
I am keen on water and risk sports so I would choose climbing and surfing , I think it would be great if I learn them while I am there .
Finally , I would like to ask you if there is any place where I can buy some souvenirs , so to take some money with me and I would be very grateful if you could send me a list of clothes .
It is like if they lose their concience while they are shopping .
You can do shopping alone , with friends or with your kids , but the best thing of it is that you feel that you have all the power while you are buying things .
May be it is not for you , may be it is a present , but buying things at least for me it is the best .
When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place , all trying to find the best prices and not carying about anybody , this could get crazy to anyone .
The long queues , close places , hight prices , sales , all these things conbined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it .
But my advise for people , who like it so much that can not help doing it , is to try shopping in the afternoon , at this hour no - one do shopping and if there are some shops that are closed you can always go to a shopping mall .
Taking a photography during the holiday is very good memory for me , and I can share my adventures to my friends .
So while I am at the Camp I like to take many photographies and climb a mountain .
Fresh - air , flowers and meeting some interesting people while you are climbing you have .
Finally , thanks for giving this opportunity to me I look forward to hearing from you .
Shopping sounds very enjobleable and fantastic for women . You can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected .
Some people enjoy window shopping , but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes .
Nowadays in a family shopping is n't women 's job .
In other hand , after shopping you 'll get tired and maybe you ca n't afford your credit card .
For instance , you want to buy everything which you saw , and after that , you do n't know how much you have spent .
If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things .
It will be very awful .
However , shopping has pros and cons , it depends on personal thinking .
I enjoy shopping very much , it can let me know what 's going on in the world .
But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping , you wo n't feel so tired .
Thank you very much for your letter with reference to the competition .
Here are the information you required .
With contrast to this , I can swim when I was six .
Furthermore , I once have been trained in a swimming centre , so I am quite confident with it .
Lastly , could you please tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should prepare and do I have to buy insurance myself ?
The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video from my school .
In my opinion , maths , politics , chinese , English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones .
They are also the lessons which English and other foreigners are particularlly curious in .
As far as I know , English people are really surprised about Chinese students ' advanced level in Maths , as well as the knowledge in politics .
This is a good oppertunate to see how they learn in class .
As it is expected , painting lesson is an amazing one . You can find students use traditional chinese ink to draw and write .
In spite of lessons , there are all kind of activities such as sports meeting , racing competition , and countryside activities .
In conclusion , besides all mentioned , I highly recommond you video students ' daily life and interview them .
That will make it defenitely a successful video .
In fact it was quite different from the one I had expected to see .
First of all , Danny Brook was n't the leading actor , though his name was printed on the brochure .
Considering that I had to buy a full - price ticket ( even if I had read on the brochure that discounts would be available ) , I think you can understand my anger .
New technologies have affected people 's way of living for ages , by offering them better tools to survive
Neither do I. In particular I 'd like to talk about Internet .
I think that Internet has changed my daily life most of all .
In fact , now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries , for exemple in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing .
Therefore I regard Internet as a quite powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relations among people .
I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I 'm really astounded by its way of changing my daily life .
I am really glad for reciving the first priec in your competition , I will be very plesant joining the holliday .
According to your first question , I would like to travel only at July because it is my school holliday so I would not miss any class .
I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as closest as possible to nature , it makes me feel better .
As a regard for activities I would choose singing and surfing , surfing because it is my favourit sport , I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good on it , and singing because I really love it , I am not as good on singing as I am on surfing but I like doing it .
I would like to ask about somethings which might be necessary for me to take with , like what kind of clothes should I take , should I take my own surf board , and what about money , should I bring some with me ?
I am looking forward to hear from you .
As you know , I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand for the band called RAMONES .
It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well , those guys really know how to play rock .
I had only to stay behind the drummer suppling them with water whenever they wanted .
When the band had just started to play , lots of girls started to jump the faints getting very close to them , some of the girls started to take their clothes of , which was the best part for me , but some of securities went there and took them away .
Afterwards , the Ramones had a short break and when they went back from their break they 've just went of .
I had a really nice time with them even tought I would've prefered to stay at the front with the others people ,
but anyway it was a great experience for me , I holp to be able to help them next year .
I holp you 've enjoed my experience , and I hope to hear from you soon .
I received your letter and would be glad to travel two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July for in June I will be in Austria with a friend and in August I have rented an appartment with my family .
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary material for camping .
While I am at the Camp I would like to play tennis and do photography .
I play very well tennis since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice in photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it .
Will you give clothes for activities ?
Faithfully Yours ,
You can fall on a very disagreable sellor and if you find what you wanted , you will not want to pay him or her for it .
Sometimes the seller might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another sellor .
Two sellers are talking and although they saw you enter , they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them .
Then , one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other sellor .
There is nothing more disagreable than that .
Also , when you find a nice sellor and he shows you lots of objects , when you do n't find what you want , you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her lose his or her time so you feel obliged to buy something .
All this to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not .
Further to the umpleasent fact that took place last week I am in my right of complaining about the musical show I saw when I was in London .
First of all , when we arrived we went to pay and we gave a discount ticket .
It was not available but the worst thing was that nobody explained us the reason .
The show had to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15 , then I felt dissappointed because the main actor had been changed .
It had not been such a terrible thing if the new actor would have acted as well as the other one .
If it does not seem enough , after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre 's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday .
After explaining you my complains I hope you to send me some money back .
It was our last school year , so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate we had finally finished it .
We knew that our parents would n't let us to travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid they could realize what happened .
Kim , Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so , did I. We were excited and we started to organized everything .
We booked some rooms in a hotel , next to the beach and we bought all the useful things we were going to need .
It seemed the perfect holiday but it was n't .
Pat was in love with my eldest brother whose name is Jon ( I have never got on well with him ) .
Pour Pat , she did n't know my brother , she did n't know how he was .
We lost our holidays .
I feel very happy a I answer immidiatly to your letter .
I would like to travel only in July , because I will have holiday that time .
I 'm always having holidays in July it is my favorite time for holidays .
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents , because I use to go tents holidays , I like it .
From activities which you offer to me I choose swimming and tennis .
I am very good in swimming .
I do this sport since I was child and I really enjoy it .
I 'm not so good in tennis but I would like to play it for practise .
Also I find that it sport is very usefull for my health and does me feel better .
It is all about me .
At first , which kind of clothes I need take with me , because I do n't know anything about the weather in California , and at tend how much money I will need .
Some people likes to do shopping .
I never liked shopping .
It always was trouble for me .
I do n't like to have many things in my house , I do n't like to have many clothes and shoes , and I do n't know what else .
Just nesseccary .
I think the people who are enjoying shopping they are greede for materialistic things and they havn't interests for spirit ( ? ) , intelect life .
They are loosing time of their life for nothing .
In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things like sport , reading , chating about ideas which make our lives better .
We must do something for help other people to feel better and usefull .
Dear Madam Ryan ,
I can go to the Camp California only in July , because I have school in June and I must work in my father 's bookshop in August .
At the Camp I want to live in a log cabin .
I do not like the tents ; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins .
For the two activities I can choose , I would like to play tennis : I have some experience in this sport , because I played tennis during seven years and it is still my favourite activity .
I would like to know what sort of clothes I have to take ( if it is going to rainy or to be sunny ) and how much money I must have with me .
Could you tell me what sort of material I will have to bring to do the activities ?
Do you know last week I have been to a pop concert to help my uncle , who is the director of the stadium of Lugano .
It was very interresting , because I did different things .
I cooked a meal for the artists , I spoke with the manager of Bruce Springsteen and I helped a technician to install his material : the lights .
I was very excited , because this is my favourite group : I 'm always hearing their songs .
I took some photographies and I 'll show them to you when you come next week
I had a talk with Santana , the best guitarist in the world , too .
I would like playing guitar like him .
The next concert is on 19th June and I will be here .
Dear director of the Circle Theater !
On Friday we , my friend and I visited your Theater to see ' Over the rainbow ' .
It should has been my best evening that week , unfortunatly it was n't .
The first thing that happen was that the show did n't start on time .
Instead of 730 am as your advertisment said , it started 815 am .
When the show started Danny Brook was not acting , witch was a great dissapointment for us both .
We are both big faan of him
When the show was finished we went to the resturant to have something to eat .
But then it was cloesed because of reparations .
Due to all this troubel I think we should have our money back .
We both have £ 15 tickets .
And to an other time , make soure that your advertisment is correkt !
When were nine years old and were in thired grade we had a ' House ' where we used to play all afternones .
In fact it was n't a realy house , it was some stones between the trees in the littel forest neear our house .
It was a secret place and we had promissed each other not to tell anybody about it .
Useally we were cooking flower - soup , and talking secrets .
One day when I were there alone , I heard some other kids aproting , I sat down behind one of the stones so they shoulden't see me .
One minute later , Pat and half our classe stod in ' the House ' looking and laufing at me and my flower soup .
Maby she did it to get friends .
But in fact that day she had loosed my friendship .
I 've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical , starting from the advertisement .
An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing .
Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor , totally stranger to me .
Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30 , but the theatre started at 20:15 .
I do n't want to be rude , but this is not proffessional at all .
Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock .
And I am asking you : Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience ?
I am closing this letter by saying you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back , please
Regards
How has modern technology changed your daily life .
We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods .
As a result of all these advanced technological methods , I became one of the daily users of modern technology .
Of course this sometimes is an advantage , when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier , but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends .
The computer has become my second nature .
And not only the computer .
Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course .
One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I can not live without my mobile phone .
In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things , some of them are good and some others are not so good .
It 's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way , and make our lives easier .
The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology is a benefit for you .
If you do n't is going to destroy you .
I am writing you to show my disagree about the musical show ' Over the rainbow .
First , I am very dissapointed with the starring .
That is why , it finished later and I arrived late to a basketball match .
Another thing is that there were not any discounts in the entrance fee .
Finally , the theatre restaurant was closed because it was sunday .
It is closed all sundays , you have to say it .
That is why I will be pleased if you give my money back .
I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed , before we were on holidays , they will cancelled the trip to Africa .
But , I need to say it to someone , so I told it to Pat .
The next day , all the class knew it .
I was n't too worried because if someones is going to see my parents , I would tell them before not talk about the exams .
But , when my mother was talking with Pat 's mother and she mentioned it , my mother cancelled the trip to Africa .
It was n't Pat fault , it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and also , I knew that Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Not only were there Jazz and Rock but there were clasics as well .
There were wonderful plays and films which I hope that there would have been more .
All the other shows such as dance shows , art exhibition and talks by writers were very amusing .
I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably - priced for all events .
I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days in the Arts Festival at the end .
He came and said to the widower that he was to bring him on his back .
The widow who was afaid told the man of the gold .
He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake into half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle .
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO EXPLAIN MY DESAGREABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE THE LAST SATURDAY , IN YOUR SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
FIRST OF ALL , I WANT YOU KNOW THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND 'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY DURING ONE MONTH .
MY INTENTION WAS TO SPEND AN SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM . AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL ! ! !
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY .
BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE , BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE .
BUT WHAT CANNOT I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT , MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK 'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED .
IT ISN'T ALL .
WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED , WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER , AS YOU PUBLISHED ON THE PROGRAMM , BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS ! ! !
NOBODY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES , AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY .
I FEEL YOU LIE ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS .
I WAIT YOUR ANSWER , AND OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE .
Your 's faithfully ,
He enjoyed himself reading , playing piano at home .
Despite his way of live , his best friend was Anna , the most popular girl in the school .
She explained everything what happened in her live to Pat .
When Pat was 16 , he decided to change his way of live , spending more time with friends , but what he could do to have some friends ?
Definately the worse .
He started to " sell " the secrets of Anna to all the boys of the school who were interested in her .
All the boys of the class went to Pat to know what Anna was doing in every moment , and Pat was becoming ' friend ' of all the boys .
Everyone , less Anna .
She did n't tell him anything more , and Pat did n't have any secret to sell to his " new friends " .
At least , Pat did n't have any friend , because he did n't have anything to sell about Anna .
Is it moral , to get some friends destroying and hurting another people ? I think NO !
Dear Sir / Madam .
And I visited your theatre to see a musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
And I 'll try to explain why .
First of all , there were the different actors in a show , but you did n't say anything about it before the show .
It started at 20:15 , but it was said that it starts at 19:30 .
As a result I missed my train .
There were no ay discount at all .
But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with the discount .
And the last disappointment was your restaurant after the show .
It was closed because of the lack of stuth
So as a conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully .
With the best wishes
And of course the technology is also changing .
Not so long ago we had to do many things by our hand , but now there re a lot of machines to do the same .
Now we have free time to do anything else , while machine is doing our work .
It 's connected with our house , our workplace and e.t.c .
For example , earlier I used to wash my clothes by hand , but now I have the last version of wash machine and now there are no any reasons to do it by hand .
Earlier it took me 3 hours , but now it is my free time and I can go for a walk with my friends .
Another example is that earlier we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy .
And it takes bout 1 minute to make a copy but not 1 hour .
So , I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the really important for our life things .
It is very fantastic especially the programme on 13th March that we are having a river trip to Greenwich .
The purpose that I am writing due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
It is worth visiting exhibition and we would like to go there .
The show is established on Tuesday March 14th at Central Exhibition Hall London from 10.00 to 19.00 .
In the hall , there are four important themes ; latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up , and hairstyles .
This is great opportunity for the student to learn the changing in fashion and leisure and it is free .
We agreed all that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful .
On Tuesday morning , we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting Science Museum and we will go there tomorrow morning .
Visiting National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on Tuesday morning .
That all I would like to recommend you .
It would be greatful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us about your decision as soon as possible .
The discussion about whether or not the famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is the controversial one .
There are people from both side of agrument who have strong feelings .
There is evidence that these people 's life should be advertised by the media .
Obviously , they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened to them .
In addition , their life may be the good example for other people to follow .
Sometime , many people do n't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate .
However , there is other disadvantages that we should consider .
Firstly , the famous people would like to do anything they want without being concentrated by media .
I think it is annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance would be known by the public .
Eventhough , the famous people can be the good example , they should be the bad habit for public .
A lot of people try to be like people who they admire , For example , buying the clothes that famous people wear .
The reason that they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life .
To Prevent many people from copying too much we should n't inform all aspects of life of famous people .
I agree that the famous people life should be in private .
It is the benefit for themselves and the public .
Dear Sir or Madame ,
So I can go to the camp in the middle of the July .
I 've had unpleasant experience from my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent .
In addition as I haven't stayed in a cabin , I look forward to staying in a cabin .
Most of all , I 'm so happy that I could choose some activities . I 'd like to practice golf and tennis .
Both of them are my favorite sports and I 'm quite good .
Which kind of clothes I have to bring and how much money I will need ?
I 'll be grateful if you could send me further information .
Yours Sincerely
But nowadays I found shopping is not always enjoyable .
I ca n't make enough money for my living expense .
I have to control my expenses on the budget .
Anyway I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets .
I refer to your letter in which you informed me that I have won the first prise in the competition .
You asked me for some further information and hear are my " desirs " :
Further I would prefer to live in a tent at the Camp , because I am already used to that , because I often spent my holidays in tents .
I would like to do painting , because one of my greatest hobbies is silk - painting and so I think I can improve my abilities .
The second activity , which I choose is playing basketball , because I love this wonderful sport .
I am in our school - basketball - team .
I hope that you are now well informed and I would like to ask you which clothes and how much money I should bring with me .
Thank you very much , I look forward to hearing from you .
Your sincerely
My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears .
I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets .
Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both !
I had to tell one of them , that she had to leave .
Such a poor girl .
At this moment I did n't like my position .
My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect " dangerous " items , I saw really funny things like teeth - bruches in the bags .
Summing up I can say that it was a fantastic day , because Britney sang so beautiful and the performance was also super .
I hope you can imagine how a wonderful day it was for me .
I am writing , on the name of all my English class , to thank you for the opportunity you give us to spend three days in London , but also to suggest some modifications in the programme .
The programme you has already organised is very interesting , especially because it provides a good combination between cultural visits and more relaxed activities .
But , in another hand , we have seen an advertisement for the " London Fashion and Leisure Show " , which includes a range of different stands .
The only day we can attend to this show is the Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall .
We are really interested in visiting this unhabitual show and the main advantage is that the entry is free for students .
In conclusion , I suggest that we go directly after the Science Museum to the show .
We all agree that we have enough time in Wednesday for shopping .
I hope that you will agree with this suggestion .
Yours faithfully
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing them all the time
Famous people have always been the center of interest for number of people .
Their wedding , their holiday , their new haircut and so on .
We can watch this problem from two different points of view .
From one side , this people chose to become public people .
If we do n't want to be in the newspapers , we do n't do politics or movies !
But from the other , everybody has the right to have a secret garden , the right to be with his / her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers .
The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities .
In conclusion , I would say that both parts , famous people and journalists , have to respect some rules .
As public people , stars and politicians have to accord some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful .
I am writing you to thank for your program which will be for us in the next three days in London .
Especially , sightseeing by bus in the morning and river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon are exciting activities .
On your program of Tuesday is very interesting .
Fortunately , there is the London fashion and leisure show which is held once a year .
This show give us a lot of informations about current activities , fashion and what is happened here in London for example lastest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up , hairstyles .
It is a great opportunity because we will be able to learn london culture . We can be part of this show and be up to date with style and fashion .
The show starts at 10.00 and finishes at 19.00 so we can change our afternoon program to go to the show at Central Exhibition Hall instead .
If you agree , after Science Museum , we can have lunch at restaurant near the musuem , then we go directly from the restaurant to Central Exhibition Hall .
I'am looking forward to hearing your opinion on my suggestion .
Your sincerely ,
" Home " has so much meaning to the people .
It does n't mater who they are , where they are coming from , which color of their skin they have .
Home is institution that create human and make them as a person and a good member in their communities .
When I think of " the Home of the Future " .
Home made out of plastic also windows made out of plastic therefore we can have our home for a long time .
The door it is broken , we can replace it rapidly and it is not expensive when it is plastic .
We have more time to stay together at home , watching TV , playing games , etc .... because we can access to internet at home we can have all informations from internet .
I think it is the best way of education and working when we can stay and learn or work from home .
We have more time for the family who need mostly care and love .
It will be a numer of Developments in Technology in the future , which can make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is feeling of being together and love .
This 2 feelings can not be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home of the future .
You could probably show a little bit more films and interviews with the most interesting artists .
Howe are things going over there ?
It 's quite difficult to talk bout our school rules actually , but I 'll try to help you somehow .
Hope it will be interesting for you . Bu the way , are you allowed to smoke in the school ?
Our teaches do n't let us smoke of course , but you can always see some students smoking outside , so it 's not that strict to be honest .
We 're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teaches .
As for our rules at home , it 's always different and depends just on your family .
My parents are not very strict as you know and I appreciate them for giving me freedom .
They understand that I can make my own decisions , but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother nay time we need it . I think the only rule in my house is to care bout each other .
Dear Mr Helen Ryan ,
I am writing to you and reply the answers from your letter .
I was glad to hearing the news from you and thank you very much !
When you mentioned the period of my travelling I 'm afraid I only free in July .
Because I go on holiday in July naturally , and I have two terms in June and August .
Therefore , I hope that you could make suitable arguement between you and me .
Furthermore , I would like to stay in log cabins which I could feel more American style of the accommodation .
In addition , there should not too hot inside during July .
Because I grew up in my home town that is a seaside city .
I was starting trainning since 1996 , and I have never give it up .
Esepically , it is really good for my healthy during the growth period .
Photography is my hobby that is taken in my spare time . I can remember that I used to take photographs on the exhibitions or during the holidays .
It must be nice for my memories when I am older .
In addition , it could showed people how nice the places are and the views I have got .
Finally , I would like to know the weather in California .
Do I need take too much clothes ?
Could you tell me that the amount of money I can bring during the holiday ?
Your sincerely
Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands .
There are more and more retailors are opening to customer .
Therefore , people used to shopping weekly or monthly .
In my opinion , women are really enjoying shopping .
It seems a human activity during their spare time .
However , we are going to change traditional system to the " e - shopping " .
It is new for customers by technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want .
Therefore , it looks like a service and also boring for customer . I think most of gentlemen dislike shopping .
They are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping .
I believed that most of busy people want go shopping by the easy and quick way .
Because they do n't like waiting for payment and waste time of life .
Therefore , they would like to use " e - shopping " which is getting better for their time .
The life style has change already from past .
Shopping is common activity in their life .
We must focus on the specific life style , which will make us enjoyable .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping only waste time for human life .
And you could n't get back any more .
I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - over the rainbow .
I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which is published on the newspaper .
According to the advert , it says clearly that discounts are available , but when I was buying the tickets , I did not have this offer .
The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes .
Apart from that , the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove , for whom I was coming .
After the show we went to the Theatre restaurant , but it was closed due to the refurbishment .
I am not really satisfied about the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out .
I therefore would like to have a compensation of £ 30 which I spent on the tickets .
Your Sincerely
My story had already been spread out the next day .
I thought I was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustful .
but this idea was soon be put off since I noticed on the newspaper that I had won the writing competition .
I could n't believe my luck , I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Meditarenian Sea .
The last few days , we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping .
Last week , I had a week 's holiday in London , where I haven't been for 2 years .
I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it , we were happy all the time , but , unfortunately , the last day was the worst thing we have got , which was your musical show .
At first , you said that , if we had bought 5 tickets , we would have had a discount , but we did n't have anything .
Secondly , we booked the show at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 , what 's wrong with your clock ? .
Thirdly , someone on stage was very strenge for me , because I expected to see " Danny Brook " , but I did n't .
The last one , we wanted to have a dinner in your restaurant after a terrible musical show , but we could n't have it , because a waiter said your chef had gone home .
I have no idea what your business is , I have never seen something like this .
By the way , I want you to pay my money back for the waste time , and I think that you understand .
Have you ever been in the Countryside ?
Try it , it does n't need to take a long time to live in that place , but it will give you many things , which are different from your lifestyle in city .
Nowadays you wake up in a morning , go to school or work by the sky - train , start your lessons with the computer , go for shopping in a store which has an air - conditioner , watch cartoons on TV , or cook by a microwave oven etc .
Althoug the modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living , can it gives you natural , peace and fresh air ?
How much the technology gives to you , it take from you more .
Have you heard about the environment pollutions , the healthy problems and the moral problems ?
These all happen from human who want to live with science and technology , not the natural which the world gives it to us .
Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment , or I should say angry , better sad . I would never expected that I could be so decepted .
This is not the firt time I have been in your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays , but be sure " Over the rainbow " will be the last one .
As I am specially fond of musicals , I even travel abroad to see what 's new , I am probably one of the most devoted customers . I know this word is not the best but you have demostrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business .
We both know this is not true , or shoudn't be .
When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting , one of my favourites singers , whose career I have been following since the begining , and never appear , and nobody give any reason to the audience , how should one feel ?
Can you imagine how many things one can do instead .
Even listening some music to help us take it easy would had been better than nothing !
None an announcement , not an invitation ...
Well , I will not comment that point .
That terrible place definitively needed a renewal .
Well , this is not my idea of a perfect evening out , as you can realise .
Each time I see the advertising I get mad .
Of course , you shoud make a refund of the money , not only to me but to all the public .
But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back , at least till you continue as its manager .
New fabrics create new textures , all kind of accesories are added to create new versions , to refresh old ideas , to make new proposals that will last , like always , just some weeks .
All in fashion pass away in a couple of months and has to be created again .
Fashion is a part of our lives , even for those who will never reconize it .
Have you notice that all the classic gentlemen wear same tipe of suit ?
And what about this kind of intellectual and progressive people , do n't they wear all the same model of ugly but confortable shoes ?
I am sure that fashion will survive for ages , even it will change to become easier to use and clean , because we all need to feel a part of our society , comunicate our way of living and thinking , be part of a group and , at the same time be different .
I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day in your theatre .
I am afraid but I think that the show was not as good as I expected : the reason were many .
- Danny brook did not play and I wanted to see him .
Please check your times because many people had to leave at the middle of the show .
- When the musical finished I was terrible hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment said that it would be open .
In conclusion that evening was not " my perfect evening out " so I want you to refund me the money .
The modern technology has changed my life in many difents ways :
In on hand we have the advantages the new technology permits you many things like fly , see in the dark , or even save your life when you are almost dead .
But in the other hand we have the disadvantages .
The technology makes your life easier but , until when ?
For example , the car was developed by the modern technology , it makes your life easier but also " dangerous " .
Because too many cars mean too much CO2 in the air .
And all people know that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kind of animals .
To summarize , the modern technologies give and permit you may things wich would be impossible in other times but also gives you many problems .
As for the " Over The Rainbow " presented by your theatre last night , I would like to inform you of the following problems .
Firstly , the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned on the advertisement for this musical show as " Danny Brook " .
As I was so looking foreward to seeing Danny 's stage , I was very disappointed .
I think you should have informed us of changing starring before starting of the show .
In addition , I 'd like to know the reason why the actor was changed .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 mentioned on the advertisement .
As the third point , our tickets were not discounted at all !
The Ad . says that TICKETS : Discounts Available .
Lastly , your theatre restaurant had been closed already when the show was finished , because the time of begining of the show was late .
As above mentioned , it can not be a " perfect evening " .
Therefore , would be grateful if you could give me back some money .
She told about our plan , indeed our " secret plan " , to Sally !
But , Mark , Pat and I were planning a birthday - party for Sally on June 2 at her own home .
Her parents already died when she was in the high - school .
After marriage , Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have their children .
In spite of such difficulties , she always shows a pretty charming smile to us .
On June 2 , because of Pat 's fault , Sally already knew our plan .
We were enjoying at home celebrating her birthday .
" Oh ! You came back for me ! Nigel " Sally cried with pleasure .
Nigel himself was a big " surprising " present for Sally .
I never forget her happy face .....
We spent a brilliant night .
It is a very good shedule , especially because you have considered different activities for us .
Personally , I think it can be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attent to , and we are all fond of the latest fashion .
We noticed that it is free for students so the price of the trip will not rise .
We discussed about the programme , and because the show will take the whole day , we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wenesday instead of having free time all afternoon .
Yours sincerelly
I was n't sure of what to do , and the pressure of everyone watching me , was driving me mad .
I could listen the crowd shouting ' Go , Go ' .
That was my only chance .. Only few more seconds , otherwise my time would be over .
I did n't even think of boking down .
Then , by some ' strange power ' my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it , but it was too difficult .
The clock was running .. tic , tac ... And suddenly everything stopped .
I felt an enourmous peace .
Those minutes , up in the air , feeling the wind in my face , were fantastic ....
Fortunatelly , I was n't alone .
Thank you for your effort , which you have made to organize this three days programm in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there especially in the National Art Gallery .
Nevertheless , the students in my class have some suggestions for you how to make it even more interesting .
The thing is that we have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday , 14th of March , from 10.00 to 19.00 .
Naturally , all the students are interested in it because the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles will be shown there .
Futhermore , students can enter free !
We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show , as it takes place only once a year and only in London .
Probably , you will agree just to put London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday .
Thank you for your attenlion and understanding .
Well , I suppose that almost everything in future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say .
Perhaps , there will be personal computers , which will control every thing , every item of furiture , light , temperature .
But , on the other hand , people will still have to programm them , as they have to do nowadays .
Maybe children will not have to go to school , they just will stay in their rooms and study from computer , some kind of on - line education .
All the rubbish , dust , dirty dishes , plates , caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly .
It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality , voice , eyesight ..
This will be your home , another member of your family and your house or flat together .
This is my opinion of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it .
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW OF THIS THEATRE .
FIRST OF ALL , DIFFERENTLY OF ADVERTISED , THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK , BUT OTHER UNKNOWN PERSON .
TO MAKE MATTER WORSE , THE SHOW DELAYED STARTING AT 20:15 .
AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH , I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT IN THE PRICE OF THE TICKET , ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET .
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING , I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT OF THIS PLACE , BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW .
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED , BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED .
SO , I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND OF ALL OR PART OF MY MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW .
IT 'S UNDENYABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING .
NEWS INVENTS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN IN QUICK PROGRESS . AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE 'S DAILY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGING AS WELL .
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED , I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT , IT 'S WORTH TO POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING :
FIRST AND FOREMOST , IT 'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT .
CONSEQUENTLY , WE'VE GOT FACILITIES TO KNOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND TO CONTACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE , TOO .
SECONDLY , WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE CONDITIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONES , BY INTERNET , WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY , BUT ALSO ABROAD .
FINALLY , WE CAN CONSIDER , TOO , THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES , MAINLY IN MATTERS ABOUT HEALTH , ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON .
IN CONCLUSION , I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGGINING OF THIS CENTURY .
THE SCIENCE AND THE TECHNOLOGY ARE THE MAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS .
Dear Sir / Manager ,
To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected , as it completely contradicted to the advertisement .
Firstly , despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring , another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible , and disappointing .
Secondly the starting time of the show was far from punctual .
I had gone to the show which according to the advertisement was supposed to begin at 19:30 , but the show did not start until 20:15 .
Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be offered .
However by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed .
I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement stating that it would be my ' perfect evening out ' , when it was totally the opposite .
In addition , as a way of compensation , I would like to have a refund , and justification for such a show .
Yours Sincerely ,
How has modern technology change your daily life ?
During these past few decades , or rather , the 20th century , there has been a significant developement in modern technology .
One of the essential developement is the form of transportation .
The invention of cars planes , trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time .
This enables us to save great deal of time and effort .
Quite recently , in my country electrical bicycles have been invented .
This compared to the traditional bicycle is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in small amount of time with hardly no effort at all .
Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances .
There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television , radio , fax machines , and microwaves .
What changed my life most is portal computers .
They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often .
Before I used computers generally , It took so much time for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information .
With a computer however , all this is done in the matter of seconds .
The modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible .
However if we rely on it too much , we could become lazy and apathetic and as a result , would not be able to live without them once they are gone .
I am writing this letter to show whom disappointed am I with the musical show " Over The Rainbow " .
First of all I was expecting to see Danny Brook starring but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared .
When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight .
Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for discount but they were n't available .
When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed .
Modern technology have been changing the human life since the first many was born .
When I wake up I take a shower using eletricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus , when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave than I watch t.v . and do my homework using a pen , when I come back from jiu - jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed .
About a millenium ago every thing was different the people did n't have electricity , they did their food on the fire and they did n't have pens .
Comparing these too realities the reader can notice that modern technology changed very much our daily life .
I am replying in response of the competition I won .
As you asked in the letter , I will write everything I need to know about the travel .
First of all , I would like to travel on July , because during the other months , I will be studying , preparing myself for other exams or I will be out travelling somewhere else with my relatives .
I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in tents , simply because it 's a new experience and I would like to try everything new .
For the two activities I have to choose , I decided to choose a new activitie that I have never done before , which is Sailing , so I am a totally begginer at this .
The other activitie is Photography , I am not an expert , but I know how to use a camera , all I want is to improve my knowledge .
Finally , I need to know what kind of clothes and how many I should pack .
Is there any place that I can wash my clothes ?
I also needed some information on the money I will take .
I will be waiting a reply .
Your sincerely ,
But now I found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped .
All I could think was " Oh my god , I 'm gon na be talking and helping the most famous pop bands ! "
I was so excited that I could n't believe .
When I arrived to help them , they welcomed me and were so nice with me that it seemed we had known each others in ages !
They were n't those kind of people that think they 're gods .
I helped them organizing the stage , cleaning everything , fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars !
I do n't know exactly how I felt , sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream .
I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an answer as soon as possible .
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre .
Last May , I had a week holiday in London , and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW , the MUSICAL SHOW .
I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show .
First of all , when I arrived , I met a note stuck on the front door that informed about changes at actor 's staff .
He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were bad .
Secondly , I want to tell you that the show started forty five minutes later .
In order to the tickets , I want to say that they are very expensive .
I had put some money aside for a month , thinking about the discount , but when I want to buy them they said that discounts were not avaible .
To sum up , the restaurant was closed .
I will appreciate if you could send me my money back .
Looking for your repley .
That is why she could no be a spy .
When she was a girl , Pat used to play spies and detectives games .
Her mother gave a book about how to become a spy for her birthday .
She had watched all Mission Impossible and gadget , the inspector series .
When she finished the school , she went to study to the Agent Trainning Agency where she learnt about guns , clues , agencies , etc .
She was the best student they have ever had .
She was sended to New York to discover how some people from government gave money to the merchants because they want to build a Trade Center there .
At first she walked around the bayside market looking for all the people who were there .
When she saw a man , different for the rest , talking with one of the sellers .
Immediately she interrupted and told to the man that she was a secret agent .
You can imagine what had happened with her cover as a spy .
Here is some further information about myself and a few enquirement .
First of all , I am sorry to say that I could only travel in July .
Secondly , I would like to live in log cabins while I am staying at the camp .
I had bad experience last time I lived in a tent .
I was terribly attacked by a been and it still gives me nightmares !
Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently .
It is really fasinating to challenge waves .
I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future .
In addition what kind of clothes shall I bring with me ?
How much money is appropriate to carry ?
I really wish you were there with me at that one of the exciting nights in my life .
That was a pop concert of Steps in M.E.N Arena .
A few minutes after the concert began , a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable , if something comes up , she should inform other staff .
I was then taken in to cover her job .
I was given lots of paper with many different time on it .
I did manage to " study " them though , thanks to other staff .
They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves .
Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before .
And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well .
I saw all the members of the band backstage , how did they change their make - up , hairstyle etc .
They were even talking jokes with me and other staff .
I was impressed when they kept saying " thank - you " to the staff .
Indeed , they can not succeed without their help , can they ? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know how they work behind the scene .
All in all , it was a once - a - lifetime experience .
As for accomodation I would prefer log cabins , because I belive they are more comfortable then tents .
I never tried those sports , because they are quite expensive .
Could you tell me what are the weather conditions in California at that time of year , because I want to know what clothes to take .
Will I be given any pocket - money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expences ?
First I would like to say that doing a video about daily life at our school is great idea .
Below are my suggestions of what should be filmed .
The computer class can be also there , because program and internet surfing is quite interesting .
Martial arts are realy exciting and are a great thing to film .
I 'm sorry of writing you for such a bad thing , but my evening at your theatre was n't as perfect as you announced : it was n't perfect at all !
I was pleased to see Danny Brooke , he 's my favourite actor , so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the scene !
By the way , what really upset me was the time of starting .
According to your advertisement it was at 19:30 , and , what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15 !
You had promised discounts on the cost which was from £ 10 to £ 20 , but despite my thoughts I had to pay £ 20 without chance .
In the end , I thought I could enjoy myself visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they did n't explain to me .
As you can see it 's not a perfect evening , is n't it ?
I 'm asking you my money back , you can do it , ca n't you ?
Wondering your comprension
your sincerely
As I see it , the Old Man and the Sea is a really exiting book .
The major characther is the old man who has to fight against the sea to keep alive .
This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish something good .
The man keeps immediatly in contact with it .
They 're fighting for the same reason with the same strenght , the man has to kill a brother , as he calls the fish .
If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man 's same thing .
He respected and still loves it .
But , afterwards , the life 's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that 's the most difficulty to face to .
I am writing to giving information about myself .
Even though I would like to travel , I am only in July , because I am a high school student .
Thus I have not got long holiday .
I just have one month left .
On accound to stay in log cabins are as much more interesting than in tents .
As far as two activities are concerned I would choose singing and photography .
I can sing a plenty of songs . which include the english song and the japenese song , and I have part - time job for sining at restaurant .
Although the photography is not as good as the singing , I am very interested in it .
I have been learning since I was 15 year old .
I got third prize in it competition last year and I level is professional now .
Futermore , I am going to have competition next year .
I would like to asking some information about that what kind of clothes I have to wearing and how many your are charge .
Shopping is not always enjoyable , sometimes have a long quare or a mechine was broken .
A lot of circumsenses will have been happening .
I have unpleased experience .
It was in lunch time .
Everybody were went to by luch in supermarket , in fact , nobody liked crowe and quare , expecially in the summer time .
I was quare in the middle of row .
I choose this row because I though it was quicker than other .
Although there were finished two people , next was me , something was happened .
Suddenly the customer though the receipt was not truth , she did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make mistake , they argued about this thing .
The shop manager was coming solution it .
Abviously , I have to chance other row .
I was long quare , I have never had .
Shopping would be enjoyable , if you were good luck .
Even though I think it most of time is very interesting , sometimes make people upsent .
Ideas to improve the Festival
That is why I write to you , to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not .
Firstly , it is a good idea that the Festival is International .
But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all the world and I saw only six nationalities .
Secondly , the classical concerts were excellent and the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk .
Thirdly , I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment .
It attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that .
Finally , the reasonably price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point , because all kind of people an afford to buy it . I also think that you should put a Snack - Bar or a little restaurant so as the people are not too hangry and morever you can realise big benefits
In conclusion , in the whole the Festival was a success , but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve .
I receive your letter and thank you for it .
I am very happy to hearing from you and I hope that you are fit .
As expected , I want to talk at first about my school and then about my home .
So the rules are clear , you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000 .
In our class , we do n't have problem with students who dislike to work , because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there years and years .
In my sweet home , my parents let me do what I want , because I am an adult now .
But when we are in society , we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons .
It is the same in our family and for example my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house or that I let dust everywhere .
When I go out , they do n't give me an hour to be at home , because I do n't exagerate .
In conclusion , I do n't want to change something in my house or at school , because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have .
I hope these few information can help you and I look forward to hearing from you
I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night .
First of all , Danny Brook was not starring , even it was stated in your advertisement , but the main role was played by an unknown actor .
Secondly , I had to wait for forty five minutes for the show to start , and it was 20:15 ( not 19:30 ) when the curtain went up .
Another disappointing thing was that I could not get any student discount , even that your advertisement promised them .
As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one during my week 's holiday in London .
I would like therefore to have my money back , so please send me a cheque for £ 20 to pay the address above .
Every season we can see arrival of new styles , fabrics and proportions .
Let 's try to imagine , what will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
There will be mixture of styles from different times of the past , so if you feel like a medieval princess , you can dress like one .
A new technology and science will change fabrics , so they will change their colour during the day .
In the future people will be even more concerned with pollutions and harmful UV - rays .
With so many choices shopping for clothes is going to be even greater fun than it is now .
Fashion of the future will not be the same as today 's , but it will be more exciting and fun !
I have been very surprised winning .
The answer is the following one : I only can travel July because I have to work all August .
I can take holidays only the month of July .
I prefer the tents because I never use such kind of accommodation .
I have choosen the two following activities .
First one is Tennis and second one is sailing .
I played tennis for many years .
I have even done competitions .
I like a lot this game .
I have choosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport . I love water but I never try this sport before .
Yours sincerly .
The first thing is the place of shopping .
Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping .
The third thing is the trouble of full shops .
Everybody do their shopping at the same moment and often in the same place .
It is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying those things .
People are often nervous and agressive .
When you are a man and your wife asks you to come for shopping , be patient !
Because women loves shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always giving your opinion about clothes , music , parfums ...
I am writing to give you the information it was ask in the letter you had sent me .
Firstly , the best date for me to travel will be the second week of July because I will be very busy in any other date for reasons of work .
Secondly I would prefer sleeping in log cabins because I fell much more comfortable .
One reason is the cold , and the other is that I can not sleep on the floor because I have problems in my back .
The last one I have never tried it but I think I can do it well because I am very tall and that could make things easier .
your sincerily
I 'm very sorry I haven't written you for such a long time but I had to make a travel to my parents house because my mother was operated on ; do n't worry she is all right now .
The things I did were : Prepearing and controling the equipment , I had to clean all the stadium , make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition , that the singers were confortable and relaxed , etc .
The most exciting thing was talking with the band , asking questions to them and of course listening the music and enjoying the incredible show .
It would be a great plessure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I ca n't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm .
First of all , as a reply for your letter , I 'd like to say , that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full - time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time .
According to accomodation I would prefer log cabins , as they are more comfortable and I like convenience .
As to the list of activities I choose climbing and surfing .
I would appreciate if you send me a reply for my Questions as soon as possible
It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account .
I just ca n't understand people who with smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things .
They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous .
So , as a conlusion , I might say that shopping is n't enjoyable at all and I 'd rather stay at home instead .
Sir , Madame
I passed one week in London and during my visit I had the fortune to visit " Over the rainbow " in your theatre .
You wrote that the favourite actor will be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing .
In the advertisement was written that the show will start at 19.30 but it started 45 minutes later , at 20.15 !
Because of the advertisement I thought that I can discount the tickets available but I could n't .
After the show I need to drink something in the theatre restaurant like the advertisement it concieved , but it was closed .
And there was no reason why .
So you can see that it was not a so perfect evening for me then I thought .
Now I hope that you can understand my question for some money back because of the trouble I had .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secretes .
This was the only reason why that she had not a lot of friends .
When Pat came new into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems .
But after a few time the others have seen that Pat ca n't keep secrets .
So they stopped nearly immediately to tell her something important .
Sometimes it finished like this that the others only said : " Hello , how are you ? " and then went away without listening the answer .
During the day she worked hard that she had not to think too much .
But at night , when it became dark the dreams were coming .
She dreamed about good friends , time that was long passed by and she dreamed from someone who she can tell her own secrets .
It was Katha , a girl who had the same problems like Pat .
So they found both the person they dreamed from .
Dear Sir or Madam , I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow , and it has been quite deceiving .
I am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts .
In the advertisement for the show , which I have picked up in the hall of the theatre , are there about five points which were not respected .
To begin with , as far as the starring is concerned , Danny Brook should have performed the main character , and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not .
Insofar as I came here especially to see him play , I have been very deceived , and this could be the understatement of the year , inasmuch as he is my favorite actor .
Apart from it , the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15 !
Could you explain me the reasons of such a huge late ?
Thirdly , the ad mentionned possible discounts .
Personnaly speaking , I did n't saw it and even did n't heard of it : I have asked about it , but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts .
On top of that , the restaurant was closed for renovations !
How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed ?
To put it in a nutshell , and quite honestly , I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spent a " perfect evening out " at all , as it is mentionned in the ad .
For all these reasons , I would like , dear Sir or Madam , that you give me my money back .
I am looking forward to hear from you .
If only Paul had knew it before ...
Everything had begun when Paul went downstairs of the Heavy Sleep .
As he closed his eyes , he started to travel across the dark paths of his councience .
He went through valleys , plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape .
While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey huge stone , on top of which he could stare the whole woods .
Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words " I am glad to meet you , Paul . "
The boy could not beleive to what he was hearing .
How did the beast knew his name ?
" You see , I am a mere product of your mind , but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep .
Please , bring me with you , in your reality ! "
At these words , Paul suddently awoke .
Relieved , he thought that bringing the creature in his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie , and with it , threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape , when he heard a creepy sound under his bed .
He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat it .
Unfortunately ... one our after , a local zoo arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage .
There she died because of not having Faerian food necessary to her survival .
This is how human destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream .
This is how mankind ca n't be relied on .
This is how secrets are betrayed , and the result of it .
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows in the " Circle Theatre " .
The show was called " Over the rainbow " and should be , in refer to the advertisment , London 's newest and best musical show .
I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisment were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook to someone else I was very disappointed .
Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should begun at 19:30 but it started with a delay of 45 minutes .
Furthermore you have mentioned some discounts in your advertisment , but I had to pay the full price although I am a student .
The perfect evening you promised in your advertisment was the complete opposite and that is what I want to get some money back from you .
I am looking forward to an early answer .
We have had a lot of fun together because we had the same interests .
When we were 15 years old we decided to drive with my mother 's car on a day when my parents were absent .
I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know that .
Pat promised me to tell nobody about our purpose .
Two days later my father asked me whether I had thought at any time to drive a car without a drivers license because he had heard that from some parents of my friends at school .
He told me two hours what could happen if I would do that .
I was very surprised because Pat and I were along when we decided to do that .
I felt very disappointed in this moment but I have learned something new about humans ; is you can only trust yourself .
Pat and I have still been good friends but we have never had an other secret together .
I have been very disappointed when I had read your advertisement , I was keen on your show , but I have not seen the same show , I have seen one which it looked like , but not be .
First of all I have been attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who played effectly that evening .
This actors appeared with fourty - five minutes later refering which is written on your advertisement .
This late forbid me to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing !
For all this reasons I do wish that I would not have been gone see that show , for which the tickets were not available .
And as a conclusion I want you to give me my money back , ( I have still the advertisement if you want the prooth what I say ) .
You have the choice , either you make what I want , or I attack you in justice .
Yours sincerly
When I have read this book , I have been fascinated by the will of the old fisher .
This will is so amazing , he has all the elements against him .
His boat is so small and poor , he is old , it is hot and he is alone without any chance to meet someone who could help him .
He doen't want because he wants to prove the little and himself that he is not really old , even if he has a big age .
I think this are the reasons of his will .
He could have triumph othe fish because of his knowledge of the sea but principally because he has known research in the deeper of his mind .
To conclude I think the difficults situations allow us to discover ourself getting out of ourself .
I have just received your letter with congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need .
First of all , I would like to start with the time of the travelling .
I would prefer to go to the Camp on July .
As regards accomodation , I would rather choose staying in tents .
That is because I am keen on hich - hicking and I amused to living in tents .
As to the activities offered I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping , although I am not quite good at the last one .
As regards swimming , it is my passion from the very childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now .
In the conclusion I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information . I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me .
I do n't know much about the weather down there , in California , so I am rather puzzeled about what to wear there .
Besides , I would like to know how much money will I need and which expensies will I have to pay for by myself .
Subject : to suggest what should be filmed for a short video about daily life of our school .
The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see watching the short videofilm about the daily routine of our school .
I have made a little survey on the subject of my report and I have elucidaded that most of the pupils of our school consider that the region and the area around school should be filmed first .
Personally I agree with their statement and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school .
We should film our gardens around school and a pitch with the playgrounds for volley - ball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning .
Next things to be shot , by the majority of students was said to be the teaching process and the breaks .
Here I should also mention the decoration of our classrooms and atmosphere in them .
People should see all the renovations that have been made during the last years and all modern conveniences that were made for both students and teachers .
And as regards breaks student consider them being a very important part of school life , despite all their mess and noise .
And the last but not least thing we should include in the film are the outdoor activities , which our student are provided with in our school . We can make some short shots about the school theatre and it 's performances and also about the sport - clubs and their competitions and awards .
In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey made among the students of our school .
First of all I would like to thank you the chance to do such a gorgeous trip .
We are really looking forward to visiting the city and going to the Museum and Gallery .
We are interested in visiting " The London Fashion and Leisure Show " during our travel .
The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion , hairstyles and make up , and also leisure and sports wear .
Furthermore is totally free for students .
All this exhibiots are really important and exciting for us because , nowadays , fashion has a huge influence in our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it .
We think that we could go there next 14th of March , in the eveninng , instead of going shopping .
This one could be translate to 15th evening .
It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we are totally agree that we do n't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum .
We truly believe you will consider our change .
Yours faithfully
Almost everyone relation famous people with photographers , articles , money , fans , ...
Normally , one people 's dream is to be famous and rich but without that stuff of being without privacy
Nowadays , there is a lot of people that life only with the money they get in advertisments , reports about their last romance , ... but not everyone does the same .
On the one hand you find the ones that are well - known and never talk about their privacy .
They use the publicity exclusive for their work .
On the other hand , are the ones that are also respectabled but , appart from their relation with journalists because of their work , they really need to be constantly seek by photographers .
I mean , they enjoin being the point of view or the center of everyone , even though it means to see their lifes .
Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve their work , politicians for their campain and film stars to make famous their last movie .
Nevertheless , sometimes communications disturb their lifes in a wrong way .
I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found that I won the competition .
This is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in America .
This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays , as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience .
It will let me get up and close with nature , and experience life in the wild .
However , among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best . I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before .
Last before least , I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America .
Will I be going out much , or just stay in Camp California all the time ?
The concert was held at our school hall .
I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment .
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall .
I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular .
It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics .
On the whole , it was a fun experience to work with friends , fixing bulbs , attaching lights and adding speakers .
Yours faithfully ,
Thank you for your letter 2nd of March .
I am very keen on joinning Camp California in the U.S.A.
I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this travel only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August .
I m always been intents when I went with the university camps so I prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in there .
According to your activities at the Camp , I would choose singing and painting because I am a lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity .
Also painting is my hobby because I have always been painting when I have a spare time . I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and How much money I should bring .
I look forward to going with your camp in the near future .
Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable because of different reasons and places .
In the first place , some housewifes do n't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second .
To make matters worse , you forget to buy something when you get back home .
Another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want .
Sometimes when you meet a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no your size left .
The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay everything buy credit card .
When a bill comes to £ 1000 , you would be shocked and regret what you had done .
In conclusion , I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently meet a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully .
Dear Mister ,
My wife an I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago .
My wife and I are both found of theatre , musical shows especially .
It is so rare to see musical in Paris that we decided to book two seats for " Over the rainbow " .
Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly in the theatre .
And we had to pay £ 20 each seat .
But , instead of him , we saw an unknown actor ( who really need singing lessons ) .
Perhaps it was a luck !
So we want you to give us our money back , the show did n't worth the price .
Apparently she was not surprised , but she was surely angry . Really angry ! !
She suspected our father to want to please himself .
Then , we decided to offer her a red bicycle .
Thank you very much for your letter that I received yesterday .
I am very happy that I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at camp California in USA .
Also I am pleased , that I do n't have to pay any expenses .
I would like to travel end of July .
It is convenient for me the last two weeks of July .
In your letter you are asking me to chose which accomodation I prefer .
I would like very much to stay in tents .
Last year I stay in tents with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it .
Summer time the weather is good and I do n't see any problem anywhere I will stay .
During my time in California , I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities such as swimming .
I am good and fast at swimming .
Another sport I love is basket ball .
Hopefull I will meet some other girls in the same sport .
So we all play as a team .
Can you let me know if there is any facilities for washing my clothes If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks .
Shoping is not always enjoyable .
As a housewife I have a good idea about it .
Sometimes I go two days We all have to do our shopping .
It is unavoidable Sometimes it is pleasant , and sometimes it 's not .
I often shop with no problems , but on Saturday is not the same .
Shops are so crowded and it takes long time to find what we want and what we need .
Also we got to face a long queue in order to pay .
Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people .
Usually much more money we spend than we expect .
We ca n't do anything about is .
We have to face it - it has both sides .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not everyday .
I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply for the camp .
Your another consideration was accommodation .
I would like to choose painting which I have been doing for 12 years and tennis .
I would be grateful if you phone me or send me a letter again at your earliest convenience .
Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them .
In the first part of this book it can be seen Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he did n't approve of the government 's attitude to them .
Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist , in other words , he became an activist for the black people of South Africa .
Dear Ms. Ryan , I am writing to you , in reply for your letter .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July , because it is summer season , and it is nice weather to enjoy in California .
Secondly , I would prefer my accomodation to be in log cabins , because I am alergic to some insects that might go in the tent .
In regard to the activities , I would like tennis , because I have some experience playing , and my spin and volley are very good , and painting , because I have some techniques , that I would like to put on practise .
Lastly , I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes , and where can I change my money to American dollars cheaper .
I would ask for your prompt reply , so I can start organizing myself . Thanking you , Yours sincerely , Carmen Dolores Rossell
I hope you are doing fine , I am writing this letter , to tell you about my experience of helping a pop concert .
Firstly , you need to know , and be counscious of what you are doing .
I spend two weeks preparing all the stage , speakers , background , michrophones , everything with all the staff , and every night , the artists came to rehearsal their show , I could see how they really improved , and how nice they were with the staff .
The day of the concert , everyone , including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired , however , when the concert started , we saw that all our efforts were worthy , the crow and artists thanked the staff .
I could see the staff , managers , artists and even the director , all like a big team , working together .
That was what made it mostly special .
I am writting this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called " Over the rainbow " with my wife and children . We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one .
You should have at least informed the public because most of the people came to see him .
However the man who took his place made a good performance , we enjoy listening to him because his voice was amazing .
The times were not respected : the show began 45 minutes late .
Furthermore you did not apologise as if it was usual !
Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people came before .
But I think that if you take care more of the public , your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive .
The ways of transport are improving a lot this times .
The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling .
But cars created pollution : for exemple the green house effect .
But it is also the technology which try to resolve this problem with new way of transport as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities .
Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in sciences like medecine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live older .
I think there is a link between technology and sciences because they need each other : sciences discover technologies and technologies make possible new searches in sciences .
Technology also improved the communications with the phone of course and also with Internet .
Every evening when I come back home I go on the internet .
I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for informations I need for my studies .
In my opinion it 's a lot better than the dictionnary because it 's faster and you really find what you need .
Technology is necessary to our society but I think it could be also dangerous if we do n't use it in the good way .
I am writting you about an enjure that I had in your last musical Circle Theatre .
First of all , I was surpprising that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not played .
Anybody told us why they was n't there .
I read on your advertisment in Friday 's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the representation started at 20.15 .
I was waitting 45 minutes for anything !
I am studiant and I did n't find any discount 's ticket .
I do n't understand the problem between your advertisment and the reality .
And finally , after the show , I wanted to drink a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed !
Like mentioned in the newspaper I did n't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money .
Your sincerely
My life change everyday with the modern technology .
For exemple , if I do n't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework , I am going on Internet and ask for what I need .
In my point of vue , Internet is the most important discover of the 2000 centery . You can book tickets for theatre , sport , etc .
, you can find all informations you need for yourself .
I use all the time Internet for my homework and in the futur , I hope , I will be able to use it for my own work .
Technology will not stop to grow up and help people in the futur .
It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London , since several points did n't worked out as promised in your advertisement .
First of all , there were no discounts available , and having payed £ 20 I had to wait 45 minutes longer than expected since the show began at 20:15 and not at 19:30 .
As a second point , the actor was not Danny Brook , as displayed , but someone else I 've never had heard of before .
His acting and singing was horrible .
At last , after all these disadvantages , I was not able to have diner in your theatre restaurant .
It was closed of some reason I still do n't know .
Therefor , I would like to ask for at least half of my money back .
Pat was a teacher for english as a foreign language .
Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have learned for it in advance .
And always , every body made it surprisingly well .
What was the reason ? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick , when he had finished it to get his opinion .
Nick now had taken a copy of the test to archive it .
And the girlfriend of Nick happened to be in Pat 's class .
She was quite clever and had known everything about this , so she had taken copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared .
It was n't the first time for me to visit this show in your theatre , but it was the worsed one .
At first it was a great plessure for me to get a ticket therefor becauses I 'm one of the greatest fan of Danny Brook .
It 's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had choosen it , because I 'm ( alowed ? ) .
When musical started at 20:15 ( not at 19:30 as showed ) I was realy shokked when I realised that a different actor was playing .
I could n't stay any more and had to leave the theatre .
You have to know that I am very sik because of my blood presure and so I was laying down the hole weekend .
In my opinion it 's a simple way for you to pay me the money I left back .
Otherwise I have to contact my lower .
I am waiting hearing of you .
For me as an scientist it 's a main problem to show how the inovations of the last century goes up with the environment and natur .
In past new technologies mostly followed by ground- , water- or air pollution .
A nowadays simple thing like a computer include so many possible ways to destroy different environmental compartiments .
On the one hand there are the materials from which the PC 's are made of , on the other hand is the uge waste problem situated .
Now I try to show , in my daily work , how the airborn chlororganics , which are degased from plastics , will be seperated and damaged by green plants .
Sometimes it seems to me like joke if I remember all the daungerous materials I need to do my job .
Nevertheless , in my opinion , the only way to find a better kind of living with the nature is to check out the problems we have .
Therefore it make sense to use the inovation which are standing for environmental destructions .
I am writing to answer your letter , which I have recieved yesterday .
First of all , I would like to thank you for accepting me and I am very appreciate that all costs are paid for .
I could travel only in July because my exam will be finished in the beginning of that month and it would be great if I could set off my journey on 15th July .
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy according to the forecast .
I have been playing them for more than 3 years in which I have been trained , 3 years for tennis , 1 year for golf by the professional coaches .
I 'm enjoy playing both of them regularly .
In addition , it would be nice if you could send me an address which I am going to stay , so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family .
In my opinion , shopping is not suitable for children whose age is under 18 !
This is quite a strong opinion , but I know it from my real - life experiences of shopping .
When I was 15 , I was starting to look for new clothes , shoes , and everything I could find now unneccessary .
I 'm not dare to culculate how much I have spent for those things without thinking .
However , it was not bad , my mom always told me that I had n't have earned enough money so that I should n't have spent it in the wrong way .
Therefore , people who is over 18 can think of more reasons than young children for shopping and buying such tempting objects .
To sum up , shopping is not a wrong thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know what you are spending it for !
I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place these 21 and 22 November .
In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good , I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music .
I really enjoyed the plays and films , I wonder if there would be more next year ?
Finally , I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably - priced ticket for the weekend is excellent , we can go where we want to , see what we feel like to .
However , I think a weekend is really too short .
May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week .
As you asked me in it , here are some school and home rules in my country , France .
First of all , and I think it 's a big difference with England , children do n't wear uniforms at school .
Of course when you 're in class you have to behave yourself , be polite with the teacher and the other school children .
During the break too , usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you .
I think nowadays , children are more free and heard , I mean the contact between them and adults .
Usually they know what they 're allowed to do or not and if they do n't respect it , the teacher not only punishes them ( not always ) but also speaks with them .
At home is different , each family has its own rules .
As I am concerned , when I was a child , I was not allowed to stay very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired .
But I was a wise child , so !
There are some rules like " do n't speak with a full mouth " ; " do n't put your finger in your noise " ; " say please and thank you " ; " do n't fight with your brother " ; and so on , but I think it 's the same everywhere .
First of all I want to give you the thanks for this prize .
I have never been in the USA , so I think that this travel will be an unforgetable experience .
Secondly , I will like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school .
After august I must return to school , so I can only go to California in July .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like very much the nature and camping , so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin .
Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting , I prefer swimming and tennis . I think that I am very good in swimming .
I am not so good in tennis because I began to play only two years ago .
Finally , I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and which kind of clothes I have to wear .
Furthermore , I would like to know the money that I have to take and which amount of money is normally spent in the camp .
I look foward to receiving your reply .
Also , you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress , for example .
It can be a very stressful situation because in some moments you do n't know what to say .
In my opinion shopping could be a ' dangerous ' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford . I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping .
Despite shopping is boring I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment .
At first , thank you for your programme .
It is very various and interesting .
We all enjoy it .
But last week we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
This presentation will show the latest fashions and the leisure and sports wear .
We would be very interesting in seeing the english fashion .
At this show we could see different new make up and hairstyles .
For pratical informations , this show start at 10.00 and close at 19.00 .
It will stay in the Central Exhibition Hall in London .
It is not too far and the openning hours fit us .
About the programme , we suggest to see the show on the Tuesday morning and after to do shopping .
As far as we are concerned we prefer seeing the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery .
We also suggest to visit the Science Museum or Wednesday morning and the afternoon , if some one of us is intersted , we could see the National Art Gallery .
I hope you wo n't be too angry for this changing but we would all like to go to the show .
Waiting for your answer , receive our greetings .
For the class
General speaking , homes will change considerably .
They will become less dark and more confortable than today .
People 's homes will build more economically by using natural energies like solar or wind energy .
This improvments will be involved by the lack of petrol and unrecycling energies .
About the size of hous , I think that in cities houses will be more and more little because of the over population .
We also will see very high buildings which contains a lot of narrow flats .
In opposite , in the suburb or in the land , more and more rich people will build big houses .
Homes like this will be build with the latest technologies and very luxurious .
But about differences between rich 's and poor 's homes will be the same in the futur .
I think that people will be as alone and julous as today .
I am writing to complain about a musical show I went one week ago .
Firstly , I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons , I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him .
Moreover , the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour .
To make matters worse , there were not ticket discounts as you advertised .
Because of this I had to buy the cheapest and worst seat available .
As if this were not enough once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance .
I , therefore , request an immediate refund of the £ 10 I spent on your musical show as I believe your theatre is directly to blame .
Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer , I did n't paid attention to it at that moment but as soon as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games .
The years went by and after buying a newer , faster and better PC I found myself writing letters , doing School homework and evening learning with my Computer .
In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk with them , I kept on stucked in front of the screen .
After I got connected to the Internet my life has completely changed .
Mr. Robertson :
First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks about the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon .
After reading the hole organized programme , we all agreed about the sightseeing by bus around London wich will give us the knowledge about this fantastic city we all want to meet since time ago .
The main purpose of our letter it 's to explain about the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
We found the advertisment in a local newspaper article and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity , because the show consists on these topics :
Make up . Hairstyles .
After being discussing , we want to suggest how we think the programme should be re - arranged .
Instead of going to the science museum , we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show wich is opened on Tuesday , march 14 from 10 am to 19 pm .
After that we could continue our trip as it had been arranged previously .
Yours sincirely
Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie - Agatha Christie .
Agatha Christie always was my favourite writer .
Not only because she 's famous or wrote lots of books , but she knows how to introduce caracthers or how to tell a good story us though decieving the readers .
One of her most interesting and famous work is a novel called " The Orient Express " .
In our words the story is settled on a train wich tooks a trip along the orient .
On the train , all the passangers seem to be involved in a crime .
This is such a fasinating story or it 's the way Agatha Christie tells it .
The mistery is kept until the last page of the book .
It has been fabulous experience so if anybody would like to read a good detective story , try to read Agatha Christie 's detective story and you would n't regret it at all .
I 'm terribly sorry but I would notice you about a very disappointing evening .
I 'm sure you 'll read this letter , with the intention of explaining the problems had during the musical show of his theatre .
One of the causes of my disappointing was the different actor that played the show .
I like very much Danny Brook , and his unaspected absence caused on me a big sadness .
Then , musical show had to start at 19,30 .. why at 20:15 there was also the light on ? You 'll be agree with me that 45 minutes to waiting for the starting of the show is a too long time .
The advertisement for the show indicated discounts available and open restaurant after the show but it was n't in this way .
The restaurant was closed 'cause of illness .. of who ?
It 's strange thing !
Greetings
It 's for this reason that now I 'm in this terrible situation .
I ca n't believe she said that , I was at the Maria 's party and 'cause of my distraction , I said Pat that I had lost the Jon 's shirt .
I was agree to buy another one , of the same style , but now he 's angry with me , 'cause I did n't say anything to him .
I do n't know how to do .
He 's my best friend and so he wanted from me all the truth I can give him .
It 's all right , but I also think that he 's too exagerate .
I do n't think of having done a so bad thing to broke our friendness .
I like his company , and we are happy when we are togheter .
I ca n't finished 'cause of a girl that ca n't keeping a simple secret .
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRIME MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW " OVER THE RAINBOW " PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO ; FIRST OF ALL , I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW , BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS DIFFERENT , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING .
AS REGARDS THE TICKETS , I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE , BUT IT WAS NOT SO , AND I HAD TO PAY THE WHOLE PRICE .
MOREOVER , AFTER THE SHOW , I HAD INTENTION TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT , BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT .
EVENTUALLY , YOU PROMISED ON YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT ; AS IT HAD NOT BEEN SO , I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT DEVELOPES ; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES ( AND IS CREATED BY ) STYLISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD , EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY , SOMETIMES ONE OPPOSITE FROM ANOTHER .
I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOPE ACCORDING TO VERY DIFFERENT LINES : THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST , AS WE CAN NOTICE YET NOW , OR A MORE FANTASCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT .
SURELY , ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV , AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE , I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCALIZED ON COMFORTABILITY MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE .
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD , IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE , THAT IS A TOO VARIOUS CATHEGORY .
I am only available in July because I am studying in an engineering school and I 'll work until the end of June .
You asked me which accommodation I would prefer between tent and log cabin .
I am used to spend summer holiday in tent and I like it , but why not try log cabin ?
I would be very pleased if I could practice tennis and surfing .
In fact , I soon practice tennis and I am quiet good at , and it will the occasion to train myself surfing is completely unknown for me and I hope that I will like it .
Finally , I wanted to know if I need money and how many , and if there is a dry cleaning .
We know all what shopping is .
When you got to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that , you look for it but there is no more of it .
Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there is too much people .
But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have all your time ( the girls know what it is ) . finally , when it 's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable , but most of time it is n't enjoyable !
First of all , I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote me asking for my preferences about the Camp .
About the information you needed , I have to tell you that I can only go in July , because of work reasons .
Once there , I would prefer staying in tents , because that is a way to remember my childhood as a boyscout and go against the routine .
From the list of activities you sent me , I stay with the , from my point of view , most relaxing activities available : painting and photography .
One of my hobbies is the photography , so I think I am rather good at it , but I will take painting only to learn , because I am not very talentive at it .
I also would like to know if I have to take money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location .
Please reply soon .
When I knew this , I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepares the stage during the concert .
The day of the show I worked so hard that I could n't see the spectacle .
And I did n't even got paid .
But it was worthy .
I found my reward when the concert finished .
After been carrying stuff like lights , microphones , wires and some other equipment for about three hours , I was eshausted .
But when Britney came out of the stage , she passed by me , saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room .
Write me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me .
I have received your letter this morning and I 'm very happy for this first prize .
It 's a great opportunity for me participate in your Camp California because normaly I work a lot and I ca n't spend money to travel , moreover , I have to maintain my big family because I 'm married and I have three children .
I would like to travel in July because before I have to work with my father because he 's ill .
For de accommodation I prefer a long cabin because it 's more comfortable .
I recognise that I would like to sleep in a tent but in this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it 's better for me to sleep in a bed .
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time .
I have to choose painting and the photography therefore . I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think in my helth .
In your letter you explain me that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life in Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money .
The weather I hope will be good so I suppose I have to bring short clothes .
I 'm very enthousiastic and I attend your answer as soon is possible .
In our society the money is one of the most important aspect to have power .
If we thing about , we will realise that we need money all the day .
Not only for the basic needs but also for the rest of the activities .
Sometimes , they have to buy something that they need but frequently , they buy only to spend money .
This is a big problem because a lot of families haven't money , however spend going shopping .
We have to teach to our children the value of the money , to explain the difficulties to earn money in a job , because we have to work eight , nine or ten hours a day , for example .
It 's a first step to educate the youngest and to help our society .
The money is important but we have to know how to spend it : shopping is not always enjoyable .
I'M WRITING YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK , WHEN I WENT TO THE CIRCLE THEATRE AND I SAW " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
FIRST OF ALL , IN YOUR ADVERTISMENT SAID THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE , BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE .
THE PLAY STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT : FOURTY - FIVE MINUTES LATE .
HE HAD BEEN IN A PLAY BEFORE ?
I DON'T KNOW THE REASON ...
AS YOU CAN SEE IT WASN'T A " PERFECT EVENING " .
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFOUND .
MY ADRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE . I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE .
UNFORTUNATELY , PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS .... AND WHEN SHE KNEW THAT MARIA WAS GOING OUT WITH TIM ( A CLASSMATE ) , SHE TOLD IT TO EVERYONE SHE MET .
IN FEW DAYS MARIA 'S FATHER ( WHO IS VERY JEALOUS ) HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR .
HE GOT VERY ANGRY AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW MARIA GOING OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS .
MARIA TALKED TO HER FATHER AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN HIM THAT TIM IS A GOOD PERSON BUT HER FATHER SAYS THAT SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND .
WHEN MARIA COULD TO OUT SHE TOLD TO HER FRIENDS WHAT PAT HAVE DONE .
NOW NOBODY TELLS HER NOTHING .
HER FATHER ACCEPTED WITH THE TIME .
I am very happy that I have received the first prize in your competition .
I am looking forward my holy day begins on first of july to twenty - first july so it is possible to take the travell in this time .
I like to sleep in a tent under the free sky since I have done the military - service therfore I would prefer a tent as my accomodation .
My favourite activity are swimming and singing .
It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overwight .
I like to singing a song when I am alone .
Singing is good for my emotion .
Also I choose singing and swimming as my activity .
I am a beginner in swimming and also in singing .
Can you say me which cloths I take away for two weeks .
Which kind of weather have you in this time .
Do I need a lot of money etc . for different excursions
Your sincerely
What does means the world " shopping " ? I live and I need different goods for survive .
I need material for drinking and eating , that is the basic fact that I must go shopping for food .
It is not enjoyable to see that the prize for food are going more and more higher .
My salary are going lower than lower .
When I have enough money the price is n't important , then I can buy a lot of goods whitout take care on my money .
Despite I have enough money shopping is not always enjoyable too , because I do n't know which goods I will buy in the future .
Also I will buy goods which I do n't need .
There are many goods which quality is bad in this way the environment pollution will be more and more increase .
This is the fact that shopping is not enjoyable .
I am writing to let you know our unbelievable experiences which we had when we went to the theatre to see the musical show ' OVER THE RAINBOW . '
First of all , I am a fan of Danny Brook but he was absent because of sick .
It made me disappointed very much .
Secondly , although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre , we could not be given any discounts only because we had done at a travel agency .
Finally , I am going to write about the theater , the Circle Theatre .
The show supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
It was your responsibility .
We would like you to pay back the fee of the show and pay us that hotel 's fee as well .
I would recommend you to show that the restaurant is closed on Monday .
If you asked the young people what they spend their money the most in , most of them would answer ' clothes ' .
In these days , new fashions have been passing by very quickly .
From my point of view , young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin .
For example , short skirts and tops like an under - wear .
I think young people would wear smaller clothes which they look like almost naked even in winter .
It could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear , like skirts made of leaves .
Next , I predict about patterns of clothes .
The animal - pattern is catching up now .
It might be possible that the fish - pattern come up in 100 years .
I 'm writing to you to complain about three days programme .
Thank you very much for your good programme , especially for visiting The National Art Gallery .
It starts on Tuesday March 14 and we can go there instead of visiting the Science Museum or go shopping .
Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have a free time .
So on this show there will be the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and even hair styles .
All our class and me would like to see this show .
We do n't need to pay , it 's for free because we are students .
It 's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rare .
I think you 'll agree that we have changed your programme .
As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having a free time .
I 'm looking forward of recieving a letter from you .
Bye
We ca n't say straight away how the people 's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and create the unbelievable things about future life .
Of course there will be differences between todays homes and the future ones .
I think the houses will grow up on twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy it .
I think more and more people will have at least one flat , does n't matter if you are rich or not .
The rooms will be designed in a future fashion like less furniture and everything is compact , even TV - set will be on the ciling .
The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now , and you can have up to twenty rooms in your own flat , and even swiching on the light by saying only ; " light " .
If course if you have enough money to let your self live in such apartments , then you can afford it .
Now what 's going to be the same .
Well as I said if you 're poor , the government still give you the flat but very ugly one , probably with rats in it .
The same problem will be with homeless people who does n't have money at all , even to buy a food for themselves .
They will have to stay on the streets as streets is their home .
I hope and I wish that the future will bring us a good moments of life where everybody will have home and a warm , friendly family relationships .
Last week , I went to London in your theatre to see " Over the rainbow " and I had a disappointing evening .
There problems were ; Firstly , the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were n't there for your musical show , I was unhappy to constat that it was different actors this evening .
Secondly , the show of 19:30 only started at 20:15 ; Thirdly , your advertisement said : " Discounts available " ; but it was n't the case .
Fourthly , the restaurant was closed for renovations and you do n't have to propose us to go .
Like you can see , I 'm very disappointed for this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money .
That 's why I ask you to give my money back .
I ask you give me £ 20 , back by check .
The technology is the future , and the present .
For instance , internet .
All the world is now connected on it .
Internet is the " new " revolution of the communication and knowledge .
It is now ten years that Internet exists , but we only used it for army and government .
Now , everybody who work in commercial companies use every day Internet .
The technology means too , every electrical machines , which do n't stop to be developped .
Another example , computers , every six months , something better is discovered .
The modern technology has changed my daily life in every day .
For instance , the meats , we do n't cook our meals , everything is already done .
Five minutes in the micro - waves and it 's ready .
The machines have replaced the work of the humains .
We use every day technological machines without to know .
All our life is symplifying by the machines for not waste the time to work on their developpment .
I write you this letter because I want to tell you my experiences of the festival .
I have spent two days at the " International Arts Festival " and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time .
For example , on the leaflet it was written that there will be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries .
Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place for everyone and you could not enjoy anything !
It was a small offer ; I hope it will be larger the next time .
There have also taken place very good attractions like dance shows , the art exhibition and listening to talks by writers ,
This was a clever way to attract people 's attention
At last , I would like suggest a " pony - ride " for children , to attract families .
Please tell my your opinion about this .
I think there are some possibilities for earning money .
I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils , for example , maths or english .
To teach pupils is not easy , of course .
But I think that after some lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff .
So it would be easier for the teacher !
It is also not a dirty work , I mean you do not have to clean rooms or toilets of other people !
And you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers if you are working in a shop .
To be a good teacher you especially need patient and good nerves !
And the money you get is not less
So , if you like to b with people and help them and if you have talent to explain good then it would be the best , if you offer your help to the people !
Dear Helen Ryan : Thank you for letting me know about my prize to Camp California in the USA .
Here I will answear all the questions that you ask me , and I will ask you other things that you dind't mention .

Thank you very much for your colaboration .
sincerely Teresa Reina
Most of the time when we go to the shopping Center we have a lot of fun , we go to stores to see cloth , we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries , but not all the time shopping is enjoyable .
Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not a good company , we usually do n't have a great time , or when we know what we want to buy , but when we get to the store they do n't have what we want , in that moment we neat to shop also when is an important day like Father 's day or christmas every where we want to go and buy something is very crowd so we ca n't find what we are looking for with calm because everybody is pushing you to the other place that you want to go
In that cases is when we do n't enjoy shopping because we ca n't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping center .
First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your care about your customers .
I was absolutely threaled to resive news about my win in a competition .
Your letter contains few questions about detailes of my holiday which I would like to clarify for you .
The first is time .
I am only able to go on holiday in July , because the other time I have college , which I ca n't be missed .
I old rather prefer stay in log cabins than live in tents .
I do n't like night cold and moscitos .
I so glad , that I will get chance to do activities in the camp .
I play basketball and at tennis .
I quite good at tennis .
What about basketball is .
I played in school team , and was one of the best players by the end of this season .
It is clothes and money .
Should I have any special , if yes what kind of wear it is .
Can you inform me how much money should I have and can I have some information about prices to visit local places of interests .
At the end I would like ones more to say thanks for your letter and I look forward to hearing from you by post with all detailes about holiday .
Yours faithfyly
I hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it .
In my opinion , it dependes on your mood , your financial ability , off course where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy .
Usualy people do n't have time for shopping .
You 've just finished your long hours at work , you tide , you had row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping .
And what you have .
There are huge queus to tills , noise , hussle , poor custumer service .
You 've got more stress , you feel fed up and finaly when you got home you think that shopping is not that enjoyable as you thought .
For example a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores .
There are so many varaity of products , different prices , different quality .
You should walk miles around store to find what you wanted .
Yes , there is big plus for big store of course .
You can find everything in one place , instead of small shops which is specialised on one product .
And people spend all weekends walking around shopping cities and high streets in trills to buy something .
Nower days tecnical progress gets close to us , to usual custumers .
Internet is one of the issue at this problem .
Without any hussle , seating in your chear in front of your computer you in second can get in at any shop who has internet site , most of the big companies have it , get all information about product , get cheaper price and buy it .
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning of the competition .
I am writing to inform you my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping .
First of all , I would like to travel in July because I can apply my holiday only in July . I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July .
I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to feel wilder experience .
While I am at the camp , I would like to enjoy swimming and photography .
It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy fresh air .
Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take nice photos in the camp area as many as I can .
And I want to know how much money I have to carry for personnal expences .
I also want to know if I can have a time for shopping .
I have just received your letter which made me so happy and I am writing to apply your questions .
First of all , I can travel only July because my son 's school is going to finish at the end of June , so it is impossible for me to travel during on June .
Apart from that I work in an international tourism agency and August is the busiest month of the year so July is the best choice for me .
I would rather stay in tents because I used to go camping when I was a teenager with my family .
I took some lessons and after that I have really improved it .
Beside this , I am very good at playing basketball .
I used to play in high school 's team .
Could you please give me some information about it and what kind of clothes should I bring for my holiday .
Besides , I really would like to know , approxiametely how much money should I take with me ?
I hope all those information will help you .
I am so sorry that I could n't write you last week .
As you know , I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked as a director 's assistant during the last week .
First of all , it was a very successful concert and probably you have heard the singer 's name before who is called Tina .
As a director 's assistant my job was arrangement of the audience 's seats and tickets .
All seats were brought from a sponsor company .
Everyday I worked for two hours in a shop to sale tickets .
It was quite enjoyable because everyday I met different people who like listening the pop music so we had lots of things to talk about .
I also helped the singer 's some special demands which were n't so difficult to do .
At the concert night , I worked as well .
After the concert I was absolutely exhausted but the thing is I will never forget this experience .
The best thing was of course Tina .
We promised each other to keep in touch and she has invited me her next concert !
So , my news are finished .
Write me back soon .
Dear Helen
I never been in the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California .
I can only have some holidays in July from the 3rd to the 17th with my husband at the same time , that is why I would like to travel during those two weeks .
For the accommodation I would prefer to have tents because I used to travel in Campsites and I love it during summer , just to change the customs ! !
Concerning those activities I have choosen two of them .
I enjoy swimming and anytime I have opportunities to swim I go .
My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that is better to join one sport and one " soft leisure " and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I do n't know for my holidays .
Please could you tell me about the weather if I need special clothes and about the money for the change if you do n't mind .
Yours Sincerely
" Shopping is not always enjoyable " " Shopping today ! " You decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a " shopping destination " , that is mean that you need something special for you or someone else . You have the money and the time as you want .
Save some money to go for shopping in Paris or Roma and see how is the French or Italian fashion on yourself ! and after that you can make a stop in the Duty - free and buy some chipper souvenirs .
Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping , and it is really nice to go there with money to buy that you always wanted to .
But even if shopping can means dream it can be boring sometimes .
If you have no money and a friend ask you to come for shopping , it should be boring ! and you become jealous against him and want him to do that quickly ! or you are going to get nervous !
And you can find too much people in shops , it is too hot or you can not have your right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry ! or you decide to not spend money in shopping today , but in front of the shop .
So , you 'd better to stay home today ...
Dear Madam and Mister
I am writing to you about your theatre : ' over the rainbow ' .
It played an other one who played very bad .
Secondly , the musical should start on 19.30 , but we had to wait until 20.15 !
It was boring that nothing happend such a long time on the stage .
Why do you write things on your advertisement when nothing is true ?
And finally , I would had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I go to ' Theatre restaurant ' .
But how can it be , it was closed !
This are too many negatives points for one evening .
I am afraid , but I want my money back .
I hope you do not disappoint my in this point .
Your faithfully
This is not a tabu by me and my friends .
We have discussed about it a lot of times .
I have dout when somebody said , that the fashion of the future would be different .
I think it is very difficult to change the clothes and the fashion so much again .
We have so many kind of clothes and fashion behind our old generations .
Maybe , the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter , the shoes moderner so that you can not walk in them anymore .
Maybe in 500 years , some people will live on the Mars and then , they have to wear other kind of clothes .
But I do n't think this clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth .
I am very happy and excited because I have won first prize in our competition .
I am writing to enquire you about some doubts and to give information that you need about me .
I have been working hard here in Portugal and I will be on holiday just in next july .
Because of it I believe it is the best date for travel You asked me about accommodations or Camp California .
I would prefer to stay in tents because I suppose I will have more contact with natural things than in log cabins .
I would love play tennis and basketball that I 've been playing for six years .
About tennis , I just started to play last year and I need to increase my technique too much .
Are they inclued in the prize ?
How much money I can spent during this time ?
I 'd prefere if you give me this information as soon as you can .
I am look forward to hearing from you
I 'm too excited and I have to tell you about a fantastic experience that I had last month .
I suppose you know about " Portugal Pop Concert " that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month , are n't you ?
I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all time , what was n't very difficult .
You will ca n't believe how many famous people I known .
It was a dream and she was amazing with me .
I did n't tell you , but I helped in this concert just by a chance .
A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place .
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressed situations .
However , these days were unforgatable to me .
Hope to hearing from you soon
I have just received your letter in which you inform that I won first prize of two weeks at Camp California .
I would like to travel on July , since I am studying and that is the only month I have for vacation .
Fortunately , I have heard that weather is beautiful in California during that month .
I 'd rather sleep in tents because I want to enjoy this wild experience !
Could you please tell me what kind of clothes do you recommend for the camping ?
Cordially yours ,
The best way to go shopping is when you think in advance what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend .
The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stress or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives .
It may seem relaxing at the beginning , but if they take their credit cards with them , the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills ! !
Wait for a sunny day , take a look into your wardrobe , some money , ask a friend to go with you , and enjoy an exciting shopping !
I will be very happy to travel on july because in that date I am going to have my holidays , so I will not have to ask permition from my work .
At the same time , on july is my birthday , so it would be nice to celebrated there .
I will prefer to have my accomodation in a tent , couse in that way I can feel more clouse to the nature , and I can remember when I was a scout girl .
Sleeping in tent is much more exiting and clousy than a log cabin .
At the camp I will like to choose two activities , Painting and Singing , I love painting , in the university I studied art for two years , but now I do n't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby .
So I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp .
The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice , so maybe I could get it better .
I will like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenires .
Thankeaw for givin me this oportunity .
You are never going to believe what I did last month I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus , when sudently a man stop us saying that he was looking for people to help in a concert and they was going to pay us five pounds an hour .
We sed yes inmidiatly , I nearly shouted of happines when they told us that , Luis Miguel was doing the concert , he is my favorite singer .
The concert was on a sunday and we had to work on the back of the stadge , doing all sorts of things like colecting rubish and helping other people that was working there .
We was so close to him , I did n't have the chance to talk with him but I do n't mind , I will never forget that day .
Since then , me and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day .
I hop you write me soon to tall me you re opinion .
I am writing to complain about the musical show " Over the Rainbow " that has been presented in the Circle Theatre .
As I was very anxious to see that show , I planned to go to the theatre in the last holiday , and I am completely disappointed with that .
First of all , I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there .
For example , the actors that were announced to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , the discounts were not available and the principal point : it started forty five minutes later .
I wonder you could explain me why .
Due to my huge dissatisfaction , I would like my money back , as you do not make what was advertised .
Every day , the growth of the modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody 's life .
The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good aspects to my life , like the facility to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image in my cab TV and in my computer .
On the other hand , the excess of comodity can led us , in the future , to a completely " cold " world , because of the distance between people that can be caused .
Another bad points can be mentioned , like the polution for example .
Despite the bad aspects that the modern technology can bring , in my opinion , if the governments tryed to do the best , and if everybody contribute with a little bit , we can solve the main problems and only take advantage of the benefits to our lifes .
I am writting to you to complain about the musical show , wich everything was completely different from the advertisement .
To begin my complains I can start with the actor - was a different one , not Danny Brook .
Tina Truelove performed marvellous , but him I think he is a " street actor " from Covent Garden .
Even worse it was the delay , the Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , that drove me mad .
I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for discount ticket , I could not get it , it was really unfair , I paid normal price .
Also there was another problem , I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show , I could not , was closed because it has been refurbished and redecorated .
Anyway , I expected to have a perfect evening out however I had just a terrible time , everything went wrong .
The only thing to do is : to compensate me , send my money back , I am sending my ticket for that : Hope you 'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further .
Twenty first century - technology , technology , and technology .
Modern life it has been full of science and tecnologies .
I am very pleased that I born under such good tecnologies like my parents did n't have the same luck .
My life is much easier with all these stuffs above mentioned - tecnology and science .
Computers have changed people 's life , many of them can work from home , they do n't need to go to their offices .
Internet is very handy , you can buy , send e - mail messages , or even have sex , that is really funny .
There is ambiguity about technology - can bring good things and terrible things as well .
One good side is making life easier - computer , mobile phones , vending machines , etc ....
The bad side is to use tecnology for war - missiles , weapons , etc ....
Indeed tecnology has changed our lives , we have become more scepitical and cold .
I believe that people should take just good advantages that .
Sometimes I think tecnology is not a good thing ....
I have reading the letter and I was very surprised that I have won the first prize .
About the time when I like to travel is only July , because in the summer is it very busy at work .
People where I working with they are going on holiday in Juni and August .
So hey need me at work in that months .
Further the accomodation I prefer at Camp California is the log cabin . Because , at first when I was a little child we were staying every holiday in a small house and I like that .
At second , I do n't like tents and I do n't get used to it , so I prefer log cabins .
About the different activities we like them all , but If I choose two I take sailing and tennis .
In the summer I 'm sailing races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes .
I 'm not very good in Tennis but I can practise on my travel .
Which things I must paid for on my travel ?
With me is everything fine and the pop concert was great .
I enjoyed helping at the popconcert , but it 's very stressful work .
You always walk from side to side to move things and there 's no break .
Some other work what I have done was to lead the people to there places .
We have worked the whole day and luckily at least we had some food .
The most beautiful things were that we saw famous singers and I spoke with Robbie Williams .
He 's friendly and very handsome off course .
If you see the famous singers in reality they are different and the most singers they haven't time for you .
Another thing I have done was the make up only for about fifteen minutes .
That was very nice , because I did n't expected that .
There were some people they gave me some advise to clean the face and etc .
Finally , it was a very nice day with great experience .
Loves
At first , I would like to go travel on July , because before them I do n't have time to travel .
I have to finish my study .
Secondly , I want to stay in log cabin .
And I would like to have a chance about painting and photography .
I am not so fit and well condition , so I do n't like to do activitily .
However , to draw some beautiful sceanary and to take some picture are very good experience for me .
I hope so much .
Do you like the shopping ?
Generally many women would like the shopping include me .
However , whenever you go shopping , are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy the shopping ?
Perhaps you have an experience unpleased .
Then you could find the cheapest good and in that case , you probably buy it needlessly .
Moreover you bought something then you could find it is a little bit expensive than the other shop .
Both cases are often happened in shopping .
If you do n't want to regret about shopping , you have to make a shopping list firstly before going shopping .
Then you should check the price and the quality of the good .
One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are going only a window shopping .
I have recently been to London on a holiday trip so I decided to spend my free - time going to the musical show you were advertising for .
It seemed very attractive and the different informations on the ad pushed me into going to it .
I 'm not keen on liars Mr Smith and I think that you 've lied to such naive tourist like us : some brilliant actors were supposed to play the part and we only had different and pityful ones .
Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed of forty - five minutes .
I ought not to talk about the restaurant closed for no apparent reasons
You had promised a perfect evening but I spend an horrible one and you ruined my holiday !
What are you mistaken us for , Mr Smith ?
We did not deserve such bad show .
Otherweise I 'll have to put some others ads in London saying that your show is just a fake !
To begin with , I 'd like to underline how the place of technology has increased since a couple of years .
With the end of the Second world war and the economic prosperity many goods like TV , washing - machine , etc . became cheaper and available .
Nowadays , the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite seem to take the lead .
As far as I am concerned , the first way modern technology influence me is in my work : the internet has become such an incredible tool , I can make research about everything I want , find informations for lectures for example or exercices .
Nevertheless , new technology has made me become more lazy .
I spend a lot of free time watching TV , or surfing on the Internet or playing the computer .
Maybe it change me into a kind of self - centered person , a loner .
But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in way to communicate .
But we should not forget that it 's only tools and emphazise human relationships .
You have sent me a letter about the competition first prize I have won .
You asked me about some further information .
First , I 'd like to travel on July at any time from the first to the 30st because of my vacation period . I 'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare me .
Second , I 'd prefer have a log cabin where I could let some stuff .
Finaly , I 'd like to practice tennis and to try climbing .
Is there any ability required ?
Could you send me a note about travelling in California which could help me ?
This book stays one of the best american litterature book .
It is classified as one of the ten books that should figure in your own library .
But it is also the most famous short story from Ernest Hemingway .
Based on a very simple story , the story of an old man fishing , it allows a deep reflexion about oldness .
A veteran fisher takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other mans that he is still able to do that .
Then , Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing act and of the great fight between the fish and the old man .
The 24-hour fight is described in a so peacful , faithful way that it callas a though about life and death .
I recommand this book a lot both to discover Hemingway and american litterature .
Before answering your letter ( which I have just recieved ) about the prize of the competition I recently won , I 'd like to tell you thank you very much for giving me the chance of gong to the USA .
I have been asked to say when I would like travel .
About the accomodation ; I rekon I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent , since it is more comfortable .
During my two week sat Camp California , I 'd like to practice climbing and surfing , whose basics I know perfectly well .
I am quite good at both because I do usually practice them .
Furthermore , I love to go through such sports !
In addition to this , I would like to know the ammount of money I should bring , as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that I will find there .
It has been so long since I wrote to you for last time ...
Hey , guess what : I gave a hand to a friend at a pop concert !
It was great , and I got my entrance for free !
I agreed unwillingly , as I could n't imagine how a pop concert looked like ... but when I came in I changed my mind !
None of the groups were known nowadays , but I belive they are well on their way to becoming famous bands .
My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff , and stay there after the concert to clean everything .
This was the best part because when everyone was gone , Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginers ! ! !
What was a fella like that doing in such a place ?
I could n't belive my very eyes ...
Jane took a photograph of us toghether .
Lots of Kisses from
Dear Sir and Madam
I am recently spending a week 's holiday in London , and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain with couple of things .
First , I like to complain about the main features which is an actor , he might have been well known in England , but on the night , he performed abysmally .
Secondly a lot of people were not very impressed with the time , because all of us at least have to wait for almost an hour until the show start .
Also , a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities which said to be serve in an advertisement .
For example , the discount for the tickets were not available , and especially a lot of people were disappointed that they can not visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed , due to the cleaner forgotten to clean up the mess from the previous party .
Lastly , I think I could not call this as my perfect evening , so I would like to ask for a refund , and I hope as a Manager of London 's newest theatre , you would handle the situation favourbly .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , although he 's one of my best friend , but sometimes , he 's a real pain in a butt .
Pat and I knew each other very well , because we are neighbours , so since we 've met , Pat and I always got on very well .
We always go to the same school , and he 's often make more friends than I do , and everytime he 's always introduce them to me .
Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality , he 'll never be able to keep any secreats for anyone , even himself .
Although , we are great friends , but sometimes people can make such a stupid mistake , and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight , it all started when once I accidently , took the wrong bag back to my house , and there was lady 's knickers inside , I was so nervous and embarassing , so I tell Pat and there he goes , he tell every single students in the school that I 've stolen girl knickers , and everyone started to call me a pervert .
Anyway Pat eventually apologized to me and we still being best mates as ever .
Firstly , there was a different actor / actress who I have never heard their name before .
It was going to start 19.30 .
Afterall , I lost my find return train after show .
thirdly , there was no discount about my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired .
It was perfectly terrible evening out .
So , I want you to give my money back to me .
If you do n't do that , I will tell public what you are wrong in your advertisement .
Your sincerely .
When I was a yong child , I used to be interested in reading a scientific fiction .
Interestingly , nowadays , I live in the scientific world which I read in the book .
Probably , I started useing mobile - phone 5 years ago .
Before using mobile - phone , if someone wanted to talk to me immediately , they could n't find me where I was .
However , nowadays , it is easy to find me because of mobile - phone .
However , After appearing Internet , I 've sent e - mail to my friends .
It takes just a few minutes to send e - mail to some one .
I just check my e - mail before going to bed everyday .
In conclusion , Because of modern technology , I 'm very comfortable and do something effectively with computer and mobile phone .
Mrs Ryan
When I received your letter , I was very surprised and happy because I do n't remember that I did this competition .
First I can travel only in July because , I will finish school at the end of June and I will pass my exam in Septemeber ; so I have to repeat it a lot during the month of August .
To answer your second question , I choose the accomodation in tents because I like to sleep outside .
For the activities , I choose the Golf and the Surfing ( that was n't easy to decide which activities I will do , cause almost choice interested me )
I tried the golf twice , I 'm really bad but I hope to do much progress .
I never did surfing , but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic .
How many money will I have to take with me ?
Thanks for all
I 'm sorry I can only write now because last week I have too much work .
As you asked me I will tell you about the pop concert of last month .
With my friend Miko we looked for a little job during a week - end and one evening we met a guy who wanted to buy some drinks in the pop concert and so we told him that we were agree to help him at the bar .
It was a wonderful week - end : we were opposite to the singers and we have seen every concert without buying any tickets entry ! ( we were include in the staff of the concert )
At the end we have 1200 . - of benefice and each us take 400 . - for himself
I particulary like seeing all this people , and I meet a lot of new friend there .
For next year we search for a new barwoman .
I would like to travel only July because I would be in schools holydays and the weather is hot and the sea 's temperature is less cold than in winter .
I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip which is boring ? !
And when the sun is shining you are relax and you feel good .
I would prefer tents to sleep at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents to compare in a house .
You are in communication with the nature and you can hear the insects .
It is very nice to stay in tents wich are strong and confortable .
From the list below , the two activities I will choose are Tennis and sailing .
Tennis because I play Tennis and I am classed 15 - 5 .
I like very much Tennis because it is a technical and physical sport .
And you need strategie to win the match .
It is nice to play tennis outside in the court when the weather is hot .
But you ca n't play if there is too much wind , the ball becomes incontrolable !
Windsurfing because I pratise it for a long time .
I like windsurfing because it is a sport of speed and slide like skiing , surfing .
you need technics to move the windsurf .
You must know how to use the wind and you have great sensations !
I would like to ask you questions : Must I take with me my clothes ?
Do I need some money to pay the meals !
you have recently had a class discussion about shopping .
Now your english teacher has asked you to write a composition , giving your opinions on : " shopping is not always enjoyable "
In fact , shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy articles but you do n't have enough money !
You can hesitate to choose an article .
Which is the best article to take ?
The seller can be not very nice and watch you all the time .
You do n't find your size or the good color in the article .
The article can be too expensive .
It looks fragil and it could break easily .
Your must test several shops and compare the price , the quality of the articles .
So you must walk all the day or go by car .
And the weather must be fine if you walk in the town .
Shopping is not always enjoyable if there is a lot of people in the shops because you ca n't move and choose the article and be cool !
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country .
The best time to travel for me is July because I am working and only then I can have holidays . I would be pleased if it is possible .
About accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in the tent and I would like to try it .
It will be very interesting for me because normaly I have not a lot of time to do activities .
I would prefer swimming because I very like it and I am trying to swim anywhen I have got some time , and painting because I have finished painting course and I have some practice with this .
That is very nice that every costs are paited for but I would like to ask you how much money I should to take with me because I do not now anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please to tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me , so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activite .
Thank you for the letter and I am looking forward an answer .
Thank you for answer on my last letter , I hope your sister 's health is better than on last time and she is all right .
My life is a little bit changed after that concert on last month .
I will try to explain you why .
As you now I was helping to make every decorations before and during the concert .
It was realy wonderfull new experience for me .
I have never before met so many people and I did n't now that is so hard to keep everything in order during the concert .
Now I now that everything need patient , time and hard work before someone will sing any record on scene .
The people were wonderfull , they was helping each other with everything and it was a lot of easier to do .
It is very nice feeling when you need help and is so many people which want to help you .
I am writing to you , because I would like to disagree with your advertisment for the show ' over the Rainbow ' .
I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening I your theatre .
At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage , but there was totally different actor .
As it is said in advertisment the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes , because by the programme it started at 20.15 , but that was not the end of the story , in your advertisment it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets , that was not true !
I was not still very disappointed , because I hoped that I will have a good meal with glass of wine in the restaurant , according to your advertisment but what did I realised , it was closed , because the chef was in the hospital .
I did not have a perfect evening at all and I would like to ask you to return my money back .
Everyday we keep in touch with technology .
We have microwaves that help us to do our meal quickly , we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes , we have different things that made our life easier .
I use different technological things everyday .
Such as mobile phone that helps me to communicate , with anyone in the world , even if I am not at home , I use stereo , if I want to listen to my favourite music , I use tapes , CDs , hairdryers , ect .
I think that all these things made my life much easier .
Many years ago people did n't have an oppotunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot .
I am very happy that with all technology that we have we do n't have to work as much as they did , like to wash plates and cups after meals , my dishwashing machine will do that for me , and I do n't have to wash my clothes my washing machine does it better .
Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over humans and of course it makes me lazy .
However now I have more freedom , free time , and privacy .
This is just a note to confirme you , what I had recive your letter .
I am so happy to have won this first prize in your competition . I will be happy to be for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am understud from your letter , what all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me , including transport to and from the airport .
To answer your questions , I would like to tell you , what my travel can be possible only on July , because I will have the Cambrigge exam till 1 July .
Would it be possible to have accomodation at Camp California in a tent , because I did n't have chance to sleep into it .
And would it be possible to do swimm and surf .
I am very good swimming .
I done it since I remeber me .
In surf I am not good at all .
I have been driming about this activitie since I had 10 years old .
I would like to know about how many peopl will stay with me into the tent , and have a take with me special clothes for doing serf .
I will contact you , if I will have more questions .
I look forward to beeing at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Your faithfully
I like shopping . I love to do shopping .
But if only I have money ! ! Ore some money . Shopping ca n't be enjoyable if you do n't have money to spend .
I 'm thinking do shopping in the big spaise like Harrodss it 's not plesure .
Because it 's crowding of people .
I 'd like to be in small boutiques , and I would rather go to shopping along and during the weekand time .
Because I do n't like to give some advise it 's can be willy boring .
And go to shopping at the end of weekand it 's not for me .
I do n't know what I can tell you more ?
Drop me a line or give me a call if my writing will not so good for you .
And I 'll mees your lessons .
I am sending you this reply with the informations that you need .
I would like to travel on july because I am a studant therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year .
About the acomodations I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to stay in it when I travel .
The activities that I want to do in the camp are Basketball and Surfing .
Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall as well as I use to play it very well .
On the other hand I do n't know almost nothin about surf but I would like to learn and to practise the sport because I think it cool .
It 's about how much money I will need to go out at night , to spend with food and this kind of thing .
Yours Sincerely
There are people that loves going to the shopping .
They are addicted in buying things .
Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer .
He ca n't stop buying things , he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes do n't use .
I think this one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem .
Sometimes , shopping can be really bore especially in important dates when the shop are absolutaly crowded and you ca n't see somethings as you wanted with carefull .
13th JUNE.2000
I received your letter in this morning and thank you very much for your kind letter and chosing me .
I can only travel in July because I had already booked and fully paid for a middle - east holiday , from 25th of July till end of August .
If you can arrange my departure time from 1st of July it should be convenience for me .
I would like to stay in tents because I had much great times in tents during my previous holidays , if it is suitable for you .
I want to do this two activities while I am at the camp : Sailing and photography .
I have great experience for sailing . I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey .
And I have done certificate for using radio ( VHF ) .
I have knowladge about navigation , engine , ropes and knots and sails as well .
My other passion is photography , especially I like black and white photography . I have a camera which is a called Minolta X300 .
That is a manual camera . I know to develop films and print them .
I have doubt about clothes , money and immigration rules of the USA .
please could you write me how is the weather like there , what kind of clothes I need and how much money I should have .
Yours Sincerely .
I like shopping but I had a bad experience about my recent shopping .
I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and products .
First of all I went to a local shop but I could n't find enough selection of products .
It was very crowded , I could hardly walk in the shop .
I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer .
When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone .
My money , travel card and credit card .
It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop .
I went to the shop assistance but it was useless .
As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it .
it costs me about £ 500 .
This experience has changed my shopping habit , now I do all my shopping on the internet .
But I 'm not sure how it is safe .
But you must be always award against to pickpokets .
Dear Helen .
I have received your letter which is make me happy .
The first time in my life I have won competition . I would like to attempt your invite in July .
I only able to take my holidy in July , rest of the year I work .
I would prefer to stay in tent .
I do n't know why but I have feel toward to tent from my childhood .
When I was kid I used to ask my mum to buy me a tent for my bedroom to sleep in there instead of bed .
I 'm crayz about tennis and swimming .
I used to take tennis and swimming lesson when I was high school .
I have good talent and skill about them .
Most of the weekend I go for swiming and tennis .
That is the fun for me to doing it .
Do I have to bring some cash on me ?
Do you think travel chaque would be more secure ?
I also would like to get some information about weather .
What does it like in July over there ?

I ca n't stand on the long queue .

It is annoyed .
There are a lot of option and item make our chose difficut .
it is hard to make decide which suitable for you .
After shopping you have to carry havy bag long way to home
I had n't a good time !
There was an other actor , James Kee , but I did n't like him ! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he was n't there .
In addition to , the show did n't start at 20.15 ; so it ended at 23.45 and I could n't go to a meeting .
I 'm very disappointed for all these problems !
The ticket 's price was £ 20 and there was n't any discount !
I had n't a great fun , so I ask for money back .
Your faithfully
In fact , some days before Karin , a friend of hers , had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John , her science 's teacher .
Pat was astonished , and did n't know what ( she ) had to tell Karla .
This age 's difference was too big !
So she decided to tell Hill all the story .
Hill like Pat very much , but only as a friend .
He was 19 ( years old ) , so Pat thought , that he had to know what was the best thing to do .
But the situation was n't simple , so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary , the teacher 's cousine .
So they went to talk with her about the situation , but when she knew that they had know her feelings to Mr. Beek , she decided not to tell Pat anything forever .
I write to you to complain about the dreadful evening I had when I went to see your show at the Circle Theatre the 9th june .
To start with the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did n't perform as told .
They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed a musical .
If I had only one reason to ask you for my money back ; it would be the latter .
But to add to this I had to make a long queue to get a full price ticket when instead I had brought my student card on the purpose of getting a discount which had been advertised but did n't in fact exist .
The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore me and my friends were n't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed on sanitary reasons .
For this deceiving and uncorrect advertisement and for all the given reasons , I ask you for an average refund of five pounds per ticket .
This feature did n't allow you to tell him much about yourself .
He was n't really wicked , he merely did n't understand to keep his mouth shut , especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called " private life " runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and did n't even know .
But small drama can grow up as children are very sensitive .
I believe this is a rule of society , it 's a sort of group behaviour , and belongs to the childhood and the teenage .
According to me what is more to regret is when now we full - growns continue to act with this bad habit .
The criticism spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets .
What allows us to reveal parts of someone others privacy , nothing .
Thank you very much for granting me the first prize - Camping in California .
I would like to have my two weeks with you in July , as it will be during my summer holiday in addition that it is said to be the best season there .
I will join in the swimming group and the photography group .
Both of them are my hobbies , I have won some prizes in my school competition of them .
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accomodation because I have had all holidays with my parents in luxury hotels before .
As all the travel expenses are paid already , I would appreciate it if you could tell what kind of clothing also how much pocket money I need .
The concert I helped last week was the greatest experience I 've ever had .
You know , although I 'm a pop music fan , I 'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening .
I left the hi - fi system on the left side ( it should be on the other side ) .
Before opening , the pop star found the mistake , otherwise it would be a disaster .
The performer , Paul , is a big music name at the present .
But I 'd never met him before .
I told him I loved his songs , he was very happy .
Then , we stroke a lovely conversation .
Afterwards , he gave his pen for my enthusiasm .
Write soon , tell me how you 're getting on in your new job .
Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show " Over the Rainbow " , thinking that I would have a perfect evening , like its advertisement tell us .
At first I became worried because there was n't any discounts available , like your advertisement say .
And I became even more angry to have to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin .
It 's necessary to start on time , and your paper was informing that it would begin at 19:30 .
To complete my sadness , the main actor was replaced by another one who I 've never heard anything from , and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement do .
It is n't fair not returning the money for a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great , but actually was a shame .
And because of that , everyone at school happened to know that Ali was dating Nick , that used to be Caroline 's boyfriend at the time .
Pat was Ali 's best friend , and because of that , Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline 's boyfriend , but asked her to keep the secret .
Caroline discovered everything , and argued with the infidel couple .
It was a big quarrel , people that were many meters distant could hear it .
Pat entered the fight , and it became more loud and agressive .
One more week has passed , and things became calm : Ali decided to never look Pat on the fact anymore .
They have turned themselves into big enemies .
So , it 's very important to be a person than can keep secrets , even your own secrets , or a friend 's one .
One of the most beautiful things on the world is the true and loyal friendship .
Then , we have to be as best secret keepers as possible , or we will end like Ali and Pat .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which I 've seen on last Saturday .
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed about the show .
I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to drink before I get to the hall so I got there earlier .
It was about fourty five minutes later than original starting time .
I was just a bit upset but I was n't that upset much at that time .
The actor should be Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before .
I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you did n't even mention about that actor was going to change to another guy .
This thing should n't be happened .
After finished watching the show I went to the restaurant which you advertised .
It was about 21:00 , I thought it was bit later but it was n't my falt anyway .
I 'm so upset to say anything anymore and I want to get my money back which I paid for the show .
I look forward to hearing from you before I do my futher reaction .
Your faithfully
Nowadays , we have millions styles of fashion and every single person has their own fashion .
Fashion became a part of our life and some people think that what clothes you wear is most important thing .
We spend lots of time to choose clothes or shoes .
A 100 years ago , people wear much more diffrently .
Women worn dresses and men worn suits in England .
I think people will wear metal clothes like Robotcap .
The enviroment will be very polluted and finally we 'll get desease . We will need helmets to cover our head and we will also need air - supplyer .
May be , science will be developed and make our enviroment clean , we will not wear anything at all ! ! ! ( except under wear ) .
I hope that the enviroment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be .
We should try hard to create new fashion and suitable fashion in further days .
I went the international arts festival which you organized .
You had better invite more nationarities ' people .
And some concert halls were too small , so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films in the next year than this year 's .
Because it does not complex , also we do n't confuse .
If you can improve these points , your festival must be better than this year 's .
Yours faithfully
We are allowed many things .
For example , we can wear any clothes and shoes whatever we want .
And it does n't matter if we enter the classroom in any time .
Of course we can go out the classroom in any time .
But some schools in my country do n't allow many things .
One of the rules of my friend 's school is not to drink and eat something during a class .
And the students have to wear the uniforms , so they ca n't chose their clothes .
It is that I have to come back my house until 11 o'clock at night .
The advertisement promised there would be my favorite star Danny Brook , but there was an other actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook In addition , the performance started 45 minutes later , so we could n't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it had been closed already .
More over , when I was buying our tickets , there were n't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and me are both on pension .
As a result our evening was completely spoiled .
So I am sure you will understand why I so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incindent .
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future to offer me a partly refund .
Two days ago her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to devorce , Maria was so upset that she could n't keep it herself .
Her father had met another woman who had not been as pretty as Maria 's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary .
All fathers things were missing .
They could not believ their eyes .
They read the letter and slowly went onto the kitchen .
Maria bought his favorite food and she throw it away into the bin .
How he could have done it to them ?
She went to skool , but she could not pick the material up as easy as she used to .
Now everyone knows about her sad story that makes her feel even more worse .
I am writing to complain about your music show entitled " Over the Rainbow " Which I saw during my holiday in London .
Firstly , I expected to see the play by Danny Brook who is my favourite actor .
Secondly , according to the advertisement , the show would have started at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
Moreover , the theatre restaurant was closed because of the equipment mentenance .
You should have let us know such information in advance .
Finally , although I heard the student discount ticket was available , the ticket salesman said I should have bought it at least one day before the show .
Therefore , I think you should pay some money back for me .
Please let me know how you think of my complain and request as soon as possible .
I think modern technology has changed my daily life , especially in communication with my best friend who is studying in Britain .
We had seen each other once a week before she left Japan for Britain .
I feel no distance as if I was speaking with a friend in Japan .
Without a computer and a telephone , I could n't contact her easily and I may lose touch with her .
in addittion , I could go tot Britain to see her by plane .
Before the plane was invested , I suppose it might take several months to visit Britain by ship .
In present , it takes just 12 hours by plane .
Thanks to such modern technology , I can improve the relationship with my friend , even if she is living away from me .
I am writing to you to thank you very much for the price you 're giving me .
This is the first time of my life that I won anything like that .
When I recived your latter , I could not belive it .
I am glad to replay your latter .
Unfortunatelly , I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for this dates .
My last holiday in tend I had very bad experience , the mosquitos nearly killed me .
I would prefer log cabins .
I am a lover of risk sports .
I am really good singer .
I am enjoying a lot with karaoke .
I am in doupt which kind of clothes I have to bring with me .
And also ask you , how much money I have to take with me .
Please if you could help me with this I will be very glad .
Your sincerely
I had the best expreience in my live .
I 've to relax myself to expleint to you this very well .
The company I work , works for Los Svaves , it 's a very famous group from my country .
Can you guess whe they chossed for the work , " me " , yes me , I could n't belived it .
At the moment just I went just to one concert .
My job basequily consisted in before and after the actuation , make everything ready .
I 've get used to do it very soon .
To be honnest the most exited part of all this was to know the group .
The singer is very nice gay , as the rest of the group .
If this happen I 'll write you to tell you more .
I am writing you to give you the suitable information you need about me .
but also I would like to thank you for the very nice prize .
Here are some of the information : I would like to travel in July because then the school year ends and I will be able to go on vacation .
I would be very pleased if I could practice basketball and swimming I am very good at basketball and I am playing in my school 's team .
Of course there are some things that I would like to ask you , if possible , I would like to know what kind of clothes shall I take with me .
And finally how much money will I need to have with me .
Thank you again
Yours Sincierly ,
You know that last month I helped at a pop concert and I 've enjoyed it very much .
First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert would take place .
It was amazing ! ( the show )
I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators I even met some very interesting people with who made really good friends .
What I liked the most was working with the singers , teaching them how to dance and follow some footsteps .
This is an experience , I 'll never forget .
First of all , we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three days trip to London .
Indeed , we are especially interested in the sightseeing by bus .
How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city , so famous for it !
Besides , as there are more girls than boys in the class , they would certainly enjoy attending on live make - up and hairstyles .
So , instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon , we might go to the Show .
We may go shopping on Wednesday afternoon , as we should have had freetime .
Yours Faithfully ,
On the one hand , I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention .
The more they are in the media , the more they will be famous .
According to me , some of them need to be appreciated by fans , they need to be loved and see themselves on television .
Besides , I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be , in order to have free advertisement .
Moreover , according to me , it is also a good way for them to earn money .
Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it , either in the newspapers or on television .
In my opinion , it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph .
They can not go to public places , unless they make - up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs .
They would really like a normal life , either because it is their temper , a regarding to their children .
Nevertheless , they are never let alone , which is a shame .
We have to respect them as human beings , what we often forget they are .
Dear Mr Jane Clark
I am writeing to you to " help " you with your festival next year , last year was n't very good so maybe we can make it more atracite this year ?
the first I think we shoul rent biger hall for that so we could make better sound and give more space for viewers !
If we will make one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events we can make intrestede more people .
We can inaute stars and artists from around the world who will make and prisentspresent all kind of music like jazz , rock , classical ect .
It should be done show so people can see how people in every corner of the word make theyr own fun .
Art exhibitions is good idea too , to introdus how the music is making and show how the instruments lode .
Afterward we could let people talk with artists so they can get knoe theyr privacy .
Mr. Jane if you want get more of my suggestions and opinions about it pleace contact with me on my calle phone

Dear Simona !
Thank you for your letter it was so nice to hear from you gain and I am glad you have meant this subject .
It 's believed that English schools look different and have different rules then Polish schools but may be we might find sth incomon ? !
The first of all it dipends what kind of school it is ?
Primary , highschool or university ! I think that now Polish schools are going foward but they still have lots of bad habits .
Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have less pracite lessons , sometimes it 's hard to get a books or other neaded things to study .
Conneat between students and their teachers or principals is very poor !
During the lesson we are not allowed to have food or stg drink , we ca n't be late to school
School supose to be our second home but it 's not we work hard and for the end our education we still have nothing .
You asking me what would I change ?
I would make schools more unstressfull , added fun cause it 's easeyer way to learn and I would gives students more chances to share yo with their fantazy at school .
Maybe Polish system is not bad , but it 's conftyble too .
I know that that letter will not change anything but you can see how compliated is Polish studen 's life
Your
Dear , Helen
I was very please when I knew that I had won the first prize .
For accommodation I would rather prefer log cabins because it 's more comfortable than tents .
For two activities , the first one can I have Tennis , please .
Because I 'm very good with tennis .
The second one can I have Photography , please .
Because this 's my hobby .
So this 's will be my first chance that I can use it .
Can you tell me what sort of clothes do I need to bring , please .
I 'm not sure about the weather in California in the daytime and in the nightime .
And any idea of how much money do I need to bring .
Thank you very much for your offerring .
I hope to hear back from you .
Thanks for the letter asking about a pop concert .
My responsibilities are selling the tickets and making sure that everything is right .
It was good to work with a lot of people and shared experiences .
I would feel sad if I did n't go there .
They gave me a concert printed T - shirt .
I 'll show you by photographs .
From that time I had a lot of friends also some of them are old friends from college .
So we are still keep in touch .
And next concert we were promised we 'll be there again .
I wish you were there with us .
Because sometimes you would n't have known the experience until you had done it .
Any way I will sent you some photographs .
Please send my love to your family .
I am writing this letter to remind you some faults of your theatre .
From my point of view , your organisation has to be careful to orginize an activity .
I attended to your activity .
I 'm sorry but I did n't have a good remark of your activity when I left .
That 's why I wanted to write you .
First time , when I saw the advertisement on the newspaper , I really appreciated .
Coming an hour earlier is the proof of my feeling .
Because , I believe that if you want to get a satisfaction you have to sacrifice a little bit .
But it was n't all .
On the other hand , I could n't see the same actors whose name were written on the advertisement . I was really shocked .
Because from my point of view the buildings of a play are the actors .
It was unpleasent for me to see different actors on the stage .
In addition , you did n't keep your promise which
That 's why she came across with so many problems .
Beatrice was thinking so .
When she came to school , first , we wanted to warn her .
On the other hand Beatrice and her family were our next door neighbours .
Her father never let her to have a boyfriend .
Yes , it was a strange behaviour .
One day Beatrice came me with some tears on her face .
I could n't believe .
Because I got used to seeing her every time cheerful and laughing .
But this time the situation was inversed .
She asked if we spoke a little bit .
She had told Pat that her father had n't let them to be friends anymore .
After that , Pat had told everyone that Beatrice 's father
I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment about your theatre .
On the advertisement , that I have received , it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept wainting for it to start for half an hour .
And there were no discounts available either , unlike it was written in the same advertisement .
Another disappointing point was that I wanted to watch Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show , but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him .
Because of all these reasons , which I have listed above , my evening which should have been perfect , turned into a disaster .
Yours sincerely ,
And now the situation was becoming harder to get on with .
On one side it was her best friend who wanted her to keep this secret .
But on the other side it was her best friend 's family , that she must lie to .
Her best friend was going out with a boy that night , And she told her parents that she was going to stay at Pat 's house , in order to get permission .
She did not trust the boy , and it was very hard for her to lie to people , that she liked so much .
And she realized that if something happens to her best fried , it would be her fault and her best friend 's parents would blame her for it .
Of course , her best friend would never trust her again and never share any secrets , but she was doing this for her best friends sake , was n't she ?
I am writing to you about my complaints of mine about the musical show of your theater , that I have watched a week ago , during my stay in London .
That evening , the problems started with the tickets ... On the contrary with the advertisement , that was published on the Guardian , there were no discounts available , although I had an International Student Identity card .
Secondly , the show has started with a delay of 45 minutes , and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed .
Another problem was the starring male actor : the well known and talented actor , mentioned in the advertisement was replaced with another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theater restaurant , which was said to be open and available for meals after the show ; but it was closed .
I think you owe me an excuse and a full refund .
I 'm looking forward to hear from you .
Have we ever seen a naked person in the streets ?
Except some very extraordinary cases , no .
Tell me , why people care so much about what they wear and what others wear ?
Because , the clothes have a crucial part in our everyday lives .
Maybe because of this , just like living things , the clothes have evolution .
How about the clothes of people , a hundred years later ?
In my opinion the clothes of the world , after a century , will be styled in the Japanese way : minimalist and naturalist .
Throughout the history , we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural , such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be " out " .
Of course , the technology will change too .
Maybe , new kinds of fabrics , that are capable of insulating light , or heat will be used .
Actually , some clothes like that are being developed today ; but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future .
Finally , it seems to me that , the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalist and minimalist and also , the fabrics that are used will change too .
In fact , we can not know , what will the time give and take away , so let 's wait and see : the clothes of the future .
I appriciated to this big news .
Because my college will finish in the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August .
Second , I prefer to stay a log cabin .
I usually stay a tent during camping .
Actually , I do n't like tent so much .
Therefore , I am interested in staying a log cabin .
I learned painting when I was school student .
Specially , I like water painting .
Also , I belonged to golf club when I went to university in Japan .
Finally , I would like you to advise about clothes and pocket money , which I will take . Thanking you for your time .
Especially , I prefer to go department stores . They are heaven ! I can spend in there all day .
In fact , they have many kind of products which make me happy .
To be honest , I do n't always buy these products but I can be satisfied with just looking them .
Some people does n't like to go shopping with a friend who takes long time to decide .
I believe there are lot of why to enjoy shopping .
I think many people , specially women , had same experience .
But the most important things to enjoy shopping is not to use every money which you have .
It really took me by surprise this prize , I did n't think I would be so lucky to win .
First of all , about your enquires , the only time suitable for me to travel is in July .
The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefor I need to be here .
Secondly , I would rather stay in a tent , there 's no further reason is just that would be a new experience for me and I 'm very excited about it .
I am very keen on photography so I definetely will choose this as one of my activities during the camp .
I have got some experience already and I 'm used to any weather conditions , furthermore I simply love sea - sports and their chalenges .
Finally I 'd like to ask you some questions , there are mainly small details .
I am not sure whether I will need some special clothes , if not what sort of clothes I should bring , and also how much money roughly I will need for my daily expenses . I would be very grateful for your help and advice in this matters .
My dear friend I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am . You must remember me telling you about the pop concert , well now that it 's over I have time to tell you everything about it .
The concert was a huge success , lots of people came and enjoyed the music .
Especially when the musicians arrived , they can be very demanding people and sometimes they came up with very odd requests .
For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label , which was impossible to get .
My tasks were very especifics .
I had to help with the layout of the stage , which was very complicated , because there are so many cables , and weir and things going on at the same time .
After that part was fully - functioning I moved on to work in the back stage .
I really enjoyed working with those people , they are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes .
However , what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing , jumping and enjoying frenetically of something that I had been part of and helped to make it happened .
I was spending some days in London and enjoyed a lot the idea of seeing this show .
All my disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets , but as we wanted to see Danny Brook 's performance , we decided to buy them anyway .
We got really upset when we realized he was being substituted .
Besides the boredom of having waited for forty - five minutes , we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show , since it was already closed by the time the show finished .
As it was not our perfect evening out , as you suggested in your advertisement , we would like to know if it would be possible for us to get a refund .
Its name is " Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " , and I really got impressioned with the coherence of the stories .
Agatha Christie presents situations that make us break up our minds .
The crimes she describes seem so perfect that we brainstorm a lot trying to find out who is the criminal .
I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place in a Detective course .
Agatha Christies stories are simple , but very well written , and , as I told you , very coherent .
It 's estimulating to read them .
I 'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately , and find out there many challenges for your new carreer .
I would like to congratulate you for the excellent programme that you have prepared .
I think that is such a good programme especially because the places that we visit , like the Science Museum , are very interesting .
However , the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London where the latest fashions will be shown .
There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles , too .
And it has free - entrance for the students .
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while our visit to London , the 14th of March .
We think that , if you do n't have any problem , we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show .
We are wating for your decision and we will accept it whatever it be .
From any point of view , the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today .
I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that , for example , we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa .
Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an UFO , in my opinion the changes wo n't be very important , they will probably consist on making the houseworks easier .
The cleanest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our house Both are very similar but now we have new technologies .
In balance then , I think that the houses that we can see on films wo n't really exist .
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip .
I would like to go to the trip in July because my school , which is Berkeley International School , is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students .
Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold .
The weather condition will be suitable for camping .
I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature .
Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent .
Although , living in the tent is more comfortable .
I 'll have to be aware about insects so I 've bought so many insects repellant .
I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and swimming .
When I was in fourth form , I got the first prize in swimming competition and third prize in tennis .
I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price .
Lastly , I would like to ask you questions .
And do I have to bring some money .
It will be very kind of you , if you can answer my questions .
Your sincerely ,
How are you .
I have an interesting story to tell you . I 've been asked to help by the well known band called Westlife .
At first I was surprised but in a few secound later , when I relised that , I did n't allow to go , I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go .
At last , she allowed me .
I had to help them behind the state , while they were get dressed .
I had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones was working properly .
Although the work was not heavey , I gained a lot of experience .
They gave me their signature and when the concert started , they told me to come up on the state and dance with them .
I was really embarassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that is the very good experience I have ever had .
I was really enjoy at the concert .
Thing that I particularly like in the concert is I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert which is another well known band .
Tell me yoors . I want to know what experience you 've had when you were in England .
I am writing to you inconnection with your programme of spending three days in London .
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March at 10.00 - 19.00 .
I would be greatful if you could arrange these shows in your programme .
It is very thoughtful of you that you are taking all of us to London .
This is great oppotunity for me to explore and experience London myself especially , The London fashion and leisure shows .
Most of the shows are about fashinable things for the students in my age .
I think it is a good programme and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of the shows for instance latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , how to make up and how to have propiate hairstyles .
In my opionion , I think you should organised this programme in the afternoon instead of going for shopping and move the shoping time in the afternoon on Wednesday .
I hope this information will help you to understand and put it in your programme .
I trust you to pay immidiate attention to my suggestions .
Yours sincerily ,
I closed my eyes , tooke a deep breath and jumed out of the tower .
There were hundrend of Thai students were waiting for doing this test .
I was very afraid of the hieght and was very nervous .
I was given the lists for doing the activities while I was going to the adventurous school schems at the solder camps in the north of Thailand .
There were many tasks that I had to complete for instance , clime up to the mountain , how to used some kind of guns , and how to survive when I got lost in the forest .
The last task I had to do was jume out of the hight tower .
The assistants were the real solder and they were very kind and helpful eventhough , they looked very strick and unkind .
It was the hardest time for me to do thing like this because I lived in the city most of my life I had never known about how to survive in the forest and how difficult to work as solders .
I eventaully managed to complete all tasks that I had given I was very proud of this .
I think I would like to travel only on July because I 've just finished my course at that time , and I can have a short holidays in these days .
Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins , I think I prefer both of them , because I 've never been there before , and never heard of these two places .
I am very interested in both places but , I can just choose one place , I think I will choose log cabins , it 's sounds good and if I have time , maybe I can go to tents next time ( maybe next year . )
When I am at Camp , I will choose singing and photography I can sing classic music and pop music , seem like rock & roll .
My mum liked me singing this song .
And I can also make very good photography , because I learned this in China two years ago .
Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about journey , What 's the weather like ?
What kind of clothes shall I take ? and how much does it cost per night live in a Hotel ?
A lot of people enjoy shopping very much , me too .
Firstly , I am a student , I do n't have job , so , I have to asked money from my parents .
I ca n't asked too much that 's very bad for my parents .
When I go shopping .
I alway feel shame because I spend my parents money .
( although I got part - time job , it just enough to pay my rent . )
Secondly , if you live in a big city , the things always expensive .
You should spend more money on buying clothes and food , you will very happy when you buy it , but , when you come back home take out you purse , you must be feel sad , you purse nearly empty , ( when you do n't have enough money . )
Sometimes , when you shopping on the street , you will see a lot of things that you like , and you ca n't buy it once , you will feel very sad maybe .
And then , you may save money for the things you like , nothing to do , just for the poor things what you like so funny is n't it ?
Another thing is when you shopping in a busy street , seem like oxford st in London . a lot of thief there , they will steal you money , that 's so dangerous .
It will stop when I get a good job .
I am writing this letter to you to show the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and the real life .
When I saw your advertisement on yesterday 's newspaper , I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement .
I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose seeing Over The Rainbow , but I did n't even see him on the stage .
Moreover it was written that the musical was between 14:30 - 19:30 .
Suprisingly the show started at 20:15 .
Then I decided to have a dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show , but unfortunately it was closed .
I think , all of these disappointments are too much for one evening .
After all I am sure that you understood it was n't my perfect evening out and you will give my money back .
I am looking forward to hearing your good news
Sincerely ,
That was also my fault . I do n't know why I told this to Pat .
Yesterday Larry suggested going to cinema after school .
Going to cinema with the boy I love .
Of course I accepted immidiately .
I was like walking on the clouds the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me .
I suddenly remembered that I promised Pat to help her with her history homework .
She came near to me and said " Ready for this evening ?
Do n't forget bringing your history books . "
I told her that I want to tell her something .
Then I explained what has happened that morning .
She was about to cry .
" I see . You choose Larry , but I thought that I was your best friend . "
I told her not to tell this anyone .
After school Larry and I went to the cinema , but on the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us .
When they asked me the reason I told that I promised my Mom to be with her .
When I closed my bedroom 's door I burst into tears .
Everyone at the school was knowing about my love to Larry including him .
Pat was the only person who knew it .
I 'm very surprise , to won this prize .
About the information , I like to travel on July because it 's only the month I have vacation .
About the accommodation at Camp California I will prefer tents because I like the nature and I like to listen the birds .
At the camp I will like to practise tennis and golf .
My level in this two activities is medium , I never practise them all .
I would like to ask you some question .
How many money take us ? or is necessary ?
What can of clothes met it ?
In the first prize you including a second person like my husband ?
It 's necessary for the activities to wear special clothes ?
Thank you another time for this first prize two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I 'm very happy .
When we arrived to the shopping center , I saw a lot of people .
I do n't understand why they was a lot of people .
My friends and I , I went to a fashion shop " Mango " to buy some clothes .
Nobody at the shop came with us to help .
There are four gays , in this shop .
We asked them if someone of them help us .
Finally , a girl very friendly came with us .
My friends bought some things like a red trousers and white tee - shirts .
But not always it 's the same history because I like shopping and I think I 'm enjoy .
Not all the time the people are not friendly in the shops .
I , as a head member of the students who participate in this year 's trip to London , would like to thank you for the excellence of the programme you have developed for us .
Specially , I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries all around the world .
Being London one of the most multicultural , multiracial cities , we can not avoid the fact that is these days The London Fashion And Leisure Show takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall ( Tuesday March 14th ) 10:00 - 19:00 . ) .
Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes in the fabulous Programme you have offered .
These changes will not affect the contacts of the programme itself .
I also would like to remark that this change does not increment the cost of the trip , because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students .
I want to thank you Sir for your time .
" Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger is knocking at your door every day .
It was 20 years ago we were friends since 10 .
In those days we decide to be friends forever and work for the NASA .
Of course we had n't got enough points in the test to do it so .
So , that , we decide to access our school Main database and change our test results .
This way we could obtain seldom places at NASA university .
The task was not easy , with 18 you do n't know too much about cryptographic algoritms and databases but anyway we decided to do it there was nothing to lose .
Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure system and new encryptation algorithms .
I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days , during our stay in London , and would like to thank you .
As we have been told , there are a lot of interesting paintings and ancient sculptures in which we all are keen to see it .
A couple of days ago , my classmates made the suggestion , that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London , Central Exhibition Hall , which was advertised in a school magazine and there is free entry for students .
The show includes the latest fashion wear , sports wear for spare time , make up and hairstyles .
We agreed in the class to visit this show on Tuesday 14 March in the afternoon after lunch instead of shopping .
We would be grateful , if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hearing from you soon .
In my opinion , most of these people are aware of the consequences like not to have a " private life " anymore .
As soon as they are famous , they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place .
I can imagine , how annoying it can be sometimes .
Just think that you 'd like to go shopping , clubbing or to a restaurant with friends .
There 's really no way to be together just only with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these paparazzis .
It is the way how they earn money , of course .
But on the other hand I have to mention that they are going too far sometimes to take a picture .
For example Lady Diana . Do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend had n't been followed by these nosy paparazzis ?
Well , this will be an open question to anyone .
I am amazed with the prize in your competition .
I am looking forward to go to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information .
About accommodation , I would prefer to stay in tents because it will be a new experience for me .
I like to get new experiences specially when I am on holiday .
I am pleasant to have the opportunity to practice sports as well .
Will the Camp California provide the clothes for swimming and play tennis ?
In my opinion shopping is a very good practice that 's give you more opportunity to enjoy yourself .
I do n't understand why men do n't like shopping at least they say that .
Despite the fact that it love shopping I have to agree that it is not " always " enjoyable .
It 's boring .
You should n't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because its so boring .
Another point is now you do n't need to go out just for shopping .
You can buy a lot of products by Internet .
In conclusion I think there is boring time and enjoyable time when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring time .
During my stay in your city , I had the opportunity to assist to your show named ' Over the rainbow ' after having read an advertisement in the magazine ' Going - out ' of the 1st of June .
The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre : my 6 year old son had to pay full price .
Then , even if we could enter in the room , the show did n't start before 20:15 , which is 45 minutes later than expects .
Indeed , we are still waiting on Danny Brook who was not in the piece .
And last , at the end of the program , we would like to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant , but it was already closed due to the poor attendance .
As this evening was for my family and I a wasted one , I permit myself to ask you for refund .
There is no need to be a genious to notice that technology has evoluated so considerably during the last decades that our everyday life has changed .
From my point of view , modern technology has first permit to me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer .
In this domain , you have to afford everyday the development of new technology .
The advantage of this is that you need to interest yourself in all if you do n't want to be put on the side .
And so , your life is not boring at all as you learn new things everyday .
In the other hand , you can not stay quiet for 2 week as some new inventions come out every day .
Finally , new technology have a great influence on my life as it permits me to live on .
But , who knows , may be one day I will develop technology that will send me right to the unemployment office !
i was so happy when i knew that i won first prize in your competition .
i 'm hope that it will be good gift for me from your organization .
You asked me when i like to travel ?
i like to travel . only in July because in august i must go to my grandmother and help to her to gather a harvest of fruits .
i 'd prefer take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting spend nights in the tent . and with the tent i can go to enougher place of the camp .
But when it is going to rain it is not comfortable , but I like it .
i 'm want to do such activities likes basketball .
Because i think it is teenagers game .
and i 'm like painting because i like to paint the nature , sea , moutains .
i 'm often go to an exhibitions of paintings of modern artists .
But i like different stiles of art . i 'd think I 'll enjoy this travel .
i whant to know some questions about it .
Can i say more then two weeks if i like it ?
In what day i can start my travel ? in what conditions it will be spend ? and the last one .
How much money i should take there ?
i 'm realy lookind forward for your answers . and i hope to see you soon .
yours sencerely Gubin .
i 'm absolutly agree with it .
Because i have my own expirience of shopping .
For exsample resently i was shopping at the market , which located in the center of our town .
end what do you think ?
When i was there i saw very beatiful T - shirt .
i asked my mother to buy it .
But my mother said : " i haven't enough money to buy it " .
i was abset of it .
Our goverment very burocrative .
Our ministers very criminal they are often breake the law , stole money .
for example Paul Kozin had stole 800000000 dollars .
Because of it our stare ca n't pay money to workers of schools , hospetols , builders . in our country high nomber unemploeers .
Usual people ca n't buy a piece of bread . and they ask for money to enougher people .
my parents ca n't buy me all what i want our society our full .
each man think only about himself .
quality of life very low .
But i hope that i will be time when each person can buy to himself everything that he or she want . and shoppings will be allways enjoyable .
I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won , in which you required some additional information .
I am very happy to have won a two - week trip at Camp California , but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work .
As I am an expert camper , I would prefer to be accommodated in tents than in log cabins .
What concerns activities at the camp , I would be highly delighted if I could play basketball and tennis .
The former because I am an excellent basketball - player and the latter because I am interested in taking up a new sport as I am a complete beginner at it .
I am a little unsure about some things and I would be very grateful to you if you could answer my questions . I would like to know if I will need to take some special clothes and how much money would be suitable to bring with .
After our English class ' decision to make a short film about daily life in my school , I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed .
Therefore , to show the good aspects , I suggest to film Mr. Clark 's English classes , because they are highly educative and because the students participate a lot .
On the other hand , to show less pleasing aspects , it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison 's French classes , as they are extremely boring and sub - standard .
One event that should not be missed to film , is the weekly football game between teachers and students , which shows how well they get along with each other .
Another event that should absolutely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen .
In conclusion , I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video . Because the above mentioned events are the most praised or criticised ones by all students .
I have just seen the letter this morning and I am very happy for win the competition .
I believe I have the appropriate qualification to stay two weeks at camp California .
It could be wonderful to see you as soon as possible .
First of all , I will be able to travel in July because I have not finished school .
Althoug I wich that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in tents .
I get experience in the last summer .
Secondly , I am very keen at sports .
Specially at sailing and swimming .
Anyway I am hard working for the word cup at sailing .
Finally , I would like to know how is the weather in July ?
Because I have to prepare all my staf and I am sure it would be a great experience despite the cost of living .
I look forward to hearing for you .
Thank you for my birthday 's present .
Sorry about my last mail but I 've been traveled .
I did n't tell you about my last job , you remember last moth I 've helped at a pop concert .
Anyway , it was fantastic you ca n't imagine how was the concert like ?
However , I was responsible for check in for the entrance then I must gave a sit to everyone .
Anyway I enjoed so much .
I haven't been to a concert before so the atmosphier was really good .
I should n't forgot my experience in my life .
Did you remember the computer curse that we took together it was very useful to clasifay each person in the concert .
A lot of love ,
You had picked up unknown but talented directors ' films and they were really worth watching .
Especially , I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore .
However , I found some things which I think I should point out .
Some concert halls were not big enough to have the audience .
For next year , I think you should take this matter into consideration , And I think it would be much better if you had more plays and films .
To make it more enjoyable , I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments on it .
A Japanese folk story " a bamboo princess "
One day , the lady went to a river to wash clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees .
In a bamboo forest , he found a shining bamboo .
She was named bamboo princess .
The princess grew up beautifully .
Some princes proposed her .
But she said to them , " if you want me , you have to do this . " and asked them to do impossible things because she did n't want to get married .
When they asked her , she said " I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon " .
But , one the day , the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her .
I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to apreciate the travel I won .
To be honest , the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only in the end of June .
As an accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been doing camping for years and enjoy it very much .
As I have a chance to do 2 activities while I am at the Camp , I will choose singing which I am very good at and swimming which I am fond of but unfortunately , not a professional .
In the end I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also the sum of money I will need ... during my vacation .
A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men of the world would never believe that in my opinion , shopping is really not always enjoyable .
Especially , I ca n't support to do shopping with my mother : it takes so much time that later I regret of agreeing to go with .
When I am on my own , everything is fine : I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours to choose what I really want either for myself or someone else .
Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way to do it .
Some go just to kill the time others - to look at something new , I am in the third group - previously I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need .
But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day looking for my mother in a huge department - store .
I see your advertisement about Internal Arts Festival now . I think that 's a great idea .
As we need some good activities . Advertisement is written that you invite stars and artist from around the world .
This is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote .
I think you should invite from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world .
If you invite from more countries to stars and artist , your festival will be unbelieved .
Second point is there are some jazz , rock and classical concerts .
Because of these , people are bored quickly .
I congradulate you because it 's perfect .
The most important thing is dance shows .
As more people like dance shows , me too .
That 's the real knowledge for us , art exhibition and talks by writers .
I think we know a writer life or how is he writing it ?
it 's very significant thing .
Lastly , you said ' one reasonable - priced weekend ticket for all events ' .
If you can pay attention to my small suggestion , next year I hope it will be unbelievable festival .
I miss you very much and sorry about did n't write you some letters .
What are you dong today , how is your school ?
However ; today I used to my school , I have got two sweet girls .
But this school has got a lot of rules and in our class , we have been talking about Rules , both at home and at school .
For instance ; you must not argue with your friend or you must not argue with workers .
I feel very bad because what you are allowed I are n't allowed to do at home .
Are you understand me ?
Please you will write me a letter quickly .
Lovers !
I am writing to you because of the musical show " Over The Rainbow " I saw in your theatre last week .
I looked forward a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had .
Firstly , you did not tell the truth about starring .
The advertisement of the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook , unfortunately there was someone else - an actor which I do not like and if I have known that he was going to be I woud not have come to see him .
Secondly , it was supposed to start at 19.30 but actually started at 20.15 .
Forty five minutes later !
You also have mentioned about the discounts and there were not any .
Lastly , the restaurant which was going to be opened was in fact closed without a reason !
Keeping in mind all these arguments , I want to ask you for some money back .
I think it could be your nice apologise for all my problems and disappointments .
Your faithfuly ,
Contemporary modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives .
It affects our lifes , my too .
In fact modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when I was born , so I can not say that it changed my life rapidly .
But I am also sure , that my life would be different without it .
All these products of science are with me since the very beging of my day .
For example I am woken up by my electronic alarm - clock , then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water , next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio .
All these things are the ideas of the technology .
On the other hand , I am aware of all these disadvantages of the modern technology ; pollution and dangarous it brings .
But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary - the age of modern science .
Finally , I think that we can not talk only about changes which the modern technology has brought to our lives .
That 's because that I think that we are the one who change the technology as well .
I think that our lives are lives with technology , they sometimes mean the same as science and affects not on at each other but together .
So how has the modern technology changed my daily life ?
I do n't know how it would be like without the technology .
I am writing to answer about your invitation which I have receved as a first winner .
I am very delighted to visit the two weeks Camp California in the U.S.A ..
This would be an ideal opportunity for me to visit the United States to learn the American way of life .
First of all , I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment , so my boss said I can have my travel - holiday only on July .
Secondly , I 'd like to prefer to stay in tents , that would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California .
And I would like to choose my activities Golf and painting .
I used to play Golf several years and I like to paint the composition .
Last , I have no experience in abroad .
Therefore I 'd like to know about the weather in California on July .
May be there are some occasions which I have to pay myself .
As above mentioned , please take care to give me more information , and if you 'd like to know more , please telephone me for further discussion .
Many people are saying : " When you have a son , send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance at the best opportunity .
There are all kinds of facilities what you can imagine .
Most of the people , they like to go to centre of City that 's Meong - Dong where is the uderground acade and several businesses have their head quarter there .
There are also many kinds of take - away restaurants , where I can taste my favorite foods .
If I go to visit my family in Korea , I usually walk along the Meong - Dong streets , and am enjoying to have eye - shopping .
But there are alwalys a lot of traffic at all times , and the air is so polluted that I ca n't even breathe .
I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfrendly people who are too busy .
First of all , I am writing to thank you for organising school 's trip to London .
However , the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , which is going to take place on 14th of March at Central Exhibition Hall .
Visitors will be able to see the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear and also get some help with make up or hairstyle .
It would be great opportunity to see this show , because we are all very interested in fashion subject .
What is more , admittion for students is free .
In our opinion we could join the show on Tuesday , after visiting the Science Museum .
Your sincerely ,
In these days , when we can see picture of famous person almost on every first page of the newspaper , it 's a quite common topic .
First of all , I think that famous people deserve to have private life .
Journalists should not follow them all the time , trying to make an interview or taking an ' interesting ' picture .
I think that deep inside famous persons are just ordinary people and like for all of us having a private life is important for psychological condition .
On the other hand , we could say that they decided to have such kind of life .
However , everyone needs to have some part of his life being a secret .
I am writing to your about the trip in London .
Thanks for your programme , we are all looking forwards especially for the Monday 13 March because we will discover all the monument in London .
However , we have got a suggestion : we saw an advertissement for " the London Fashion and Leisure Show " which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00 .
For all of us , it sound like a great opportunity because we though that this event would makes us learn about the way of life in London , the english style ....
Our request is to change the programme , either you can cancel all the Tuesday and we can enjoy all the exhibition or if you can not cancel the Museum , we can go there right after because we will have full of time to shopping during our free time on Wednesday .
Hoping that you will think about it carefully because we are all very exciting .
Yours Faithfully
Since always , medias has been keen of famous people life and it 's becoming worst and worst , you can find everything in " gossip " Newspapers .
Does famous people deserve to keep their own life secret ?
According to me , you ca n't deserve to have a private life when you 're famous because when to start you career you know that medias will be hunting you everywhere and more famous you get worst it is going to be because that the life style people wants to know everything , for instance , about their favourite actor or about their president .. they saw them many time on T.V. or Cinema ,
And famous people like it because if you 're a star or whatever it 's because you like to show yourself .
therefore , even if I agree sometimes Medias are going too far and write really bad things .
if you 're famous you can not have private life because all of this is a part of their job .
And if Medias are too awful they have got law to protect themself .
I was pleased to recieve you letter ricently .
Now I 'm going to give you some information , you asted about .
I 'm sory to tell that , but the only time I will be able to take this trip in July , according to our team 's shudule .
The next thing - I would prefer to spend all nights in tent , so I can move it to the place will better suite me . - I like to wake up with a view to mountains , wich remind me about my 5 years experience in climbing .
I made two albums about birds and flowers life .
So , is it posible , I would like to continue doing my favorite hobbies in the Camp .
Do I need to bring any special clothes or gize ?
Shoping is not always enjoyable
If you need something you have a choice to borrow it from friends or library , or to bye it .
Let 's speak about shoping .
As in all there are some advantages and disadvantages .
Do you think it 's enjoyable spending of time ?
If you would ask me , I prefer my friends to do all shoping for me .
Because I aware of big lines to check point , crowds of people , noise ...
And of'course not all shops have good conditionering .
In my opinion the better time for shoping is weekdays , preferably in the morning .
Otherwise , you either will not find what you are looking for , or you will , and spend the rest of the day in bad mood , because of bad maners of sales people , that not every time you ask can give you any advice .
It can be boring , it can be not .
Summerise all , I will recomend to spend less time indoors , shopping during the weakdays .
But everything was terrible and different from your advertisement .
You wrote ' discouts available ' but they did n't discount .
You advertised for my perfect evening out .
But I was unpleasent because of these things .
I think there is nothing not to be influenced by science and technology affects in our daily life nowadays .
I would like to answer how modern technology has changed my daily life as a housewife .
I have much housework to be done from early morning until late evening .
I always use many electric products ; washing machine , dish - washer , vacuum cleaner , blender , juice , fridge .
I think I can have my spare time owing to these thing .
For example if I do n't have washing machine , I will have to wash all clothes myself .
During the washing machine is whirring , I can get my time .
Also I ca n't imagine my life without car .
Owing to all of them , I can live very comfortbly .
These things provide me all convenience .
I am writing to you because I receive your letter concerning the prize of two weeks in California that I have won .
I would like to travel the first two weeks of July because in June I will be working and at the end of July I am planing to go to Paris to attend a course of French .
I would prefer to be accomodated in tents because I love camping but I do n't mind also the second possibility .
In your letter you wrote that I will I the chance to do two activities ; First of all I would like to play tennis because I have been plaing for seven years , secondly I would like to attend a course of surf but I have just some elementary knowledge .
I would like also to have more information about the cost and which kind of clothes you suggest to bring with me .
I am looking forward your reply
Your faithfully
First of all I would like to say that I think it is important to concentrate this video in few but interesting part of our daily life at school
Interesting will be to show how the lessons are organize , saing that we are never doing just one activitie during the class .
We should speak about our library that it is well furnished of several books , tape and video .
After that we have to make sure that we explain how is it the relationship betwen teachers and students , showing the several time that we have been out together .
In addition I think should be reported in this video some personal opinion about the school asking students and teachers .
Finaly we should give some information also about our courses concerning tourism , buisness and computer .
thank you very much for your letter .
It is great that I could win the first prize in your competition , which means that I will have the possibility to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am sure it will be an exciting experience for me .
As request following you will find the information you need .
First , I would like to travel in July because my company is going to close for holiday at that period and it would suits me very well .
Secondly , I would prefer an accomodation in tent because I enjyoi being outside close to the nature .
Thirdly , what the activities concern , which I can choose , it is a little bit difficult to decide because I would like to try all of them !
I have won various little tennis tournaments in my country and abroad .
and I am able to swim every style .
Please let me know which clothes do I need then and how much money in cash and as travellers cheque shall I take with me .
Sometimes the bad charachters in a story are more interesting than the good ones .
Recently I have red a short story written by Agatha Christie .
His title was : " The Mistery of Hunter 's Lodge " .
The charachter which I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering , the mistress .
It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people : herself and the houskeeper .
Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it .
I think that her husband only followed what she ordered him .
She was the head in this story .
The plan was almost perfectly and the police had n't discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot .
In my opinion Mrs. Havering was a extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense .
Moreover she must have had an " ice blood " and strong nerves to handle in that way .
As far as I am concerned I would appreciate to have myself some of her characteristics , like take a decision and handle .
I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called " Over the Rainbow " , and I was very disappointed after it .
First off all I would like to say that it has started later than it should to , I had to wait for about fourty - five minutes .
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show which was very disappoiting for me because I like this actor very much , and I think that I was not the only one who was upset .
Another disappointing thing was that that discounts were not available , which made me a bit angry .
I think that the most disappointing think was that theatre 's restaurant was closed . I would to add that I was hungry after the show .
I would rather say that it was a very disappointing evening , and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet at court !
Yours sincerlly ,
First off all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much .
Every day when I get up I am checking if there are any messages left for me like e - mail or SMS in my mobile phone .
They are very usefull things which sometimes are nessecary to survive .
Modern technology has got a big influence on our life .
It is easier . We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones which are the best things ever made .
I watch about four hourers TV a day , I even eat my meals in front of the TV . We can see PEOPLE 'S LIFE in other countries which is very interesting for me and my friends .
Also Iternet has influence on my daily life , beause I can find there many interesting things , or I can meet with people from all over the world which is exciting for me .
I think that life with out modern technology would be simple and borring that 's why I am using it in my daily life , I am happy that there is such thing as modern technology .
Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to stay in the Camp California
Secondly , I will be able to travel on July because I am a manager so I can not travel another time .
I would like to sing and photograph , I 've done a course about photography and I think that I am very good on it .
In the other hand , I can not sing very well but I would like to do this there .
I would like to know which type of clothes I will wear there , would you check the weather forecast for me , please ?
And how much money I am going to need to have there with me ?
A long time ago , when I started working , I received my first pay and went to a shopping center to spend my money with my credit card .
Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrives and where was my money ?
I started to look in everywhere .
I 've asked my mom and my friends and everybody did n't know where it was .
' You 've told me that you were going to put it in your wallet . '
I started to look for my wallet and I could n't find it , lighter .
It was and old woman asking who was Maria .
' It 's me ! ' I said .
That 's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the sit of the eating - place of the shopping center that I went that day !
All the students are happy that we will have othe oppurtinatey , to visit London for three days .
This trip would gives us the change to see London and to improve the english language .
We all agree to the daily programme during the three days .
In the morning , we will have the change , to see some of the sightseeings of London by bus , For example the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery .
In the afternoon , the River trip to Greenwich would also be a fantastic experience for us .
The reason I write to you , is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , for a fiew days .
It would be exciting , if we had the possibility , to go to the show .
The show includes the latest fashions in the sports clothing and the most fashionable make up and hairstyles .
We all think that the London fashion and Leisure show will be a great opportunity for us .
The show is free for students and we can see the show instat of having free time Wednesday in the afternoon .
Ourdays , with the help of the media famous people , like a politician or filmstars , plays an important rule in our community .
It is also normally , that the journalists are after them .
They want to get from them all the details of their life , especially from their private .
Who got married , who got divorsed or who had a remarkeable changing of his complexion , these are questions , who most journalists are interested in .
But what life is it , when you even ca n't go to a restaurant being afraid of , the journalists , will be waiting outside for you ?
Famous people diserve also to have a private life .
It is a right like everybody from us has .
Is it normally when you are a star , that everybody wants to know all about you .
We shoudn't forget , that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media !
I think nobody have forgotten , where curiosity from the journalists end .
For example the hunting about Princess Diana and his friend .
I hope that they will punished for what they done !
I am writing to complain about a musical show called ' Over the rainbow , that took place in the Circle Theatre .
There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisment .
In the advertisment it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play main roles .
The advertisment said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
I was waiting for the show for a half - an - hour !
The third problem were the discounts .
The advertisment said that they would be available but they were not .
It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show , but unfortunatelly it was closed .
To conclude , I am not satisfied with the show I watched in your theatre and I would like a fully refund .
But the most developed creature is a human .
He lived nearly 10 000 years .
During this time men had developed and now are the leading creatures .
They built huge cities , destroyed forests , got into space .
The modern technology , on the one hand , made our life easier .
We use different electric kettle .
We build big cities , there are hot and cold water , electricity , gas in particulary every home .
We use different transport that makes our moving faster , it fastens our life .
We communicate with other people by telephone , mail , we read newspapers , we watch television , get different information from internet .
But , on the other hand modern technology destroyed our life .
Factories polluted the air we breath , shops polluted the water we drink .
Many different uncureable diseases appeared .
For example : cancer occured in Africa after American nuclear tests
All in all , technology made our life better by destroying the environment .
In future possibly the technology would n't destroy the environment , but we have to do something now , because tomorrow can be too late .
I am writing to reply your letter in which you let me know I had won the first prize in your competition .
I would like to travel in July as it is the only month in this year when I do not have any exams .
For accommodation I would prefer a tent , as I love nature and I like going camping a lot .
About the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball .
I have only practised it once .
But , on the other side , I am a good basketball player , and I practise it three or four times a week as I play in the University team .
There are some things I would like to know first of all , the kind of clothes I should take with me .
And finally , if you could tell when would I be leaving and coming back .
Yours sincerly
I got it two weeks ago in a concert , but although I 've been to the doctor , I ca n't get over it yet !
Well , but I do n't regret going to that concert .
A friend of mine was organising a pop concert , and as he knew me well , he asked me if I 'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show .
Of course , I accepted immediately very pleased .
It was a marvellous experience , I really enjoyed working with such a nice team , they were really kind with me .
And , as if it was n't enough , doing what I love !
And tell me , are you planning coming back to visit me ?
Please let me know if you have some days free so as to organise a little journey together .
Well , I think I 'd better close now .
Dear Sir / Madame ,
I 'm writeng with reference to your letter . I 've being very thrilled , when I 've known , that I won first prize in your competition . I always dreamed about going to the California and now my dreams are coming truth .
If it 's possible , I would like to travel only July , because my school wo n't be finished earlier .
I could n't go August , either , because I promised to go to Masurian Lakes with my friends .
If I had a choice , I would prefer to live in tent then in a log cabin .
I would be very grateful , if you gave me a possibility of singing .
I 've always wanted to learn singing professionaly , but I 've never had an occasion .
Normally , I live in the seaside and I could n't live without this sport .
Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters . distance .
I would like to ask you what clothes should I take with me ?
My mother told me , that when she had been there two years ago it was really hot .
Thanks for your last letter . I 'm sorry I haven't rewritten sooner , but I was very busy .
Well , it was the best time of my life ! I worked all days , but I did it with pleasure .
We lived here in rush , but there was a lot of fun , too .
I was very surprised , when I saw that singers are n't so sophisticated and self - confident as they are written in the newspapers .
One day I was talking to Stenkovska , because I had to go to buy something to eat for everyone , so I should ask her what did she want .
When she tried to answear me , one small child made her a picture with flesh .
Imagine , she were n't angry !
If I were she , I would kill that boy , but she was nice !
Trully , my work here was n't very important , but I relly enjoyed it .
I 've met here so many new people !
Sometimes somebody should on me , but I have to say they are often right .
Well , I made couple mistakes .
But , for luck , it was n't achieved with succes of our concert . You have to admit , that the show was magnificent .
I hope you had a great fun when you was watching us at the TV set , did n't you ?
I 'll write you again tomorrow , because now my Mom is angry , the I'am not sleeping yet .
I ca n't hardly wait .
I 'm writting this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London .
I see that you has already organised the programme .
So I 'm writting this letter , asking , if you can change the programme .
The London Fashion and Leisure show is a special event that is realized once a year , there are the latest Fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hair styles , all things that a young people wants to see .
There is a great opportunity to go there because the students need not pay anyting .
I 'm suggesting how programme could be changed .
The fashion starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be realized on 14 March , so we can change the shopping with this event that is realized in the afternoon , and put the shopping at night .
There will be a great success !
Your sincerely ,
That was my situation at the moment .
The story had began two days before ...
" The Honorable men 's group " , Dick , Nick and I , has formed this group .
Our mission was , stealing the women 's panties , I think that it was very stupid , but it was the most difficult thing that the humanity can do .
It prove our bravura to be a man .
Our first chalenge was stealing Dick 's girlfriend 's pantie , but it failed .
And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we had a conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult .
So we tried to stole adult 's panties .
Nick and Dick could prove their bravure stealing from their mother 's panties .
I was the only one that could n't stole any panties .
So I decided to go to my grand mother 's house and try to steal some panties .
" It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it " , to prove my bravure to all .
I had quickly , entered in my grandmother 's room and started to get some panties .
I was very nervous that I forgot my shoes .
Next day my Grand mother come and she gave my shoes to my mother .
I'M WRITING THIS LETTER TO EXPRESS THAT THE RESULTS CATCH ME ABSOLUTELY BY SURPRISE !
I WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY MOST TRAVELLING IN JULY BECAUSE I HAD TO PASS MY LITERATURE EXAMS BEFORE AND I'M TAKING IT IN JUNE .
ANSWERIN TO ANOTHER OF YOUR QUESTIONS , I ' PREFER TO HAVE ACCOMODATION ON LOG CABINS , BECAUSE OF MY COLUMN PROBLEM WHICH DON'T LET ME SLEEP ON THE GROUND ( OR ON A SLEEPING BAG ) .
DURING MY STAY AT THE CAMP I'M REALLY FOND OF KEEPING MY TENNIS AND SWIMMING ROUTINES .
I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MANTEIN A COLUMN TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAVE RECOMMENDED ME TO DO .
ALSO , IF I HAVE ANY LEISURE TIME BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PIANO LESSONS , I PRACTISE TENNIS .
SO , AND IF IT POSSIBLE , I WAS INTERESTED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF COVER MY ROUTIN THERE .
LASTLY , I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAD TO CARRY SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS FOR PREPAIRING MY LUGGAGE PUTTING ONLY THE APROPPIATES CLOTHES .
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU
ARE YOU A SCIENCE FICTION HISTORIES LOVER ?
ARE YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF KNOW HOW A MARTIAN IS ?
IF YOU REALLY FIND READING THIS KIND OF BOOK INTERESTING , YOU WON'T MISS THIS BOOK .
DURING , THE LAST MONTH I'VE BEEN READING " A WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE " AN OXFORD BOOKMARKS COLLECTION BOOK .
THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY WELL KNOWNS WRITTERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY .
BUT THE MAIN PURPOUSE OF THE BOOK IS ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND HAVE A LOOKING OF HOW A LIFE GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE , WHEN , PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE COMMANDED BY MACHINES .
I THINK THAT THIS IS A MARVELLOUS BOOK TO READ , BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT YOUR MIND UP AGAINST THEMES LIKE " HUMAN RACE EXTINTION " AND ALSO OBTAIN A COMPARISON BETWEEN HUMAN - MIND AND COMPUTERS .
SO , IF YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH A " REALLY SPLENDID SCIENT FICTION BOOK " I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ " A WINDOW .. " AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU FINISH READING IT YOU WANNA READ IT AGAIN , AND AGAIN ... !
Dear Helen Ryan ;
I am only available on July , is it fine for you ?
Because , the only time I can take holiday is July .
I would prefer log cabins , I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents .
About the two activities I choose swimming and painting . I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much .
I took swimming courses for four years .
And the reason I choose painting is it 's being very exciting to me , I am not very good at this subject but I would improve my painting .
I would like to ask whather you have competitions or different activities ?
Do you reccomend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well ?
Is it very expensive area ?
Thank you very much for your interest
I look forward to hearing from you
It 's been a long time not to write to you , I 'm really sorry but I was very busy .
I worked untill midnight everyday .
Actually I do n't work , you know , I had been decorating a concert hall for a pop concert .
It was very enjoyable I met lots of friends We 'd been together all day , painting the walls , cleaning putting some baloons and other staff everywhere .
And at the time of concert we wore a big funny costume , and danced with people .
Everybody liked it very much , Anyway we worked for that .
The most I like was meeting with the band .
Oh , my God they 're so nice , talkative , funny , people .
I am a student of the FCE class and I am writing to you in name of my class to thank you for the programme about the three days trip to London that you have prepared for us .
We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery .
Last week some students of our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March .
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear .
In addition we will have the possibility to see the newest make up and hairstyles .
For these reasons I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday 's afternoon .
You can give the possibility to the students too choose between go shopping or go to the show .
The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be opened until 7 .
I hope that this change will not cause to you too many problems .
In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life of the famous people .
In this occasion we can say that the journalists have , of course indirectly , caused her death .
On the other hand , the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives .
If one is famous it has to accept also the disadvantages of be famous .
The famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their work .
After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday .
In conclusion I think that there must be more compehension and respect between famous people and the media .
I am really pleased to hear from you I won first prize in the competition .
How I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter .
First , I am afraid but I can travel only in July .
I 've got three - month holiday from June to August but I 've already promised my aunt , who runs a small nursing home in Andover , to help her during June and in August .
Second , regarding accomodation , I 'd like to stay in a log cabin .
And I love to learn surfing and painting .
I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing .
I expect you have lovely nature in California for me to draw on my canvas .
What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take .
I am really looking forward to going there and your reply .
For example , any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends .
What 's worse , there is usually traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall .
So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment .
However , people ca n't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping .
For the handicapped , going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them .
Otherwise they can have lots of problem and difficult to live .
Thank you Very much for the letter you sent me .
I am Very happy in winning this prize and I hope my stay there will be great !
First of all , I can only travel in July because I have tests at school and they are Very important to me and I hope you Will understand my problem .
And I Will like to be accommodated in a log Cabin , because I do not like sleeping in tents , because of the bugs and insects .
For the activities I would like to chose the Tennis activities , which I am not too bad at , and climbing , Which I have never done but must be interesting .
I Would like to Know if I need to take any clothes , and , if yes , What Kind of Clothes ?
I also Want to Know if I should take any Money , or if all the expences are payed by You .
For example , when you buy something , you might lose it and never again see it , or you could be robbed , or even if the product has something wrong with it , then you have to swap it and that takes time .
And sometimes the credit card machines do n't work , or they do n't accept your card or even if you have exceeded the limit of your credit card .
Another bad thing is that people want something very badly , and they ca n't afford it .
That makes those people frustrated and they do n't enjoy theirselves .
Firstly , I was asked the time my trip would be and I have come to a conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go .
About accomodation in tents or log cabins , I would enjoy much more being in tents as I believe is the right type of accomodation for going camping ?
I actually have much resistance and balance so that will help me in both activities .
I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will helpful towards the preparation for the weeks in subject .
Men tease women as being shop - cravers and for having shopping as the nicest passtime .
However that impression is not always true .
Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes , however do we really like the process of chosing them ?
At times , it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something , which can kill a lot of time and specially when your does n't fit with the in fashion .
Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable , and many times they find , for example , a dress , they like a lot but they can not buy it because it is terribly expensive .
Then , I consider a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress .
Finally , you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts . etc .
I 'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organiced the last 21 and 22 of November .
I want you to know how extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival .
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable - priced ticket we paid for all the weekend .
The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows .
On my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small , you 've to consider make a big one for the next year because these kind of events are concurred by a lot of young people .
In conclusion , I wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend .
In my house rules practically do n't exist because I have 18 years old now so my parents only wish is that I study a carrear and be a good man .
They only want to know where I am and when I go out at what time I came home .
At school is complete different because the teachers do n't foregive you nothing .
You have to be quiet an attention in class if you would n't to be punished .
I would n't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to make the right things .
When I 'd time I will write you again
I 'm writing to you to complain about last evening musical show .
At first my favourite actor Danny Brook did n't perform without any explictions , and the show should started at 19:30 instead of 20:15 ! !
I was sure that discouts were available because I have read it , but at the tickets office they did n't accept them .
So I payed the ticket .
Jim 's mum did n't want him to take her suitcase , but he did it .
So a morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and take the train for the countryside where he had to work .
But when he walked out the station he realised that he have lost the suitcase on the train .
All this story was a secret but Pat realived to his mother .
She was so angry and confused because Jim haven't told her the truth .
I am writing to you because I am really dissapointed bout " Over the Rainbow " which I saw the other day in my stay in London which your company organized .
In your advertisement said the show will start at 19:30 however it began at 20:15 .
Even though , I ca n't understand the actor of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove does n't appeared in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook .
After all this I wanted to make my evening pleasant however for my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because some problems of sanitary .
I explained to you every detail about what happened in the musical show and I want you refund my money and send to me an apology for what happenned there .
I hope hear from you sooner as possible and thanks for understand my situation .
Yours fainthfully
Many years ago human beings or whatever we called was another animal species but when they tried to use rocks to make a fire we changed everything .
Modern technology changed our lifes in many ways , when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock , if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little of toothpaste .
I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and emsamblish by machines more powerful than handwork .
Even though , this is not enough the technology created a better way of communication , first there were letters , after telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through internet .
It is not necessary to imagine things , you can travel all around just making a click with your mouse and you are there .
If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take foods and cook it with a microwave .
When I have a headache I ate pills , made by technology . I think everything round us is thanks for technology but we ca n't forget that this things was made by us .
If we creates guns to protect our homes , others will use it to steal our homes , take advantage from the indefense people .
However , the technology never stops , we always search new things because we are made to compete , discover , think things which we do n't know .
Because it is the only free time I will have .
And I would prefer tent to log cabin .
Because I have had experiance to leve in tent and I like it very much .
Thank you for chance to do two activities .
I play tennis since I was ten years of age .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever plaed .
Another activity what I have chosen is photography .
I have just finished profesional photographer course and I would like to continiew my education in this activity .
First of all what kind of clothes I have to take with me ?
Also , how much money I have to take ?
Look forward to hearing from you .
Like I said , I 'd helped at a pop concert .
It was very interesting and enjoing .
A pop concert had ten pop bands .
Each of them must sang two songs .
After all they chose three best bands .
While this concert I saw a lot of popular singers .
I knew you love them and I took two autographs for you and of course for myself .
I was shoked because I had alredy spoken with them and I had taken two autographs .
Another part of my experiance at pop concert when we will meet each other .
I went to the Circle Theatre , three weeks ago , to see " Over the Rainbow " , the musical show that was played at this moment .
First of all , the actors mentionned in the advertisement were not those who played the show .
The , if the show had started on time , it could have been much better , but it started forty five minutes late , it is too much for me !
Plus , it is mentionned , on your advertisement , that discounts were available , in fact , no discount were done to me , whereas I am a student and as a student I was allowed to have a discount but I paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discount for this show .
Finally , I think that this evening was very far to be perfect , and I ask you for my money , I spent for this horrible evening in your theatre , back .
Your Faithfully
It is faster with new technologies to go from one place to another , for example , we can us a car or public transports such as trains or buses instead of walking or riding as in the past .
Our everyday activities or family activities are simplified too , washing the dishes or clothes by hand is rarely done , some specific machines are made to do this stuff , it helps us to spend much more time in extra activities like sport , relaxing ...
New technologies allow us to work more efficiently , with computers , complex operations can be achieved in a close time and with the insurance that the result is correct .
Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us , we can also inform ourselves on what happens in live , or search for special leisure with a quick result .
But firstly I want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival , people need this kind of events .
Secondly I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it .
As it was written in your advertisement , artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented , I was quite disappointed .
However the concerts were great , but unfortunately , some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro - wave inside .
Plays and Films were good and I liked them , but there were only a few , I hope there will be many more next year .
One of the most positive aspect of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket .
As a student , the low priced ticket certainly athacted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists .
Finally , I would like to make one big suggestion : you should find a place for a camping so that people who come from a long way do n't have to spend money on accomodation .
Young people always need money , specially students who do n't earn their life .
They need money to pay their studies or for going out , but how to find a job which is good and not under - paid ?
Furthermore departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work .
Unfortunately it 's not possible unless you can rest in the morning .
If you are a really good student in one subject , you can provide private lessons which is one of the most prolific job but do it only if you like teaching .
The main thing to remember is that there many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say : " I want to work and earn money " .
I am writing to thank you for the well organised programme you have done .
It will be a good opportunity for visiting London and its interesting places like the Science Museum .
In addition it is properly to mention you that all the students of my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure show , which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall .
The London Fashion and Leisure show is an amaizing show because there are parades with the latest fashions , we could know some famous top models Besides there are a variety of clothes either sport wear as elegant desings .
Not only we could see the latest trend in make - up but hairstyles performed by important coiffeurs .
Maybe we could go on shopping on Wednesday afternoon and on Tuesday we could go to The Show .
We would like to have reply to became making the arrangements .
Yours faithfully ,
I have never imagined I had to face this situation .
I joined with an expedition team in order to explore the Rocky Mountains .
We planned a programme .
We arrived to the place in the morning and started to walk .
Every thing was marvellous , I got on well with all the partners .
The landscapes were the most beautiful that I had ever seen before .
The weather was delightful , except this afternoon when started to rain and we decide to stay during the night inside a hole in the wall of the mountain .
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it , when a rain of stones covered the entrace of the hole .
I was terrified , I knew that the only solution was to ask for helping .
I walked alone a long distence until I found a telephone , I called the police and they ask for a rescue .
Thanks to God everything finished in a good way . and my partners were successfully rescued .
I 'd like to explain you the problems I have had when I went to the theatre .
The main problem I had was the actor , because he was n't Danny Brook .
Another problem I had was the time .
I was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining .
I 'd like to explain too that I did n't see that you made discounts to no one .
I was queuing for a long time and I did n't see it .
And I went with a lot of friends and we did n't have any discount .
Another question is that in the advertisement you advised we could visit your restaurant but as it was closed we could n't do it .
And that are all problems I found .
And , because of these faults , I 'd like to have my money back . If you do n't mind , of course .
We went at the same school and at the same class .
I told her that and she assured me that she would n't say it to him .
When we finished our primary school we went at the same secundary school too , but we were in different classes .
We went out every weekends .
And when we finished the secundary school , I decided go to a foreign University .
I spend five years there , although I came all summers and we continued going out as we did before .
When I finished I return to my city to find a job .
A day , Pat told me that we was talking with this boy and that he told her that I like him and immediately she told him that he liked me too .
A week after that I found him in a coffee and he asked me if I would like to be his girlfriend and I accepted .
Secondly , the show was really late .
It started at 20.15 , not at 19.30 as it was supposed to be .
And , although you have promised in your advertisement , there were no discounts available .
To make things worst , the restaurant was closed .
The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show in that date .
And , I would appreciate if you give me a refund .
I look forward to hear from you .
In my opinion , the clothes will be more colourful , funny and confortable .
I think that we will not use formal clothes anymore .
People will prefer to use confortable clothes , even to go to the office .
The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more funny .
We will not use black clothes as we are used to do .
People will use yellow , pink and green clothes .
However , the clothes will not be as teenagers use to wear nowadays to go to " raves " .
It will be more beautiful and clean .
They will wear a clothe only if they feel good wearing it .
Actually , I think that the clothes will be really simplier in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then .
Now all the town knew my secret .
This is a very embarrassed situation .
This story started when I arrived to this town with family .
We come here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires .
My mother suggested to come here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us .
I had n't known all of us ( my uncle , my aunt and my beautiful cousin ) up to that day .
My uncle , called Paul , offered us to stay with his family up to we could build our house .
Cassually my cousin had the same age as me , sixteen , that 's the reason for we started a friendly relationship .
We spend all the time together .
This " friendly " relationship was starting to make hot .
I never had a boyfriend and I felt in love with him .
I felt that I had discovered other ways .
In fact , I did .
I am writing to express my pleasure about the successful programme that you have prepared for our school , especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery .
We are really interested in latest fashions and new hairstyles , but also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and especially girls enjoy seeing the different kinds of making up .
Furthermore , we have been informed that students are allowed to see this exhibition without paying money .
This event takes place in Central Exhibition Hall in London , on Tuesday on 14th of March .
If you agree to visit this exhibition , we will spend our day there , thus we should cancel the shopping , but we will be able to purchase some presents next day , as you have not organised a specific plan .
I had to hit a human being and unfortunately , although I respect every form of life humans , animals and plants , I managed to hit a burglar .
Three months ago , I can not forget this day , my parents visited my aunt at hospital as she was ill .
A short man stood in front of me !
Without any warning he pushed my arms .
I shouted as I pained .
I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him , I found one hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him .
My name is Yakimo Nashoto , I study in France and I went to London just to see " Over the Rainbow " because all my friends told me that it was " great " .
However , when I saw it , I was really disapointed and I ask you some money back .
The reasons why I was disappointed were :
First of all , Danny Brook was not there , I was very upset because he is my favorite singer and it was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show .
Then , the show started t 20.15 pm instead of 19.30 .
My Euro Star was at 22 pm .
On the developpement , they also said that they will be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty - five years old but it was totally wrong because I paid the full price which was £ 20 .
Finally , I wanted to buy something to drink , the restaurant was closed because it was on a bank holiday !
As a conclusion , it was the worse evening I have ever had in my life so I ask you for money back .
Your faithfully ,
The modern technology has changed my daily life a lot .
First of all , Internet makes my life easier .
Some of my friends live in overseas , we keep in touch by e - mails , it is a very good way for communicating because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re - read mails and keep them forever .
Then , nine persons out of ten have a mobile phone in our society . I have one too !
when I want to call someone , I do n't need to look after a phone box .
people can phone me at anytime they want from everywhere
when I go out , sometimes my parents are worried so they phone to me if everything is going alright .
Finally , there is a TV in my parent 's car .
We can watch TV , there is also a map so when we get lost , it is very east to find out the place .
As a conclusion , I agree that modern technology has changed my daily life but I am sure that in the future , my life will not be the same as now because more modern technology will appear .
I am writting in order to complain about the musical show " Over the rainbow " .
At first , the advertisement said that the show was starring by Tina Truelove and Danny Brook , that was not true , Danny Brook did not act in the show , it was a different actor and I got disappointed with him .
In order to the times , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 , nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenary .
The advertisement said that there were discounts available , that was false , there were not any kind of discounts .
After all I just wanted to go to the restaurant of the theatre and have something to eat , but it was closed because the police had closed it .
They had closed it because they had found the food in bad conditions .
Just to finish , the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out , let me tell that it was n't not .
I paid a full ticket without discounts to wait 45 minutes , to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed .
I think the theatre should give me my money back and I hope you do it .
The technology has changed , is changing and it will change our daily lifes .
Now we can cook in a easier way than ten years before , we can talk with somebody who is 10000 kilometres from us and we can know what 's happening in the other part of the world .
Another thing is changing our life is the computer , especially Internet .
More and more people are connecting through the net .
Soon we wo n't need to get out from our homes .
Now we can buy everything by Internet , we can see what 's happening in Wall Street , we can send mail in a easier way , by e - mail and many people has started to work at home by their computers .
Technology has changed so much our daily lifes that we wo n't be able to live without it .
Nobody can imagine to live without a T.V. , a computer , a microwave , a telephone .
There are machines for everything , to write , to cook , to go from one place to other , to talk with somebody who is not with you .
Our lifes are very different from our grandparent 's lifes and that 's because the technology .
I am writing to complain about a musical show which is called " Over The Rainbow " and ask for money back .
First of all , the poster told me that this show was performed by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there was different actor .
Secondly , the show was expected to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 .
I have been waiting for 45 minuties .
As you know the show started late , so , I was not able to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed before the show has been finished .
Thirdly , there was no discounts available but it was printed on the poster .
If there was no discounts , do n't write it on the poster .
I got confused and disappointed again .
Finally , I would like to have my money back . I am looking forward for your prompt reply and improvement .
So , modern technology is needed to meet the requirement .
In an every single day , many modern technology is produced and it really affects or changes our daily life .
The most important development is the internet system which is connected to the whole world 's computers by some telephone liens .
You can send a letter to your friend by an e - mail but not writting it on a piece of paper and send it by post .
How convenience it is !
There are also much more advantages , you can buy somethings in a supermarket by only a mail order , you do n't need to go out of your home .
Other than the internet system , there is also many modern technology which is changing our daily life .
For example , we can go to the Mars and do some invesgation .
Some modern technology is also put into the transport system .
The modern technology has changed our daily life .
It aims at improving our standard of life and makes us live more comfortably .
Dear Sir , I 'm writing this letter to you because I 'm very disappointed and I believe you have to hang me some money back .
Before I bought my ticket and booked train and hotel reservations I 'd read a lot good reviews about that show and I thought it was a great moment to share with friends .
Firstly your advertisement is a real lie .
Then the show was late , we had been waiting for a long long time before it started .
I saw a young actor who I 've never seen and who seemed not to know by heart his role !
After that " show " we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand but what a surprise !
It was n't at all a perfect evening I 'm not pleased .
To summarize I want that you hang me my money back and very quickly .
Your faithfully ..
Modern technology had changed human being 's daily life long before I was born .
Nowadays according to me the most important revolution is connected with new technologies .
Let 's take the mobil phone .
Our parents used the phone to make an important appointment .
Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is " mobil " .
And I 'm not different I 've got one and it has changed my everyday life .
I always can be reached , I can phone friends when I know I would be late and thanks to that appliance I feel less nervous and now I 'm sure I could n't live without it .
It 's the same with Internet and that 's a very new thing .
I send and receive more mails than letters !
I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I 'm working because it take up just some minutes .
With Internet and according to me the world is become smaller and bigger at the same time .
Yes my daily life has been changed and it 's a good thing .
I 'm writting this letter to complain about your fake advertisement .
You are the theatre 's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain .
First of all in your show advertisement sais that Danny Brooks starts in the play .
But a different actor has started and that was very disappointing not only for me but for all people there .
The show has begun later , much more later than your advertisement writes , at about 20:15 .
The show started 45 minutes later .
This made me get bored .
You also refer to your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there were n't any .
At the end you have written that there is the theatre restaurant after the show but there was n't .
It had closed because of the late start of the show .
At the end because I ; had n't have a perfect evening but a very disappointing one , I have the right to ask my money back .
Modern technology changed not only my daily life but also the life of many people .
First of all I do n't have to worry n the morning if I miss the bus because I have my alarm clock to wake me in time .
Usually When I return from school the food is a lit of bit cold so I put it in the microwave to become hotter .
When I go to sleep after I eat my lunch in my country especially in summer is too hot .
So I turn on the aircondition with timer so when I get sleep to turn off by itself .
When I wake up if I do n't have homework I sit on my computer and play different games to spend my time .
At the evenings before I got to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV through the sattelite .
When I go to bed because there are many mosquitoss I turn on a special machine with pile like thing in it which kills them .
I belive that modern technology has effected possitive our lives .
I am really pleased hearing from you , I won the prize .
As regards your questions , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am a student and my summer holiday will start on 27th June so I can go to U.S.A in July and I prefer staying in tents because I have never experienced camping in the tent .
In case of swimming , I am really good at it but I just started playing tennis before 3 weeks .
However , I am very enjoying playing tennis .
Actually I have never gone camping so I really have no idea about that .
Do you think if there is some occasions to spend money or not ?
I am really expecting going camping
We would like to thank you for this London trip and your programme related to it .
It is really good programme , especially visiting Science Museum and National Art Gallery would be great opportunity to learn about art and latest improvements in science .
However , my classmates and I saw the advertisement with regarding the London fashion and leisure show , which is enclosed , and want to take this opportunity to visit it , if you allow us .
It takes place in Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March .
It will be great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear , new hairstyles and make up industry .
Although according to your programme , we will be visiting Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon , we would like to make a suggestion which can help us to be able to stick to both .
Would it be possible to visit Science Museum and go shopping in our free time on Wednesday in the afternoon , instead of it to go to the London fashion and leisure show , because it is between 10.00 and 19.00 hours .
Thanking in advance , we very much hope that you will give your attention to our requirement .
We look forward to hearing from you relating to this matter .
One of the most important subject of the media is to inform people bout famous people such as politicians , films stars or successful musicians .
In order to fullfill their readers ' requirements they always follow them .
it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not , they just try to find the best pose .
After taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them , they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission .
This is the most argueing point .
Do they have to ask for their permission or not .
However , if they would ask , obviously they can not take the kind of pictures , which show them naked or when they are having shower .
May be they have to pay for this kind of pictures .
On the other hand , famous people have point , if they do not allow paparazzis to take their pictures . Because , althoug they are famous they have also their private life .
Unless they do not want to share it , it must be acceptable for us .
It was said that while they were trying escape from paparazzis they had that accident , which caused of their lives .
This can not be the way in finding information for the readers .
Thank you very much for your programme but we have another plan to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show which unluckily on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum so we would like you to change the plan a little .
Your programme is very good , especially that we can go to visit the Science Museum which I heard is very good but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the lastest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hair styles and it is free for students too .
So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and to do the shopping after the show .
I climed up the tree .
If I had n't borrowed it from him , I would n't have been here .
No , it was n't the time to regret , just get it and it would be all over .
I stressed my arm , the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg .
It was very hurt , my friend rushed to me than ran back to my house and called Mom .
Mom came in , looking very angry , I prayed for a short conversation .
I want to complain about your advertisment about the theatre ' Over the Rainbow ' I had a very disappointing evening .
First of all I wanted so much to see my favourite actor Danny Brook as he was supposed to be in the show , but he was n't .
Secondly the show did n't start until 20:15 but it should have started 19:30 so we had to sit and wait which was very boring .
There were no discounts on the ticket available either .
After the show we wanted to have something to eat in the theatre restaurant but it was closed because rebuilding .
She had always been like that , said my best friend Ann to me when I told her that I had told Pat a secret yesterday .
The secret was that I was in love with Peter in my course .
Yesterday when I arrived to the college , I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strange at me and laufhing .
In the classroom it became even worser .
People started to whrite things on the board and pointing at me .
In the lunchbreak I went to Pat and asked her why she had told him the secret , but she just ignored me like she did n't know me .
I am writing this letter to complaint about the musical show that Circle Theatre company played few days ago .
Anything the advertisement said was correctly done .
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty - five minutes we were waiting for the beginning .
It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one .
Secondly , an other point that disappointed me was the actor that played the main role .
He was not Danny Brook , and the main reason that I came to see this show was the possibility to see him acting .
I am a fan of him .
When I went to get the ticket , and the women said me that the discounts were not available I knew that it would n't be a good night .
Finally , the restarant were I would like to have dinner with friends after the show was closed against what was announced in the advertisement .
Nobody told us about the reasons of the problems .
These are the reasons why I am complaining , and I would like to know if there will be some money back .
I will be waiting news from you .
Perhaps , modern technology has changed my life style but I do n't think so because I was born in the period of modern developments .
Since I was born I have lived involved of technological instruments like personal computers , mobile phones , television , etc .
And the development of them does n't worries me , like people against technology .
The only thing I can say about technology is that has driven my life .
Modern technology attracts my atention , and this is the reason why I have chosen an electronic caree .
I think technology does n't change the life style .
Is the life style or necessities from people what make technology develop .
All kind of industrial machines are created to solve problems , improve other machines or to do n't waste so many time .
But these ones bring new problems that must be solved by others .
I 'm writting to answer your questions but , first of all , to thank you for the prize .
I would like to travel in July because it is school holliday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel , so I have no preference for the weeks .
I do n't mind staying in log cabins , but I prefer camping because I want to be really near the nature .
Well , about the activities , I love Photography , I made a course and I would like to take beautiful photos of the Camp .
And I always was good at swimming , now I 'll be at the Camp during the summer I think it is a good idea .
I do n't know how much money I 'll need to the trip and what kind of clothes I 'll need .
Do you have any night plan , like going to discos or night clubs ?
Can you give this informations ?
I 'm looking forward to receving your letter .
Your sincerely
Nowadays shopping is one of the activities that makes our society lives .
The cities are the main commercial centre , our streets are full of billboard advertising many things and .
Despite this shopping culture , shopping is not always enjoyable , when you need to buy something you have to look for the best price , what is always a work of time , and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper , it must be crowded .
The solution can be in a alternative way of making shops like Internet .
You can by anything without problem , this is a good thing although this prevents poor people from shopping by Internet , because you have to have a computer .
Anyway , other alternatives of shopping are being created and we can choose for not waste our time shopping .
The manager of the Circle theatre .
Dear sir or madam ,
I am writing to you in response of your advertisement about the show of the Circle Theatre .
I have to say that I am realy disappointed bout your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true .
Firstly I 'd like to complain about the actor of the show .
On your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appear on the stage that night .
Secondly another ploblem was about the starting time , according to your advertisement the play starts at 19.30 and instead it started on 20:15 , this is about almost an hour delay .
Moreover , there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount , Something that was n't true .
Furthermore On your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play , but the restaurant was closed and I 'd like to know why .
I am very disappointed about the whole situation and I am not happy to ask for a money refund .
The 21st Century is also known as the gold century of high technology and science .
Many thinks have changed within the last 100 years .
Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into a growing monster which does n't have an ending .
Every single day we hear about new products , new methods , new technological miracles which have turned up side down our daily lives .
The simpliest example of modern high tech is the introduction of the computer - or better known as the P.C - .
Reserches have shown that almost every single house owns a P.C. Some people use them for their job because they do need it , but others , like children , use it just for fun .
Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the T.V , the microwave , the video the satelite , the cd player and hundreds of others .
All thease play a serious role in our daily life with out ever understanding it .
All of us have turned into pathetic , technological , robots .
Those things can and do make our lifes easier and more comfortable , but the call us away from our friends , our families and more over they lead us to madness and cut any relantionship with everything that suround us and keep us in life .
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00 I was really amazed with the new that I 'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
Respect to the date that I would like to travel must be only on July 15th because my classes will finish at the end of June and I 'm going to be with free time to do so since this date until early August that I will start to work .
I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in log cabins .
I think is going to be more confortable for me due that I'am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I ca n't take the risk to catch a cold as you know I 'm going to start to work .
The activities that I would like to do there are the followings:- Singing ( I 'm very good singer ) ; swimming ( I 'm not good at all at this one ) but I enjoy to spend time in the water I really do .
Would you be so kind to let me know what kind of weather do you have on July in order to choose the right cloth to bring and also I would like to know approximately the amount of money that I should bring for the items that are not cover .
How are you ? I 'm fine and I writting you because I know that you want to know my experience at a pop concert ; I have to tell you that I did to help there and was a very hard work you ca n't imagin all the work that mean to prepare a concert .
I really enjoyed the opportunity to talk with well known starts and to learn how to set up everything for a concert .
If you have the opportunity to do this do n't missed out .
I hope to see you soon to tell you more details .
I am writting you for complaining about the last saturday evening performance in your theatre .
First of all , the principal character was not Danny Brook , but a substitute , and the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before .
Secondly , the show started 45 minutes late . We would not have had discounts on price and any worker wanted to give us an explanation for that .
After the show , we decided to go to the restaurant to dinner , but it was closed for work .
Everything was completely different from what you had announced on the advertisement
I am sure you understand why I am so upset and you will do your best to give me satisfaction , I mean , refunding me exactly what I had paid for this terrible evening .
Modern technology has changed my daily life , making it easy , with less effort and time spent .
A simple example , we can at the same time wash our clothes with a washing machine , record a tv program and talk to someone on the other side of the world .
All this in one morning , and the day just begins , what doing next ?
Technology allows to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like to . We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention , time is not a really problem .
We will see people differently , with more calm , because we have no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else .
We will be more comprehensible with others .
It is the first step for a true fraternity .
All this modern technology increase the level of polluted products that can not be easily destructed .
Living better , people live longer and it is necessary to product more food , but more food means chemical agents on earth , the circle never stops .
In conclusion , modern technology allows me to live better and to have more time to do what I really like , although I know , all this has a price .
Thank you for sending me this wonderful news . I was really happy when I knew I won the first prize .
I am writing to give you my details and ask some more information .
I am a college student and I am going to study in university this year .
I will take my exams in June and have the result in August .
Secondly , I prefer staying in log cabins so that I can have more chance to be with other people , then I can make more friends .
During the camp , I will do sing and climbing activities .
I enjoy singing all the time and I want to share my music with the others .
Finaly , I want to know what the weather is like in California in July .
Do I need some special clothes for the camp and how much money shall I bring for other expenses .
I am looking forward to hear from you .
To : The teacher of English class
Subject : The lessons should be filmed
Date : 13 , June , 00
Instruction :
English class is going to make a short video about school daily life .
The aim of this report is to give the suggestion of which lessons and activities should be filmed .
Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students talk about some topics they choose and discuss with others in order to prove their speaking and listening skills .
Topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up - dated .
The teacher use video , pictures to show students about festivals , sports , museums , ect .
It is popular by the students .
Canteen is the place students stay together apart from class .
Quite a lot of students spend their free time there for relaxing and talking .
Basketball is the most popular activity , whick takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week .
Not only the students who have activity play but also a lot of students watch .
The lessons and activities above are the suggestion should be filmed .
I have recieved your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize .
I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time for me to go on holiday because the 12th July is my birthday .
I want to sleep in tents because I think it 's more adventurous better scenery , and atmosphere .
You also asked me about the two things I 'm good at , well , the first one is basketball .
I have been playing basketball for roughly about 4 years .
I have been practcing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 U.S open tour last summer .
Would I have to bring many clothes e.g. would we do a lot of outdoor activities , get dirty etc .
Would I need a lot of money .
Looking forward to see you soon .
People today shops sevendays a week with their family , friends etc .
This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for the world .
The more stuff we buy the more we throw away .
Therefor you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy .
For example , you can do sports which is enjoyable and good for your health .
Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports which is for your own benefit .
You must think about your children who would be living in the world you helped to destroy .
I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping is n't always enjoyable and change your view in looking at shopping .
I 'm writting to complain about your theatre and its last night show .
Firstly I would lice to say that I am very dissappointed with the show and that I did n't have the perfect evening out , as you had advertised .
I have no idea from where to start .
The main character of the musical show , which I 'd like to say was n't the " BEST " , was awfull .
His act was not good and he did n't seem like acting Even my son could act better .
After the horrible act of your star , it comes the starting ours .
I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes until the play started .
You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15 as it did .
And then , when I arrived at the theatre I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I did n't .
Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed , because the shef and the waiters where on holiday .
You could hire other to do the work .
I was very dissappointed what else can I write .
It was suppose to be my perfect everning out .
I will ask my money back .
In Conclusion I 'd like to recoment that you should , first , know what you have to offer and the advertising it .
Yours sensirly
Helena .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I should n't have told her that my dad had physcological problems .
I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell it to my brother .
It all started when I was about 10 years old , like my brother now , and I overheard my mother talking about my father and his problems , to my aunt . I was hurt inside and cried till my tears run dry .
All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accitend .
I was leaving in a lie .
Now in the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake to say , this problem to my " friend " Pat .
I knew that she is close to my brother and that she loves him a lot , so I never thought that things could turn like this .
When , one day Pat came over to my house we started arguing about common things and in our fite suddenly came about the subject of my father and his problems .
Pat started shouting and screaming , saying what was realy going on .
He stand outside my door and heard every single word .
When I realised it , it was too late .
The secret was revilied .
And now I try to help my brother beaus I 've been there , in his place , and I know how it feels .
I am so grateful and I ca n't believe I am so lucky to receiving your letter in which said that I have won the first prize in your competition , for two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A.
I am writing to inform that I can only go in July , the summer holiday , because I have got a place in the university and it will start in August .
Is there the time I request available ?
I would also like to ask accommodation you offer are in tens or log cabins .
If I can choose I would prefer tens .
I can wait to do my painting for the rising sun , and ca n't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers .
Finally , can you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with , and how much spending money will be need .
Sometime when I 'm boring and ca n't find something else to do .
I go look round shops .
When I see some clothes in the window I like , I would go in and try them .
But I always finds it not look nice on me .
The other thing I do n't like going shopping is in the weekend .
All the shops are full of people , and people treat the articals like rubbish . Hang them every where after they tried and that was not suit them .
Also in the weekend shopping . You do ca n't find some where to sit down comfortaly to have a cup of tea .
Mc . Donnals , K.F.C , the all full of people .
However , shopping is nice to spend you leisure time and give yourself to relax sometimes , but suggest that never in the weekend .
According to your advertisement , it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE , but surprisinggly , it was proformed by a different actor who I even did n't know the name .
In addition , the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half hour later , until 20:15 .
To make the matter worse , I had expected the ticket with some discount , but when I went to the ticket box , there was no any discount available .
You can imagine how disappointed I am when spending money on such a terrible evening .
I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insisted on some money back .
Nowadays , we use a lot of modern technology both at home and office but it has its aventage and disaventage .
The first and most important thing is that modern technology have made our life easier , for instance ricer cooker is a great invention , all you have to do is putting rice on it and switch on , it makes cooking more effeciently .
Furthmore , we can use computer and telephone a lot .
It is often suggested that , modern technology makes the gap bigger between peoples , they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings .
To sum up , I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not alway rely on it .
Spending a week in London for holidays last week , I had decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show .
Unfortunately , I had a really disappointed evening !
Indeed , firstly , the play did n't start at 19:30 as it was planned on the advertisement but 45 minutes later ( 20:15 ) .
Then , the actors ( Danny Brook and Tina Truelove ) who were mentioned and supposed to play were n't present .
There were different actors who took the role .
I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are so great actors and I was very excited to see them .
Furthermore , on the advertisement I got , was written that the theatre restaurant was opened .
I told myself , I could eat over there and maybe spend a better evening than at the begining but I was n't lucky because the restaurant was closed !
No reasons were indicated .
As you can notice , my perfect evening I had supposed , was a nightmare ; that 's why I would please you to give my money back because I can not tolerate such a thing !
From the begining of the century to now , modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier .
Indeed , the modernism helps us to lead a confortable and better life than before .
For example , cars , planes are a wonderful invention ! A few centuries ago , it took many hours ( even several days ) to go to a city to an other one or to travel abroad .
People could n't think of such innovation in our world and yet , it was created .
Human being became more and more clever and built wonerful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands .
The communication has made many progresses too .
Everyone gets a television at home . "
Although there are new machines etc , the health makes many discoverts thanks to the searching on different diseases in order to make the population lived older .
Thus , the modern technology seems to be a positive way in order to improve our daily life .
I have won the first prize ! I am extremly happy about this .
I am writing because of same information that you need .
I have only the possibility to take holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginn of August .
When I was a child we were often camping .
To stay in a tent will remind my of a unforgottable time .
There are a lot of interesting activities and it makes hard to choose only two .
Given the circumstances I would like to learn more about Photograhy and Painting .
I have same skills in drawing landscape but I have no idea about photography .
Taking picture is a new experience for me .
I have never been I California .
Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I prefer to take traveller queckes ?
Yours faithfully
I could n't write you because I was very busy .
I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hopped to see a lot of diffrent people .
Given the circumstances they asked my for helping in the kitchen .
But it turned out as a funny and interesting job .
I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal .
It means I had to read the recipies very carefully .
And I had to controll that nothing will be missed .
The best thing was that I learnd a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks .
On the other hand I had a lot to do and I was never bored .
The time was quickly over and it was a great experience .
Warm whishes
Dear Sir or Madame ,
I am writing to you to complate about the show " Over the Rainbow " at your theatre " The Circle Theatre " .
I am deeply disapointed with the service and the unrealiable notice , at your theartre .
I 've attened your shown on one of the evening , during my stay in London .
I am very disapointed by this .
You also mention that your show would starts at 19.30 but to my knowleage it started at 20:15 and that is fourty - five minutes of waiting .
It also mention other services would be availalde to the adicne .
For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant were closed after the show , when it was mean to be open after the show acording to the advertisement but was closed dure to the delay of the preformane .
Lastly your advertisement mention clearly that this would be " Your perfect evening out ! " but sadly it was a real waste of time for me .
And I would like a refun , You have wasted my evening and money .
Your faithfully ,
For the past 100 year , fashion has change a great deal .
Now a day clothes is designed to be more comfortable .
Material and coloures of your cloths has changed since the early 1900 's to 2000 .
Synethetic was created by scientis .
Clothes are now mass producted and desing by desingers .
Desingres are unique in the way but their desings are some times more , a pirce of art and not for realistic perposoe .
It is hard to imageine what people would were in 100 years time , because since the 1900 's clothes have reduce into smaller item and more preticle .
May be it would contine reduceing in 100 years to come .
Scinetis might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde .
It could be that you would carry a small round box .
It would provide you with a new type of material to cover you body and you can chosse what you want to wear by pressing bottons .
This would be very easy to mantage but that mean no shopping for girls .
It would be scarly to live in the new 100 years , but it would be interesting to see what will happen .
Hopefully it would n't be verybody walking around neaked .
Thank you , it 's great to hear for about my winning .
You ask me for some informations - here they are .
First I can do the travel only in July , because I ca n't get freetime in any other month .
The next thing is , that I would prefer a log cabine .
About the activities during the Camp I can tell you , that I like to play Tennis and I do it very good .
Another thing I want to try , if possible , is to play Golf .
It 's a very favourite sport also in our region ( area ) , but I did never found time to do it .
I 'm a beginner in Golf you have to know .
Now a question from me to you : Is it possible to pay the different things with credit - card ?
Another question - what sorts of clothes shall I bring with me ?
Is July a hot and dry month or is it raining sometimes ?
I think , this will be all I want to know .
If there is any other question from your part , please call me or write again .
I 'm looking forward to hear from you ,
yours sincerely
sorry , I 'm late I know , but now I will tell you something about my experience last month .
The concert started on the 15th of may and it was a real great session in our valley .
I was so happy when they told me to help them with the organisation .
I was responsible to the advertisments and I had also to invite the " important persons " from our governement .
It was realy a new job for me , but I think , I have done good .
I 've learned a lot about management and especially - how stars are living .
One evening we went all together out for diner and after we visited our new disco .
Now Kim , I will finish my letter but I promise you to write again as soon as possible , maybe if I 've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the ....
A good idea at least - you come here and I tell you some other story 's .
In the meanwhile enjoy your life -
Moreover , the show started late : instead of 19.30 ( time in the advertisement ) people were allowed in at 20:15 , resulting in waiting time of 45 minutes .
There were two other problems : there were no discounts contrary to the information in the advertisement , and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repairement works .
We are living in a technologically advanced world where we are surrounded by all sorts of devices , which would seem fantastic to our ancestors .
I would rather type some coursework up than hand - write it .
This made my life easier , and at the same time saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut .
When I am too tied to go out but want to meet some new people , computer technology provides me with this opportunity .
Using the Internet , I can meet people all around the world not going anywhere .
First of all , I would like to say thank to you for this good programme , especially the decision of going to visit in London .
All of us is appreciated that we could have this opportunity .
Because most students have never been to London before , also we could visit some famous places which we wanted to go .
However , we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show additionally .
This show takes place at Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 .
In this show , not only can we see latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles , but we also can enter for free .
If you would accept and would n't mind this idea , we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday .
Nowadays , quite a few famous people suffer their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters .
I would like to think how media effect to famous people .
Few years ago , we had a terrible news of death of Lady Diana .
She was always been aftering by media .
Finally , after chasing for long time , she was dead because of car accident .
It must be a good example of media disaster .
However she definetely deserve to have a private life as one of citizen .
Human right must be existed for all people .
On the other hand , there are few famous people desire to be watched by media .
If media stopped focusing the people , they would think as if they are put in a bin like rubbish .
Moreover , many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or in a magazine .
It is one of fun in our life .
Thank you for your letter and for having inform me about the results of the competition . I also want to congratulate you for your exellent competition , thank to which I have the opportunity to go to California , a place that I always wanted to go .
About the travel , I think it would be preferable to do it on July , which is a holiday periode and so I wo n't have any special obligations .
While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent , so I can live closer to the nature .
Stay a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worse thing to do , specialy during a trip !
Moreover would like if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball .
Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful .
Before ending my letter I would like to know and be told specialy in what kind of clothes should I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine in Dollars .
I look forward to hearing from you
As you know last month I went to help at a concert , the one that I told you in my last letter .
I wanted to go very much there and so go there for helping was for me a unique chance .
Moreover instead of bying a ticket I entered there for free , as a helper .
From the first time that went there I understood that I was going to have a great night .
OK in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do , so as cleaning the stage and so some decoration work .
But as the correct started and we finished what we had to do , we were free to do what ever we wanted .
The pop concert was exellent and I had a lot of fun .
Do n't ask the time in which I come home because I do n't remember !
Best whishes
I AM WRITTING IN ORDER TO COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE OFFER .
I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME , UNFORTUNETELY , THINGS WERE VERY WRONG .
FIRSTLY , IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE STAR WAS DANNY BROOK , AND THAT WAS FALSE BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR .
SECONDLY , THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON , BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGH ,
THAT IS FOURTY - FIVE MINUTES LATER ! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE , HOWEVER , THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE .
LASTLY , AFTER THAT AWFULL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT , OF COURSE , I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE .
AS YOU CAN SEE , THAT WASN'T MY PERFECT EVENING OUT ( AS YOU PROMISE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT ) , SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK .
UNFORTUNETELY , PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED IT TOO LATE .
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE , I WOULDN'T TOLD HER THAT I HAD DISSAPROVE MY MATHEMATICS EXAM .
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUE WITH MY MOTHER .
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS , SO MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD .
AFTER THAT PAT INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CONCERT OF CHARLY GARCIA .
THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWIN FRIDAY , WICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS .
I REALLY WANTED TO GO , AND I KNEW THAT MY EXAM WAS NO GOOD , SO I TOLD MY MOTHER THAT I WOULD GET MY QUALIFICATIONS THE NEXT MONDAY , SO MY MOTHER ALLOWED ME TO GO .
THAT FRIDAY , I KNEW THAT I HAD DISSAPROVED THE EXAM , AND PAT KNEW IT TOO . OF COURSE , I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT TELLING THAT TO MY MOTHER , BUT PAT CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD IT TO MY MOTHER , WITHOUT ANY INTENTION .
Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre :
I 'm writing to you to explain some problems about your theatre 's show , first I have to say to you that there was a different actor starring the act .
I expect that starring the act was Danny Brook and there was another man .
I 'm very disappointed with the hour that the act started .
About the prize , the paper that I have at home tells that there were discounts availables , if these discounts are true I could n't use them .
When the show had finished I could n't visit the restaurant of the theatre because it was closed .
The reason they gave us , was that they had n't got any waiters .
For all those reasons I give to you , I ask for the money I had payed to you back .
I 'm sorry if I make any problem to you , but I 'm very angry and it was your fault .
I was fourteen - year - old and I was with my bestfriend , Pat .
We were in a private school , that looks like a castle , in London and we had been staying there for two months .
Our parents took us there because they wanted that we became good and polite girls .
The life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to get funny in there .
One day I discovered a secret path in the school , this path went from our bedroom to the director 's room .
I thought that was good idea told to Pat because we could use to look for exams , and then we could pass all of them .
When I told to her , she promised to me that she kept the secret .
But in a few days she told the secret to all the class . All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic and secret path to look for exams .
Then somebody told to a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents .
Nowadays , I remember this story like a bad experience .
I am writing this letter to you in order to complain for the musical show ( ' Over the Rainbow ' ) that was performed at your theatre last week ; concretely on Friday evening .
These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion about your company , which is said to be the best exhibitor of musical shows in Europe .
With all these considerations in mind , I attended the referred day to your theatre with the aim of having a perfect evening .
However , nothing was further from what really happened .
In the beginning , it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts , even though I presented an official ISIC card .
Then , the audience had to wait 45 minutes over the announced timetable for the show to get started .
And finally , when it went on , we realised that there was not Danny Brook performing , which was really disappointing .
Actually , whereas they used to talk about how their daily life had changed in comparison with previous generations ' , we remain astonished looking how our lifes are changing frenetically .
We have hardly assimilated a new technology when it is replaced or modified by another .
Electronic devices and ' gadgets ' make our daily life more comfortable and easier , but does it means that we live better than ever ?
Of course , they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines , giving us the chance to have more free - time .
However , instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity , people have become hooked on technological advances , feeding back their development in an accelerating , non - stopping race .
Machines do now most of hard work , but this does not mean that we are working less .
People spend more and more time working , searching for new inventions that will make life easier , but then fail to profit all the obtained benefits .
Thank you very much for taking us to London .
Thoug , a few of us would like to consider the " London fashion and leisure show " .
This is going to take place on tuesday march 14 at 10.00 to 19.00 .
Could you , if we may ask so , re - organise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping center .
However , none of us wishes to miss all the attractions planned in forecast .
Perhaps , we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shop center .
Every one hopes to enjoying himself and comes back with a lot of knowledge .
I thank you very much for hearing my request . I apologise for any inconvenience it could make .
I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to " the London fashion and leisure show " .
On behalf of all the students .
Yours truly .
What do famous people wish ?
Or do they want to be persecuted buy the media ?
You are rich and be - loved .
Perhaps we could call it the " rough of the smooth " .
However , to have his photos taken and showed on television and newspapers increases your popularity .
It is the way you may consider magnificent wages as it should fit your fame .
I might also miss the point .
You might be a Princess , a politician or a footballer ; but are not doing it for any fame .
You were born with the talent , sometime with the title .
You never wished to be famous that much .
Whateaver you do , the journalist should not follow you every second .
Every one deserves to be given the right of a private life .
I am writing to you to complaint about the problem that happened in the play called " Over the rainbow " , and for this reason I would like to get some money back .
The problem is that most part of the advertistment had mistakes .
First of all , there were not discount on tickets ' price , and it was advertised .
Secondly , the play was advertised at 19.30 , but it started at 20:15 .
Despite of this fact , that I did not care about it at the beginning , when the play started I did not see Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor , I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook .
But the main reason of my complaint , is that in the advertistment said it would be my perfect evening out , and it was not .
Therefore for all things I would be happy to get some money back .
The technology has affected so much my daily life .
If I had not it , I could not do most part of the things that I do today .
First of all , if I had not it , I would not be able to move out of my city because I would not have car .
But we have it , and the thing that have changed more my life has been the internet .
Nowadays with my computer , I can travel everywhere in the world , just with it connected with a modem .
internet have changed my life because with it , we can do everything at home .
For example if someday I forgot the book , with the internet I can find the book inside it , and more information .
Another thing apart from the internet and the car that has changed my life is the TV .
With the TV I can know all the information at the moment , moreover I can see films throw it .
And the best thing is that it entertaints me alone or with people .
In conclusion I think that without the technology we could not live as good as we live know , and our lives would be so much boring .
I have just receised your letter and I thanck you for your invitation and congratulations .
I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction for your perfect organisation .
About the information requested from me I have to say that I can travel only July because of my job ; I am busy until the end of June .
As regards accomodation , I prefer a longer , Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting .
My favourite sports - activities are playing tennis and basketball .
I like competitive and changelling sports , I enjoy myself comparing my skill with other players and , if possible , I rather practising sports - activities not indoor , but open air .
I would like to know if special clothes are needed and how the weather is in this period like .
I have given a questionnaire to other students of my class to know their preferences about this choise and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is Philosophy .
The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good in explaing problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject .
Also the sports - activities should be filmed ; they express an aggregative and social way of living school - life and can be useful to see and check out the moviments of the bodys during the atletics - school games .
Also the dancing lessons should be filmed , specially for the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their moviments .
I hope that these my suggestions can be accepted and appreciated .
We bought tickets for the second show , that was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15 !
We were interested on see the actors that appeard on the tickets and I was very disappointed when , in the show , we saw another actors .
The tickets were more expensive than we had expected , but we did n't care because we saw in the tickets that will be discounts for it , but , they did n't make us discounts !
With all this problems , the only thing that led us , was to eat something .
When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because people did n't arrived to work that day .
So it was the most badly evening that I had ever spend .
I asked you to consider all my reasons and turned back my money , I think is the only thing you can do .
Thank you for your comprehension
It was saturday night , and I was , with my sister Pat alone in my home .
That night I was invited to a great party , but I was punished , and I had to stayed at home with my sister .
My parents were out for the weekend .
When it was time to go to the party I decided to escape home without telling my sister , unfortunately when I arrived she was waiting me in my room .
When I enter my room she was very happy , because my father will punished me again , of course , she will tell him , but I decided to pay her if she beheaved quietly , she accepted and I payed her a lot of money .
At sunday night , when my parents arrived , they asked her if I had stayed at home on saturday , my sister beheave silence for a minute and then started laughing ; so my parents , with her laugh , know that I had go out that Saturday ; and punished me for a year .
You have a really great idea to create this sort of Festival .
I had a lot of fun to go there .
I would like to come next year with a great pleasure .
I hope you will not angry if I give you some advice ?
At first , I would like to talk about your section " Stars and Artists " .
This section is really great and attract a lot of people .
Because the spectators will probably more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities .
The concerts are fabulous but the problems are the halls .
Could you do something for these problems ?
All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of " Plays and films " . I love films and Plays also , and I 'll hope to have more films or Plays next year .
It is a good idea to have reasonably - priced for weekends .
I 'm looking forward do hearing from you ,
Yours faithfully ,

You must to be outside during the break .

I Hope these information will help you ,
Keep in touch ,
Love .
I am writing you in order to answer your questions and to get some information I would like to have .
First of all I want you to know I am really happy about the prize .
The only problem is that like I am a student I can travel only during holidays , in July . Refering to accommodation I would rather to stay in tents because I have never gone on camping so I would like to have the experience .
I am not really keen on art that is why I prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing .
If I have to be honest , I would say I have never practised none of them .
Yet , I would like to try them because my city is too far from the sea so I do n't have many opportunities of doing them .
I would appreciate if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take .
Besides , I wonder if I will share the tend or not and if I have to take it from here or if it will be provided by you .
I am looking fordward to hearing from you .
If I did n't told you the experience of the pop concert in detail in my last letter was because I did n't have time .
As few months ago I chated , by internet , to a nice guy from Buenos Aires , who happened to be one of the member of " Los Pericos " .
They have to make a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me where they were preparing the concert .
The problem was that one of the technics was from England and nobody there spoke nor a word in English so I was asked to be the interpreter .
I 'm looking fordward to hearing from you .
I have just recived your letter and I 'm very happy for it , especially becouse the competition was so hard .
Being at Camp California was one of dreams of my life and now I can relaized it .
Firstly , I could to pass this two weeks during next July only , because , before and after it , I have to working as a waiter here in my town .
However , about accommodation , I 'd prefer a log cabin , becouse it is more confortable than the tent .
All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing , because I 'm used to playing tennis during every weekends and I 'm very keen to surfing . I 'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too .
Lastly , I 'm interested about the law 's schools in California , they are very famous here .
This is a precise letter that I write you now .
Last month I visited Tom , another old friend , and he told me if I had worked with him like musician at the XZY pop concert .
Firstly , I was very embaracing during the concert , but all the staff were very kindly with me and Tom too .
This is the most important experience in my life , I knew all the people , in a particular the famous singer " Kos " .
He is funny and easy - going .
During the concert , I was near the and opposite there was " Pipe " the biggest of the world .
It 's very difficult describing all emotion I felt .
I can only tell that had been an important experience for me and for my new songs .
Excuse me Kim , but I 'm so nervous that I obn't be able to write oben this letter yet .
I hope to hearing you soon
TO THE MANAGER OF " THE CIRCLE THEATRE " AFTER FINISHING A STRESSFUL YEAR AT SCHOOL , I TOOK A SHORT HOLIDAY , WHOSE " SPLENDID ENDING " WAS A WEEK IN LONDON , WHILE I WAS THERE , I SAW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SIGN : THE " OVER THE RAINBOW " MUSICAL SHOW WAS BEING PLAYED AT YOUR THEATRE , MOREOVER , THE WONDERFUL DANNY BROOK WAS THE PROTAGONIST OF IT .
WE ASKED ABOUT " THE DISCOUNTS " THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING COULD SAY WAS :
WHILE WE WERE WAITING , WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT , AND THEN , WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED .
I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T A PLEASURE FOR US TO SEE THE SHOW , SO I HOPE YOU COULD GIVE ME OUR MONEY BACK , IF YOU CAN'T , PLEASE , AT LEAST GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION .
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN BEING IS THE HISTORY OF THE CONQUER OF THE WORLD , THAT SAID , TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINOUSLY SINCE THE BEGGINING OF MAN 'S EVOLUTIVE PROCESS , FURTHERMORE , DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES , THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION , WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM MACHINE , THE FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC BULB , THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US THE NUCLEAR ENERGY ( AND SADLY THE ATOMIC WEAPONS ) , THE COMPUTER , INTERNET AND THE TELEVISION .
TODAY , I CAN TAKE MOST OF MY SCHOOL 'S HOMEWORKS FROM THE COMPUTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND IT DOESN'T WEIGHT MORE THAN AN APPLE !
I CAN READ ALL THE NEWS AS SOON AS THEY HAPPEN AT THE VIRTUAL NEWSPAPERS AND I CAN TALK WITH MY FOREIGN FRIENDS THANKS TO THE ICQ PROGRAM , I HAD NEVER USED INTERNET BEFORE , BUT IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE , AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE .
A few days ago , as I was having a week 's holiday in London , I read your advertisement which convinced me to go to see your show : Over The Rainbow .
First of all , I was very disappointed by the fact that the actors who played were not the ones who were supposed to do it !
I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as it was written in your ad !
Finally , at the end of this very disappointing evening , I decided to go to the theatre restaurant - which was also mentioned in your ad - but I was told that this latter was closed because of a private party !
To put it in a nutshell , contrary to what was explained in the advertisement , it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back .
Actually , even though she was seventeen , she still behaved like a ten year old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret for example .
Thus when Sally explained her that she had fallen in love with Kevin , Pat felt very embarassed .
It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not , she would have prefered not to know it .
Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret , Pat ran away , when home , locked herself in her bedroom .
13 june 2000
I 'd like to tell you that the best month to travel to the U.S.A is on july because I will be on hollidays in this month .
I do n't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California , but if I can tell you wich one I prefer I 'll choose in tent .
This is because is more exciting and fun than not in log cabins .
From the list of activities to do at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming .
I 'd like to ask you about how much money I 'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next july .
I am looking to hear you very soon .
I am so glad to know that you and your family still well .
It was so easy , a mean we just carried all the instruments from the musicians to the Club and we put it on the stage .
After this , we helped to the service bar to put into the fridges all drinks and refreshments .
I enjoyed a lot doing this and at least the gig was free for all of us .
The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out . Marevellous !
Well Kim , I hope to see you soon and take care .
Two days before I read the advertisment for this show , where Danny Brook was starring .
Unfortunately last evening there was a different actor and that was very disappointing .
Apart from that the show started at 20:15 not at 19:30 , as it is written in the advertisment and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished .
I am in London for a week and I had to say that last evening I had an awful time , so I want some of my money back .
I am looking forward to receive your reply with my money .
Yesterday afternoon , when I went home , my mother want to talk me for something , so I went in her bedroom to speak with her .
She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went in a party without asked her and that she had to punish me for that .
She told me that I had to stay at home for that weekend and not to go out with my friends .
When I went in my bedroom I reliased that Pat had told my mother for the party , because noone else knew that my mother did not know that
Pat is not a reliable person so he is not my best friend anymore .
I am writting in order to complain about the musical show which name is Over the Rainbow that I could see in your theatre recently .
I like very much this musical and while I was spending some days in London I could see you advertisement so I decided to go to see it .
First of all I had problems with tickets because I could not get the discounts that you mentioned in the advertisement .
It was a pitty but it did not annoye me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 .
So I entered to the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight ( three quarters delayed ) .
Then I got nervous and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained us the reasons .
In your advertisement his name was in main letters and in the musical the actor was different .
After the show I decided to go to drink a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete to try calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the free day for the barman .
I am very indignatged because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you return my money and take notes of all these problems .
A long time ago technology was n't an important element for people because they did n't appreciate it .
Change were n't a normal situation and Governments did n't invest enough money on it .
My computer is faster and it is able to do a lot of things on that I wasted a lot of time before .
Not only are the computers useful for keep information but also computers can give you a lot of information due to Internet .
On the other hand , I realized that modern technology not is as good as people think : I hate mobiles .
I know that some people need them to work but I ca n't understand why teenagers need it .
Maybe it would be a nice idea to analize these changes and to put limits to technology , because I think that the most important is our life and no the ways we improve it .
Firstly , the show did not start on time but fourty - five minutes later .
This made me a little bit angry because I already had troubles with buying a ticket before : although it was proclaimed in the advertisement , there were no £ 15 and £ 10 discounts available .
That was why I was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing .
This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before .
Like everything had gone wrong that evening , the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill !
I am convinced to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out .
I heard somebody say " Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations " .
The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular : an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea , fighting with a strong fish he had caught .
What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up .
It becomes a fight about life or death .
He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature .
So he bares everything : the days and nights on the sea , without any food or water , the terrible summer sun , the being injured from keeping to the line where the fish is on .
The reader feels with him , wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up .
Although this situation might not very difficult or important for anybody else , it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it 's quiet , sad end .
17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir , I am writing for complaining about different points which I am very disappointing .
I was to the theatre to see the musical show called ' Over the Rainbow ' .
There I was many problems .
first of all , I bought four tickets for £ 20 each and discounts were not available .
Secondly , I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the start time was at 9:30 .
However , the show started at 20:15 . I was fed up to wait .
The worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show I realized that the actors were totally different .
They were worst than the previst actors .
After the show , my friends and I were very furious in spite of that .
I am absolutely annoyed .
In my opinion , you have to give back money because everything what you wrote in your advertisement was not true .
I hope your answer soon .
Finally , I want to say you this is the last time which I come to your theatre .
I have gone out to the street and I have asked to people for this question .
I have recollected all answers and I have made this article .
Most of people think that character people and clothes are together .
They believe that people in the future will wear confortable clothes because they will be outgoing , amused , etc .
I really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon , very exciting .
And people will wear cibernetic clothes but in the same time comfortable clothes .
From my point of view , they will be more enjoyable than people now because they will have many things to do .
On the other hand , most of people in the future will wear glasses .
It is because sunlight is very bad .
At the end all people will be short - sight .
In conclusion , I would like living in the future to check which clothes exactly they will wear .
It is a point very interesting .
I recived your letter recently , and I am really happy learning that I won the first prize .
First of all , I have to tell you that my only chance is go there in July , it does not matter the dates , but it is important for me to be back before the 1st of August , because that day I will start a summer job .
About he acommodation during those two weeks , I would rather staying in a log cabin , as it is really difficult for me to be in a little and close room .
Your next question is about the activities that I could do at the camp , after browse through the list , I would like to take part in climbing and photography activities , as these are my favourite hobbies .
I had a induction climbing course two years ago , and I still going to climbing regulary , I can do a V+ level climb .
On the other hand I had a photography course five years ago , and I took part in several competitions .
Looking forward for your answer .
Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular , the shopping centers are always busy , people going up and down carrying bags and looking at window shops , seems everbody is happy .
Sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare .
Firstly is the parking problem , if you go to shopping late at weekends for instance , it 's really difficult to find a place to park your car , and when you get the place , pay for it !
Then the search for a nice cloth starts , and when eventually you get it , it is n't your size , but also the colour that you like is not available .
Finally you 've found out something really wonderful , time to pay !
With the hurries you 've forgotten to bring any cash , but you can use the plastic money , the shop assistant pass the credit card through the machine , after few seconds again , and another time more , suddenly his face changes and says you that the card is fault !
No choice , you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad .
To sum up , shopping is not always enjoyable , but do n't worry , the shooping center still there waiting for you !
Dear Helen Ryan .
I can only travel on July because these is the mounth when I have holidays .
I 've already talked to my manager , and she said that that 's the only mounth I can have my holidays .
I would prefer to stay in log cabin because it must be cold to stay in a tent .
I have some problems with my kidneys , so I ca n't stay in on of the tents , and it also must be very comfortable to stay a log cabin .
I 've been playing Golf for five years , and I 'm a handidate cup of sixteen , but the problem is that I haven't been playing Golf for a long time because I work every day .
I 've been playing tannis since I was seven , and I 've been studying how to play tannis for a very long time , nine years .
I would like to know what kind of cloths do I need to take with me , and can you write me back what kind of weather it 's going to be there , for the time I will be staying there .
Also I would like to know how much money should I take with me , because I 'm not sure how much I 'll need to spend there .
See you Mrs Helen Ryan , and please write me back ,
I wish you were there with me helping at a pop concert .
I just loved it , I was working with these music system .
You know how good I 'm at music , anyway I was helping to these pop concert to get the corect sounds , at the bigging I was conecting all these wires into spekers , music system , guitar etc ... The particularly bit that I liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar , you know how much I love playing guitar , and all these video cameras were just filming us .
I asked on of the camera man when they 're going to show these show on tv , and he told me they 're going to show it on 10 of June , so turn on your tv on these date chanel three , and must seem me there playing with these guitar AH it was lovely .
These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see these pop concert , beleave me you 'll love it and you might use the drums , I told them that you 're really good at drums so they want to try you too .
I 'll write you soon Kim .
Tell hello to your parents !
I would like to thank you for your first prize in your competition two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
I would be grateful to except this prize .
First of all , I would like to travel in July , at present , I am doing an art course at college .
I have some pain on my back therefore I ca n't sleep in the sleeping bag on the ground .
Furthermore , I would love to do Basketball and Painting activities while I am at the Camp .
I am a member of college Basketball Team which became the best Basketball Team of last year .
Secondly , I want to do painting which I am really interested in and as a student of Art College .
Lastly , I would like to learn that what kinds of clothes I have to bring with me and how much money ( American currency - dollars ) I 'll need to have while I 'm there .
I would like to thank you for your letter which I received yesterday and I wanted to reply as soon as possible .
I know you want to learn what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month .
My friends and I have been taken to the backstage where we met the members of West Life , Elton John and Robie Williams .
I even go a bunch of flowers from them with a " thank you " letter .
What we all did was making many cups of coffees and help to find their missing socks or any other clothings .
What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties .
I particularly liked listening their musicians when they played the piano , clarinet , drums , violen etc .
Which was unbelievably great and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want .
Firstly I was very disappointed in finding out that not - ever - heard actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected .
I 'm very sorry to let you know that not only was the show really boring , but it started also 45 late -
This should n't happen !
In addition to this , I heard bad singers and noticed a numertable lack of variety in ballets .
I know this is not up to you , but it was very annoying .
This show might be the newest in London , but not the best at all .
I do eventually think it would be fair to give the spectators their money back - So ask you a complete refund ( cash ) of the ticket price .
We all know that she is n't good in keeping her mouth shut at all , but it should have been better this time .
Their parents were so happy that decided to give him a fantastic present : the brand new car he had always dreamed of .
This should be a big surprise for him : the car was bought and everything was prepared in a very hush - hush atmosphere .
Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car , but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend " It will be delievered on Thursday !
Can you imagine Philip 's face when he 'll see his favourite car out there ? "
The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual activity all over the house .
" Are you looking for these ? " asked Philip showing the keys of the car .
And disappeared heading for the rear door .
Dear Helen .
I 've been thrilled eversince I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently .
In response to the letter , I am sending mine to state the options and choice that I have made concerning the date of the trip , the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen along with some questions .
Firstly , I wish to travel on July as I already have plans for June which is to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacations commences .
Secondly , to the question of lodging , I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much .
However , as this will be my first time to go surfing , I am willing to take classes for beginners .
Lastly , I 've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would lie to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of amount of money I will have spend in the camp .
I am looking forward in being received in camp California .
I was glad to receive your letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert , I started writing as soon as I could .
I thin it 's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer !
I had so much fun helping my friends ' band having their concert .
I 'm not sure of what part you 're interested in , but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best , and I suggest that you try doing it too .
I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that was place last evening .
None of conditions was fulfilled : firstly , Danny Brook , who was going to perform in the show , was changed by another actor .
Furthermore , the show started at 20:15 while the advertisment said that it was going to begin at 19:30 .
On the other hand , it there was n't any discounts in the sell of the tickets .
I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all promises that appeared in the advertisment .
Of course , what it was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening , and I would very greatful if you refund me a compensation .
I imagine it will be very different .
Sciencist will invented new materials that will keep the temperature in a suitable range .
In that way people wo n't feel cold or hot , they will be always at the same temperature .
In addition these new material wo n't weight hardly anything .
As well , people wo n't be as worried about fashion as nowaday , however it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport or everything you have to do .
For that reason clothes will be simplier and more practise .
Besides , everybody will be able to afford to buy then that 's why the prize of this sort of material will be very available .
Of course , the resources used and manufacturing will be completely harmless for the enviroment because people will be more aware of the neccesity of taking care of the world we live in .
I write this letter because I find there were too many problems concerning your musical show : " Over the rainbow " .
At first , I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor , but she must have been changed since the actor was different .
I also want to put the stress on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm .
It is a really a shame !
In fact , if I had knowned , I would have probably stayed at home .
We can see on the advertisement that discounts are available .
And , we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant in so far as it was closed .
Indeed , there was a little paper on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness .
Consequently I ask you for some money back seeing that I think : it 's not worth the bother to loose money for such a show . ,
I think that modern technology change my daily life .
For example , if I want to buy something , I have to go on my computer and buy it .
On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we 've got more and more possibilities to enjoy ourselves since she invents a lot of products .
But on the other hand , technology 's products are sometimes cheap and I ca n't afford it .
In fact , I like technology but sometimes I wish it had n't existed since there are too many things on market .
Indeed , when you want to buy a television , for example , there are a lot of different marks .
And it 's all the more tyring since you often wait during two weeks before buying it .
I 'm bound to feel nervous .
I 'm writing this letter to complain about some aspects of the musical show " Over the rainbow " that was held in your theatre .
The first problem we had was that the discounts announced in the advertisement were not available and we had to pay the full ticket .
I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening .
Yours sincerelly
Fashion news are followed by lots of people .
People have always looked for the most comfortable clothes for they daily life .
I think that this tendence will not change but what will change is life .
We tend to a society that wants more free time so people will need more comfortable clothes to enjoy it .
Scientists are looking for new materials that will made our clothes more comfortable stronger .
Clothes will have a strong relation to the new technologies and modern devices will be included in our daily clothes .
Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected with technology and society .
Dear Mrs Jane Clark ,
With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and some suggestions for next year 's festival that you might take in consideration .
The International Arts Festival is a beautiful idea .
I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money .
In your advertisment you mentionned that there is artists and stars from all around the world coming , unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented .
I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the Festival if it is possible .
It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kind of music and to discover different culture .
Hoping that I did not offend you in any ways and that you might take in consideration my suggestion , I wish you all the best for next year 's festival organisation .
Yours faithfully
The night he came into this world , was one of grater even if for the habitants of the country or even of the town where he was born , it was a casual night .
The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up all the land .
Only the one who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was born .
When the three men saw him they fell on their knees to worship him .
The mother was pride because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins .
This little man from Israel died as the hero of all times .
His message is still as impacting today and will always be even if this story happened a long time ago .
To begin with , according to your advertisement , discount tickets were availabe .
So I could get a good seat .
To make matters worse , it was the different actor although Danny Brook should have starred .
I was really looking forward to seeing his role , but on starting the show , I found it disappointed .
Finally , I would like to ask you to give some money back to me .
I look forward to receiving your satisfactory reply by return of post .
In my opinion , modern technology has changed my daily life greatly .
When I meet my friends somewhere but can not arrive there on time , I can tell them about it with the phone .
On the other hand , when I do not want anybody to disturb my time , the phone annoys me .
With internet and E - mail , I can get lots of information from everywhere , and I can get in touch with my friends who live in abroad .
Since I bought a computer , I have been checking E - mails from my friend almost every day .
Finding them , I feel happy even if there is only one .
On balance then , I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it improves too rapidly to catch up .
Last week , I was on holiday in London , and reading the advertisement for your musical show , I had planned ( like it is said ) " a perfect evening out " .
But it turned out , it really was n't a pleasant evening , and I did n't enjoy myself .
On top of this , the advertisement was n't correct at all , or I must have been to the wrong show !
That 's nearly an hour later !
The tickets were rather expensive , and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement were n't at all available at the theatre .
I was a little hungry after the show , but then again , I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information .
Pat was my friend , I trusted her and we got on very well untill she had repeated to everyone the secret I had told her .
There was only one thing I did n't like with her : she could do anything to have friends , even betray me .
He 's travelling around the world " I would say , and everyone would admire him .
But know Pat knew , and because of her , so did everyone else : he was in prison because he had killed a man .
I knew , now , why I wanted to hide the truth .
I 'm very happy to have won in your competition .
I 'm never going in the U.S.A than I 'm very exciting to travel at Camp California .
I can to come only July because I have to work the other months of Summer .
As accomodation I 'd prefer to sleep in tents becaose I like beeing outside and earing the noises of the sea .
My two activities 's choices are Climbing and Surfing .
I used to climb and I want to try still because climbing is good for the fit . I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing make similar sensations , but I have never practised that sport .
I have one question to ask you . I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take it with me .
He does n't like stay alone at home .
I purpose that we should be filmed five topics :
A math lesson , an english lesson , a swimingpool lesson , the break and the staff room .
- At the math lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher learn at his students .
We could be filmed the class room too .
- In the swimingpool we could been in the water and doing a party of water - polo and then Allan could done acrobatics stands , because he make competitions .
- During the break we could show the activities of the students . for exemple students who play football or volleyball .
We could asked some students about the school .
We could known how this room is and what the Teachers do in this misterious room .
In the end we could show a comment of each student of our class .
I am really pleased that I have won first prize in your competition at Camp California in U.S.A.
I think it is more interesting than log cabins .
I can be more next nuture and I have never used tents before .
When I was a child , I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend having a chat , making a barbecue , playing games .
My parents were very pround of me .
Could I ask you some questions ? I would like to know which kind of clothes I should bring to the camp .
How much money should I bring there and can I use my credit card at the camp ?
I 'm sorry that I 've taken such a long time to reply your letter because I 'm really busy and I have to study harder .
Last month , I worked as a part - time job .
Before the concert I was really exciting . I could n't sleep well and I did n't know what I had to do in the concert .
There were lots of singers and band .
Of course , there were lots of spectaculars .
I was really exciting .
My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well .
After that , I went to the back stage .
I 'm sorry that I did n't ask them to take any pictures for you .
I had to take care of them and did everything they want .
For instance , taking them to toilet , making coffee for them , helping them find their stuff .
I learnt lots of thing from here that I could n't learn from school .
I knew lots of people from different job .
It was a great time .
I 'd like to say something that I felt during the festival , and give my opinions that would be helpul for you to prepare for the next festival to you .
First of all , I appreicate you for organizing such an exciting festival .
It was a great idea , and I enjoyed myself to this festival so much .
By the way , according to the advertisement , lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival , but I was able to meet them just from only six countries .
And another thing is that some concert halls were too small , so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded , and during the concerts people felt stuffy .
I hope you 'll get much bigger concerts hall next year .
On the other hand , plays and films were excellent .
I expect that much more various kinds of plays and films will be on next year .
Finally , I 'd like to mention reasonably - priced weekend ticket .
It was brillient , because if I had to pay all things each I would n't have attended it , because it was very expensive for me .
Thank you very much about that .
Long time ago , there were two brothers , whose parents were dead .
By the way , the elder brother , Nolbu was a so greedy man .
He did n't want to share the money with his brother , Hungbu so he took all of the money , and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything .
Hungbu had nothing but his twelve family .
But , even if he was so poor , he was so good and had a lot of affection about the people who were much poorer than his family , so he looked after them .
One cold day , Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing , so the bird could n't fly to the warmer county during the winter .
He cured the bird to fly with love , and the bird was able to fly .
The following year , when the bird returned his house , he gave him a message .
It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers hid .
People belive that the bird was sent by heaven .
So in order to keep myself occupied for a while , I went to the restaurant except it was n't open .
The show it self was quite disappointing .
Anyway , after watching the musical , I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with hope that it might be open , but still , nobody was in .
He said it was because the runner of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day .
So I am going to ask for a refund ... I hope this is n't affending you too much ...
When it comes down to color , I think it 'll be much brighter and maybe glittery .
Like shiny and plastic kind . Maybe silver and gold , glittery red , purple and blue .
Colors to match the clothes .
I think I 'll be fine in the clothes we have now ... I mean , I wo n't get sick in them !
First of all I would like to thank you for the perfect organisation of the competition which I luckely won , I have been really very impressed .
Unfortunately I became your letter with two weeks late so I can travel only between the 5th and the 20th July .
In fact I will finish my university 's exams only on the first July and after the 20th is impossible because I am going to do four weeks volontary in India for UNICEF .
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabins , because , in spite of my love for nature , I am terribly allergic to pollins .
So stay in a log cabins will probably evite me a lot of problems .
Choose two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing , sport in which I have many years of experience , and surfing despite I really have any experience .
Unfortunately I had ever been in the US so I have any idea about how much money I will probably need and about what kind of clothes I have to take with me .
Thank you very much for your attencion on my regard
Your sincerely
If you ask at twenty womans what is their favorite hobbies probably the most of them will answer " shopping " .
Why so many people have been contaged by this " psychologic virus " ?
We are always trying to have more things , that in spite of care after us family , us future , or other things which are probably more important than a new perfum .
Always more people , everywhere , are becoming shopping - addicts .
Maybe you can think I am excessive but recent studies prouves that this mania can be really dangerous .
Certenly the only fact of have something can helps people to be more sure of himself .
In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein model for a certain kind of people you are cool , but it is really so important ?
Probably when Oscar Wilde said : " Superficiality is the suprem vice " he was right .
Dear Mr. Smith ;
I am writing this letter to make you know the bad points of the theatre .
It was wrote in the newspaper that Danny Brock took place in the play .
If there had been a problem , it would have been told us .
I wanted to see him but I could n't see .
But in the newspaper it was wrote to be a discount . I paid £ 20 to the cashier .
Because I did n't enjoy at the theatre .
I hope you would not continue like this .
But if they were n't made , we would have to walk or go by a horse or donkey .
With the help of technology , we do our works in less time .
For example ; in the past people used horses to go another place .
And their life passed in the ways .
But now we use planes to go far places .
And computers , the most important product of technology .
In the world , people spend the whole day by playing computers .
They use computers for their works .
They connect with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers .
They write their secret notes into the computers .
But in the past people had to use lots of note books and they also had to find places to hide them .
But it has also bad points .
For example ; wars .
Using technology scientists make lots of powerful guns .
It is bad for the world 's piece .
I think we should use the technology for the piece and use it for our fortune .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the show you presented two weeks ago at your theatre .
As I was spending a week - end in London I took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors , Danny Brook .
Unfortunately as soon as I came to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore .
Besides , since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we had n't had any dinner , as we had been thinking to have it at your restaurant .
You can not imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring ; as a matter of fact , after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast - food .
In conclusion , I would like to have the two tickets refunded considering also that there were no discounts available , as instead it was stated in the advertisement .
In fact this was the main cause of Mr White 's resignation and suicide .
Pat was not a very clever teen - ager and while she was attending the Secondary School she had many troubles with Chemistry .
I could actually say that if it had n't been for Mr. White she would have never passed her exam to enter University .
Mr White came to our school when he was 40 year - old but still well - looking and all my girls school - mates fell suddenly in love with him ; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girls felt herself loved by him : Pat certainly was one of them .
Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mate and she run away as fast as she could .
She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen .
The next day Mr White was charged for abuses and obliged to resign .
The trial was long and had a wide coverage by media .
We live in a small and old fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster : loosing his job was hard for him , but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him ; so , on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died terrified by the darkness which was nearing .
